"answer: It should be noted most of the expensive drugs are USA exclusive.  You can get most drugs cheaper online.\n\nMy drug for example is $35 for 30 day supply, if I got name brand in the usa it would be $2,400 fr same amount.  That is how fucked up the system is.\n\nIn fact I buy all my perscription drugs online now, online pharmacy offer %100 resend of meds if customs takes it.

"answer: That's like asking why aren't there any car crashes that make the car run faster afterward.\n\nThe human body is an incredibly complicated, delicately balanced biological machine.  There are millions of ways to through it out of balance, but only a few ways to improve it.  Any random change is likely to be a change for the worse."

"answer: If you want to be a public figure, then you give up some rights to privacy when in public."
answer: You definitely adapt to the temperatures. When I was in the Middle East in 2003 during my service it was about 120-140 every day during the summer. After a few weeks of suffering and drinking a few gallons of water a day it got much easier to cope with the temps and my water consumption went way down and I was still just as hydrated. When it got to November and the temps got down into the 90s we all wore sweaters and jackets because it felt so cold.  So I'd say your body adapts as well as your mind.
"answer: I'm not American, but that price seems high. [This](_URL_9_) seems to indicate significantly cheaper costs to patients.\nIf you look at the cost breakdown for a unit of blood product, banking, testing, separating, and acquiring blood is not cheap and makes up a significant portion of the cost. \nAlso remember that just because ""everyone"" would want to donate doesn't imply those people would be of the needed type, disease free, and able to donate safely."
answer: If you want to have some crazy dreams that you will remember and make your sleep feel longer try eating some stuff with B12 vitamins in it. The easiest way I've found is to eat some cheese or bananas before going to bed.
"answer: In addition to integrating social media with YouTube, they're trying to detoxify the environment around YouTube comments by making you attach your name to them instead of remaining anonymous.\n\nI'm less likely to troll someone for their race, skin color, or native language with my name attached to the comment."
answer: Capital has suceesfully destroyed the labor movement. Simple as that's. Through propaganda they have convinced the people to vote out of their self interest and have undone the progress made in the 1880's through the 1950's
"answer: All the reasons presented here are spot on. I'd like to add another consideration that hasn't been mentioned.\n\nI grew up and a very diverse city, my high school had about or maybe just over 3,000 students from every nationality you would think of; there were over 40 native languages in my school. However, ALL of the standardized testing was done in English. There was no option for Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, nothing. Only English. So, as you can imagine, non-native English speakers often times failed due to just a simple language barrier. This always infuriated me, my high school was technically a ""failing"" school, but how can accurately assess someone's knowledge if you're not willing to do so in their native tongue? I just don't get.\n\nSo you have that issue on top of all the other issues mentioned in this thread."
"answer: Yes, and you're tasting these things too, without the necessary means to describe them. In the same way as a child a German Shepherd and a Rottweiler were both just ""dog"", your palate just needs a better vocabulary. Consider that the taste of a drink can change wildly between multiple variables (age, temperature, etc;) and you're absolutely going to find more subtle notes the longer you spend critiquing it.\n\nThere's a pretty interesting (albeit pretentious) documentary on Netflix called ""Somm"" that takes a look into the world of sommeliers (wine stewards) I'd recommend if you wanted to see just how refined your palate can become."
"answer: And they had more kids, too! Most people today have only one, and two at most."
answer: I replied just because you said not to.
"answer: It's probably cultural, just like how the black community has it's own accent and cadences(which white people who grow up in black communities also have just like black people who grew up in white communities don't have it), the gay community adopted its own in an attempt to form a cultural identity. The preconception is that homosexual males tend to be more effeminate than their straight counterparts (whether or not this is actually true) so it just kind of became expected. What I want to know is what came first, the stereotype or the cadence?"
"answer: Nothing would happen if you called the US President by his first name in the US.\n\nHowever, the same can't be said for many other countries. It depends on the country and its laws."
"answer: Our solar system is basically made of a bunch of really old vacuum cleaners. I mean REALLY old. And we call them planets and moons.\n\nOver about 5,000,000,000 years, they've been flying around in circles sucking up everything they could find.\n\nThey're really really good at getting rid of stuff floating around out there.\n\nImagine if your grandma and about 250 of her friends had been vacuuming the living room floor constantly for 5 billion years.\n\nIt'd be pretty clean.\n\nIf you go skipping across that floor, the odds of you getting even a spec of dust on your feet is as crazy low as anything you can imagine. Even lower than my chances of ever dating Scarlett Johansson.\n\nTHAT low.\n\ntl;dr There's really nothing out there **to** hit the New Horizon."
"answer: I know this will only get buried, but there was a documentary on this exact topic. The trailer alone will answer your question.\n\n[**LINK:** Do I Sound Gay?](_URL_2_)"
"answer: Your respirations, or breaths in and out, become more shallow and rapid (ex. Hyperventilating). This causes your oxygen (good air) levels to drop, and your carbon dioxide (bad air) levels in the blood to rise. Blood sugar at this time is obsolete (irrelevant). Next time you feel angry, try to focus on slowing down your breaths. You will not get nauseous. \n\nEdit: Holy shit I read this wrong. Hungry not angry. I wondered why everyone was getting so off topic. Agree with first comment. Your blood sugars are not consistent. If you keep glucose levels...uh, level throughout the day you should never have that feeling. In other words, eat small meals every 2-3 hrs, even if you are fat. And don't freaking starve yourself. It's lame."
"answer: It also ensures that the animal is getting all of the nutrients they need. And, in animals that don't forage, the food is usually placed in a few specific places in the enclosure or on specific platforms that the animals are conditioned to know are used for feeding. That way, the least amount of food goes to waste as possible.\n\nHere's an example: I worked as a camp counselor for two summers at a small zoo near me. Because one of the camp themes was focused on what you need to do to take care of the animals (essentially turning the kids into mini zookeepers for two weeks) and we had to walk through everything we would be doing with the kids, we got to prepare food for and feed the animals.\n\nNow, one of the animals was a polar bear. Instead of throwing chunks of fish and whatever else into it's enclosure where the polar bear may not find them/where they'd rot, we would have to make special meatballs and roll them under a special door in the enclosure where the polar bear was waiting to catch them. These meatballs not only had fish, but also had vitamin and mineral powder mixed in as well as some kelp and a fair amount of fat and meat from some other meat source (I want to say venison or something like that) to ensure that she got as realistic a diet as possible living in captivity."

"answer: A lot of animals are well known to commit suicide. A lot of new parrot owners may find themselves being instructed not to leave their bird alone. If you end up in a situation where your parrot is alone a lot, it could start self harming or commit suicide from loneliness. It may be recommended to purchase two birds for some species."
"answer: Nation building is a waste of time and resources and is a failed  doctrine. When the people of Iraq collectively want peace, prosperity, security they will create it for themselves. This cannot be for forced on a society they must want it. All nations on earth have created their own realities. As for the Iraqi army, the men are like teenagers, almost even childlike in their disposition.  Sadly, nothing will ever amount to land that is Iraq, having spent time there I am convinced it is cursed, it's people destined to continue this existence of war, death, corruption, sadness. It is a failed state,  a failed people."
"answer: Animals do commit suicide. Suicide is not a uniquely human experience, nor uniquely mammalian."
answer: Both. As a 8th grader I spent the whole (european) winter in a t-shirt and simply told myself to ignore the cold and try to not shake.\n\nSimiliar like I tell myself that I don't care about anything to not be nervous when going into a presentation.\n\nAccording to *Psychology Today* there are many benefits in self manipulation via talking to yourself.
answer: You also have to remember that the last 6 outs are extremely hard outs to get. Especially in a World Series game. That is why bullpen importance is trending higher than it ever has in the history of the game. Your starting to see some of your better pitchers come out of the bullpen nowadays and the really great ones sometimes will make the transition to a starter. The numbers for bullpen pitchers are skewed bc one inning of severe damage could jack your E.R.A. up. But you don't make it to the World Series or the postseason for that matter without a great bullpen.

Seems an oddly narrow fix, not sure if it ended up passing anyway."

"answer: Have you ever listened to a train coming torwards you blaring it's horn? Notice how the pitch gets high when it's approaching you? That happens when the sound waves from the horn get compressed in front of it because of the train moving. When the train passes, the pitch becomes lower for the same reason. Here is an illustration that describes what I'm saying. [Image](_URL_0_)\n\nBecause light sorta behaves like a wave just like sound, the same exact thing happens when things giving off light move. But instead of the pitch changing, we see the color change. If it's moving away, the light waves gets stretched, so it moves torwards the red side of the spectrum (redshift). When it's moving torwards us, the waves gets compressed and move torwards the blue side of the sepctrum (blue shift)."
"answer: Blue eyes and blond hair, (platinum blonde), and red hair are genetic mutations that occurred in Europe. Sexual selection of people with those mutations caused there to be more and more of them.

"answer: Just going to say, I don't think this is exclusively an 'American thing', but more a part of Anglophone culture.\n\nMoving out when you're a young adult is still, culturally, the 'done thing' in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, NZ etc. \n\nIt's about independence, and being 'king of your own castle'.\n\nI only live a couple of miles from my Mum, but have lived away from home since aged 18 (apart from a 6 month stretch when I was 21. \n\nI was happier in my own space.\n\nI does help that I'm in a part of the country where property prices are dirt cheap - moving out in your early 20s or before is still the norm.\n\nMy wife has family in South East England, and they don't have the same luxury; it's causing them quite a lot of upset and frustration tbh. Their parents want them to be able to move out, but even a small flat is about Â£200k, and rent is extortionate. \n\nI expect, culturally, we're going to see more of a North/South divide on the whole 'moving out' culture in the UK."
"answer: MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. \n\nHowever, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations.\n\nWhen it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to ""skin popping"", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial ""intradermal"" injection. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. All those nasty pictures you've seen floating around Reddit of ""krokodil"" users and their horrid necrotizing skin infections are the result of chronic skin popping and IM drug injection."
"answer: I have never worked a job for long (still a student), so I do not have too much wisdom to add to this discussion, but in the few weeks I worked at an office everyone (on that part of the floor) spent 3 hours of their normal payday checking their bank accounts and discussing who had already received their pay check. After seeing this I can't really imagine talking about the amounts is a taboo (and I know that these people waste tons of time). I am from the Netherlands btw so maybe one of my fellow countrymen can enlighten me on the general consensus in our homeland."
"answer: The Baby Boomers were born when there were only 3 billion people on the planet - i.e they were competing with a much lower number of people than people born today. There were so few people on the planet they didn't have to compete with people outside their country i.e. globalization didn't exist. The increase in population increased the demand for housing (and other non renewable resources) and therefore that house they purchased for bugger all in their 20s is now worth a huge amount more. For that same thing to happen to people born today, population would need to hit 14-16 billion, pretty sure the earth would be destroyed by that number of people on the planet at once.\n\nStory time: I remember when I was a kid, my parents were looking to buy land. They could purchase 65 acres of land 5km from the beach or 50 acres on the beach for around $70,000. Because stainless steel and other corrosion resistant materials were expensive or were unavailable, very few people lived near the beach - they purchased the property away from the beach. The plot of land at the beach they didn't purchase, sold 3 years ago for $60 million."
"answer: You need a bed frame to create a space underneath that will become a place for dust bunnies and cats to hide in. It is also a good place for wayward socks to migrate to...a place to throw your book that you are reading before sleep...a hide out for the monsters of your mind.  \nPeople. Do yourselves a favor. When buying a mattress, buy the best one you can afford. The quality of sleep is far superior and a good mattress will last a very long time. Just do not invest in the beds that sport a 2 foot box spring and a 2 foot mattress. Man oh man, those things require a ladder to get into and a parachute to get out of safely."
answer: Why aren't the gulf states taking in Syrian refugees?
"answer: The system is intended to prevent people from (a) building unsafe things that could fall and hurt somebody, and (b) reducing the property value of nearby homes. For example, I shouldn't be allowed to build a factory in my backyard, since that reduces the value of my neighor's homes and therefore in some sense I'm ""stealing"" their money.\n\nIn the case of a chicken coop? Sounds like you annoyed a neighbor who dislikes chickens and found a technicality that you were guilty of."

"answer: Large scale farming and plantation was possible because of slave labor; without its valuable agricultural exports, America wouldn't have achieved economic sustainability. America's ability to be independent was thanks to slave labor, making slaves a vital part of the country's history.\n\nThe African slaves also created a unique community which adds to the broader American identity as a mixing pot, like any other immigrant population - though they were the only one brought here unwillingly, incidentally. \n\nLastly, owing to that agricultural foundation, the American practice of slavery continued past that of other superpowers and its cessation lead to global consequences.\n\nSlavery was a cruel practice with no room in civilized society, and it's important to study and preserve its roots in order to appreciate its continued effect - including the first-world's current dependence upon third-world slave labor."

"answer: The government did ""bail out"" homeowners, but not by handing them money (which would be impossible to account for).  \n\nUnder a government program, I was able to refinance my mortgage despite being moderately underwater.  My monthly payments went down 25%.  My interest rate is among the lowest in US history, which was also due to government action.  Around the same time, there were huge government incentives for first time home buyers."

"answer: 1. Some ""discoveries"" are announced by exuberant researchers, usually grad students, then later die in peer review or replication.\n\n2. 12 years and $2.6mil. That's the initial cost to bring a medication from concept to FDA approval. If the potential patient population (market) isn't there, nobody is going to risk the capital to fund this process.\n\nWant a solid example? Cluster headaches. There is no approved (on-label) treatment for this disorder. Not because medicines to treat it don't exist. . .but because it's such a rare condition, there is no way for a pharmaceutical company to recapture the cost of developing the drug."
"answer: Home brewer here. The simple answer to your question is yes. I've been drinking a smorgasbord of different beers that claim different varieties of flavors and I can tell you if you drink enough you will start to notice. A lot of people usually can't tell what specific flavors they're tasting, because they don't know exactly what they're noticing, it's just beer flavor. If you drink enough of anything, you can start noticing different subtleties in them all."

How the hell is it cloud like?)\n\nThere have been advances in what can be offered on remote systems, like Amazon's AWS that lets you make virtual machines, subnets, databases and all sorts of crap that scale and all that nice stuff, but essentially yeah, it's still just a remote system doing something at your behest.\n\nProbably the marketing teams behind it figured it'd be easier to just pretend it's some new computer magic rather than explain it's just a new service that lets you do new things over the network that traditionally you wouldn't or could not."
"answer: Let's throw some future analogy into the mix.\n\nIf we keep our pace with innovations, some people would want to replace some body parts with mechanical or bioengineered ones. Maybe not even humanoid. Say, a couple of tentacles on each side of your body instead of human arms.\n\n""But why, you weren't born mechanical! Just be yourself!""\n\nDoes that change much for you, if you feel you'd be better off with mechanical hands instead of the ones you were born with? You know the pros and cons of this, you really feel you should be that way.\n\nNow say, you weren't born with some body parts and looks you feel you should have. Is it different? Should we forbid plastic surgery? Should we feel bad about people changing their gender-specific parts?\n\nI think, we cannot rule it for other people, how they must look and whatever. Well, it's me, and I'm curing my body so it becomes well. It becomes right. Consciousness defines a person much more than body.\n\nTL;DR: consciousness defines a person more than body. You can't swap girl's mind to be boy's and vice versa, but you can fix the body to match the mind. It's easier and feels like it's the logical thing to do."
"answer: I'm not extremely well informed about this, but Eastern Ukraine is generally more Russian and Western Ukraine more Western-European. SO the conflict starts when the President of Ukraine (from the East) decides to stand in the way of the Europeanization of Ukraine (something about the EU, not sure if they were joining or just trying to take steps to join the EU, but they would be leaving some sort of economic pact with Russia for it). People in the west get pissed because they don't even like Russia, so they rise up and overthrow the Pro-Russian government, but there are still many Pro-Russians in Eastern Ukraine, and so Russia steps in to seize a warm water port that they always wanted, and also to protect the wishes of the Pro-Russian population in Eastern Russia. What is their real motive? Probably the warm water port. But I wouldn't really know, and I doubt many people really do. People talk about Putin controlling media in Russia but with all that has happened in the last few years I doubt the people of any country really have control of their own media."

answer: In the UK at least the inner city is still dominated by those less fortunate. During the industrial revolution the inner-city city was more of a slum for the factory workers. These poor quality houses have only started to be improved within the last 30(?)years or so. Gentrification has helped with inviting the wealthy upper classes into the inner-city and out of the suburbs by turning old tenement buildings into luxury apartments this does unfortunately drive the original poorer community out due to not being able to afford the new much higher rent.
"answer: I've lived on my own four a combined total of 4 years in the 6 years since I graduated college.  I'm living with my folks now because I was diagnosed with a series of crippling illnesses and then succumbed, for a period, to major depression that debilitated me in every way you could imagine.  But I'm back on my feet, I'm working full time and making decent money.  I really want to venture back out because, while I love my family, I have a lot of anxiety just because they have something to say about everything I do (or don't do) and they've just become unbearably pushy about a lot of seemingly inconsequential things.  I feel I'd benefit from being out from under them but I'm afraid that if I try to buy a house and I take a turn for the worse, I may find myself unable to honor my financial obligations if I'm unable to work.  I'm really conflicted as to what to do next......."

"answer: The reason is because they are very charming and superficial. They will try to generate stimuli through laughter and/or interest, because that's what they want to experience themselves and to make you more interested in them as a person.\n\nThat's why they come across so likeable, it's the obvious way to get someone to like you, which is why psychopaths do it.\n\n(One last thing) You said sociopaths not psychopaths. Sociopaths are psychopaths but more out of society, more impulsive, more criminal behaviour that is violence oriented. They are not as charming and likeable as psychopaths. Though they often are."
"answer: It's not supposed to be a large sum of cash. It is supposed to be a refunded inconvenient amount of cash. Eg if a student is arrested for theft, set his bail at $500, so that he shows up for court. He really needs that $500, so he will show up to get it back. A rich person may have bail set at 10k since that would be an inconvenient amount to lose. So in come bail bondsmen, who now operate by default.  Bail bondsmen will pay your bail amount, for a 10% fee. So theoretically, you should now be paying less, though it will not be refunded. However, Courts assume you will use one, so now they set your bail at 10x the amount they would have. For a student on a petty crime, bail will be 5k. The student now has to pay that bail bondsmen $500 to loan that money for a few weeks. This works out great for the bondsmen as a high interest loan. For the courts it gives them free enforcement to pick up people who skip court. Great for everyone except the people being arrested. This is similar to other punitive fines, inconveniences, and 'fees' used to extract money from people who cannot fight back. See DUI fees, disproportionate juvenile sentencing, voting rights removal, prison lobbyists, etc for more details."

But sometimes I think its a little hypocritical because whenever I greet him on the phone or after work sometimes I notice that my voice gets a little higher when I'm with him. At work or anywhere else my voice falls to ""normal"" range. But when he's around my voice gets softer and higher.... I don't know why."
"answer: My guess on these things is the type of people unstable enough to kill anybody often don't think it rational, long-term options.  Hollywood movies aside, you'd have to be both murderous AND cunning on a level that would simply be too rare of a ""sweet spot"" for presidential assassination.\n\nFirst, you'd have to have an actual motive.  And that's seriously long term.  The president you wanted to kill is long out of office by the time you get to that level.  Terrorists from other countries just wouldn't make it because of the culture shock, the background checks, and so on.\n\nOkay, suppose you're a psychotic from Oklahoma that decided at age 8 that you'd kill any president, no matter what their political affiliation.  Just ""a president"" would do.  Somehow, you have to be sane enough to pass some serious psychological exams and tests just to get into the secret service.  And be very athletically fit.  Now, you'd hang around a lot of these guys on your off hours, and I would imagine to get into the ""inner circle,"" you'd have to be socially aware enough not to give someone who might be your future supporters the heebie-jeebies.  I am sure there are a lot of people who don't get promoted because their never get recommended.  \n\n*""Yeah, Jim Smith is a great bodyguard.  Really dedicated, and very fit.  Perfect record.  But... he's got this odd temper.  Doesn't play well with others.  Doesn't seem to have any friends, lives by himself in a very minimalist apartment, and his family is either all crazy or missing.  Not sure if I want him next to the football, if you get my drift.""*\n\nAnd as another poster here suggested, the second a gun is pulled out without reason, the others would be on you like a hobo on a ham sandwich.  Seeing these guys in action, in less than 2 seconds, both you and the president would be under piles of people.  Then within 5- 10 seconds, the president would be in an armored car and speeding away.\n\nThe conditions would have to be *just right* to pull this off, and I think the chances are far too remote with ""easier options"" being too tempting for a would be killer."

"answer: From my understanding, it's that although geographically speaking, Indians are ""Asian"", they're really not. We tend to base race on two things 1) looks (with an emphasis on skin color) and 2) culture. \n\nWhen looking at race Asians are lumped together because at a glance ""they all look the same"", the same goes for Caucasians, Hispanics, and Africans as well. Indians and Arabs, however tend to not be lumped into any of the aforementioned groups because of the two earlier points. \n\n\nIndians, Arabs, and even Jews, could, for the most part, could and would be considered Caucasian if skin color and culture weren't as big of a deal as they are. \n\nOf course,  all that being said, race is used as a social clnstruct used to generally describe someone physically and culturally and Indians aren't considered Africans because they're not similar enough to fit the bill."

"answer: I would argue that it is their worldview and culture. Freedom didn't take hold in Europe until the Reformation, where the church lost some of its political power, and values like honesty, hard-work and the rule of law (vs. the divine right of kings) took hold. \n\nIn 1400, Europe was an ass-backwards shithole. By the 1600s, you have great advancements in art, science, music, navigation, limited government, etc."

answer: Doctors pepper their practices with various types. United and Aetna being the 2 hardest to collect from they only take on a few of those. So they take on other patients from HMO's they are guaranteed a check every moth from these. They also pepper in Medicaid and Medicare patients as well because their contracts are negotiated at rock bottom prices. \n\nInsurance's also will drop doctors some times as well so she/he isn't in your providers coverage. \n\nSource: Wife does medical billing for 3 hospitals up here had to have her explain all this crap like I'm 2 when I got my cancer diagnosis. Also your doctors are as clueless as you about this this is why they hire office managers.
"answer: > I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol..\n\nA proxy is 'another server' through which you do all of your browsing.  So in a default situation, you are 'directly connected'.  You browse to a website and your ISP's servers handle this for you.  When you hit reddit, reddit can store your IP address or any information against you.  Also your ISP knows that you went to _URL_1_.  Oh and if reddit decides to show you one of those adverts, you'll see a ""meet hot girls in  < yourarea >  tonight!""\n\nWhen you introduce a proxy, it forwards the request for you.  You are telling the proxy 'I want _URL_1_' and the proxy server goes out, gets it for you and sends it back.  That makes a big difference.  That means that if you browse to reddit using a proxy, reddit sees the proxy's IP address.  If it does an IP-address-to-geographical-location-lookup, it will think you are wherever the proxy server is, rather than your actual location, so it might say ""meet girls in [low earth orbit](_URL_0_) tonight!"".  There are of course many different types of proxies, and some proxies will forward your IP address to the server, others will hide it for you and anonymize you as much as possible.  \n\nExample usage: the front page of reddit almost always has some Colbert video clip which everyone is celebrating together and you are left out because you are a pitiful foreigner.  Well, you could go through a proxy based in the US.  Because Colbert's website sees the proxy's IP address, it may think you are in the US and let you watch the video.\n\nOther examples, suppose you want to visit a website which you are not comfortable leaving your 'information' on.  Think torrent sites.  You went to a torrent site and downloaded a car.  A few days later, authorities seize their servers and your IP address is on their web server logs.  They can find you then.  So what some people do is they browse the torrent site through a proxy and download a car.  When the servers are seized, all the authorities see are the proxy's IP address.  Whether or not they can get YOUR IP address from that proxy server depends on the proxy server owner.  The owner may choose to not store any info about you at all and the owner may choose to store the info."
"answer: I think of it like this. As a driver, you not only have a chance of being harmed, but you also pose a risk of harming others. The minimum required insurance is to help the other party should you injure them. Health insurance is only to protect you. One could see it as unconstitutional because it should be the sole choice of the individual if he or she pays to protect his or her own health and welfare."
"answer: Just going to Copy-Paste from another thread I replied to:\n\nOk, I do netsec  &  net eng so without going into super specifics let's give this a whirl:\n\n > but is it now also possible Google to sell my browsing data\n\nIt always was, and they do. Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves. That is where their money comes from.\n\nThe thing is google doesn't have all your browsing data. Google has your search history, any tracking done through their ad services, your email, your location if you use google maps, and basically anything you do on chrome or stock android, especially if you are signed in.\n\nNow google themselves uses this information to provide a very good service. Ever wonder why google searches tend to be the best? Well not only are they the biggest, but because of their user profile, they know what you want.\n\nTake a member of /r/the_donald and /r/politics. Have those two users both search the word ""impeach"" and they will get two different suggestion lists. While both will likely have ""Impeach Obama"" and ""Impeach Trump"" they will likely be in different order.\n\nThis is because google is predicting what you want based on previous search history  &  email keywords (yes google scans your email).\n\nNow google provides **excellent** service, but there is a price to pay for it. On the internet if you are not paying for something you can assume you are the product being sold.\n\nUnless of course google is your ISP. Then they get everything, because they can see everything.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nOnto what *YOU* can do about it. Get yourself a VPN (Virtual private Network).\n\nThere are many providers, I myself use NORDVPN, but they aren't the most popular due to some customer service issues, and they aren't the most secure if you aren't running on openVPN. The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.\n\nBut if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.\n\nOn to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?\n\nA VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel  &  routes all your internet traffic through that.\n\nSo instead of seeing:\n\n* workacct1484 connects to _URL_1_ \n* workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad\n* workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from  < nodes > \n\nmy ISP instead sees:\n\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to  < Server > \n\nSo my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they *could* sell my browsing data, it would be useless.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_0_)\n\nNow you might say to yourself, ""Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue  &  subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?""\n\nYes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:\n\n* MPAA sues  &  demands VPN logs\n* VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.\n* MPAA curses\n\nNow if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.\n\nHow do we get around this? TOR:\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nTOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.\n\nWhat does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well you don't connect to _URL_1_. do a traceroute to even _URL_2_  &  you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_3_)\n\nThis does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first  &  last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is **NOT** easy, but it *CAN* be done.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSo if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.\n\nSecond get a VPN.\n\nThird use TOR over that VPN.\n\nFourth, start calling your representatives  &  telling them how you feel, then GET OUT  &  VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.\n\nFinally, realize you lack the money  &  expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nAnd finally what does this mean for you?\n\nFor the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. \n\n#GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.\n\nThey are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.\n\nBut why should you care?\n\nBecause these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data  &  sees you looking for a new job  &  fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history  &  sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to  < Local Credit Union > .com and now can focus their attack.\n\nIf you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in ""private"" browsing modes.\n\nAnd because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not ""free"" and there are no realistic competitive options.\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask."

Many Altzheimers patients become angry and blame others for what they are going though. \n\nWe are still trying to get my mother in law diagnosed and it's almost been two years."
"answer: Might also have to do with relative humidity. Normally in the winter the air is much dryer (notice how much more static electricity is on freshly dried clothes in the winter as oppose to the summer?). Anyways, the more relative humidity there is the hotter the air feels to you because it cannot accept as much perspiration. Similar to how people say places like Vegas and Phoenix had ""dry heat"" a ""dry cold"" will feel much cooler than a cold temperature with higher humidity. Also, if you look at psychometric charts you'll notice that cold air is naturally less humid. Therefore, when you're heating the cold outside air in your house, and not adding humidity the air will feel colder at 60 degrees than air that's outside at the same temp. Sorry for such a long answer but I finally got a chance to use some of that HVAC knowledge from my building mechanical systems class."
"answer: Bacteria 'generally' need oxygen, a safe pH, moisture, and favorable temperature to survive/grow. Salt is hydrophilic, so it removes the moisture from things that have moisture. When you salt something, you are technically starting a 'cooking' process. Check out books on cooking theory, it will open your mind as to what kinds of things you can do to create awesome dishes. Learning a solid cooking theory is kind of like learning the fundementals of how to draw. Once you learn your theory, you can apply it to all sorts of food based on what they are made up of (is it a watery veggie, is it a starchy veggie, is it a solid fruit, does it break down when you add heat very quickly, etc) and it will make it easier to cook things that you haven't worked with before. You can use theory to really focus on creativity rather than copying things you find online without knowing why you add the salt to and wrap the sliced zuchinni with paper towels before grilling it."

answer: Zoologist here.\n\nA surprisingly common method of transport can be attributed to birds. \nFish commonly lay eggs in similar areas to where water/wading birds are found and it is not unusual for some eggs to become attached to said birds as they wade/swim in a certain waterway.\n\nThese birds may move between a number of different waters in search for all sorts of all sorts of things and can naturally deposit eggs from another water. Sort of like pollinating insects.
"answer: It costs an employer money to hire an employee.  They have to spend time looking for them, and then spend time training them. They also come to rely on that employee to be there to do work.  \n\nOverqualified employees are seen as more likely to leave a job when they have the opportunity to do so. As a result, all of those sunk costs are more likely to be lost to the employer faster than with a qualified employee.  \n\nBeyond that, there are also considerations of morale and fit. Although certainly not often the case, it happens that ""overqualified"" people might think that a job is beneath them and therefore not take that job or others at that level seriously.  This can lead to bad work and even poison the whole work environment. \n\nThose are the two principal reasons that this can be an issue."

"answer: Nothing on this Earth is a closed system. Period. There are places that come close, like Madagascar (The only place my current drunk ass can think of at the moment), where life evolves down its own little pathway, almost completely independent of the rest of the world.  \n  \nI remember a story of a tomato plant growing on some god-forsaken no life hell of a volcano perimeter, and the reason it got there?

"answer: Cosmology is the study of the cosmos itself (e.g. the expansion of space, the Big Bang, relativity), and astrophysics is the study of the objects in the cosmos (e.g. how stars work and galaxies form). There's a lot of overlap; for example, the astrophysical problem of how galaxies can rotate so fast without tearing apart introduces the cosmological problem of what dark matter is and how it got here.\n\nModern astronomy might as well be called ""observational astrophysics""; it's about looking at what things in space are doing and figuring out why. An astronomer will generally concern himself with finding data that can test astrophysical/cosmological theories and hypotheses."
answer: Relative humidity levels. Air Conditioning removes Humidity. High humidity levels make you feel warm and sticky. So despite both being 60 degrees the higher relative humidity outside makes it feel warmer than the air Conditioned space. Why do you think it is called air Conditioning? You are conditioning the air by removing the humidity. A/c primarily removes humidity/latent heat and Secondarily removes measurable heat/temperature. \n\nJust a humble HVAC tech.

"answer: One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU.\n\nCountries in the EU have to let people from other EU countries live and work there with no restrictions. This has resulted in a large number of people coming from less wealthy countries such as Poland coming to live in the wealthier ones including the UK.\n\nSome people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. Although this is statistically not true in the average case.\n\nOther people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment. However now many British businesses and organisations are likely to face a shortage of workers.\n\nAnd finally some people don't like how society has changed due to immigration. There are many more non-English speakers than there used to be, and there are lots of shops around catering to various immigrant groups. This makes some people feel like it's ""not their country any more""."

"answer: I was not underwater. I worked hard, saved and paid 50% down on my mortgage. ($100,000). Then I was badly injured and couldn't work for 4 years. I have been unable to get hired at a full time job ever since (I am currently 18 months behind on Payments). A judge ordered the insurance settlement from the accident be split between three victims instead of each victim getting a separate settlement. The settlement share wasn't enough to stop foreclosure on my home. I applied for mortgage help through two different government plans. I didn't qualify for either one. The mortgage bailouts were only for the so called ""sub prime"" victims and victims of what was termed mortgage fraud where payments were allegedly mismanaged or misdirected by certain banks. There was no help for those of us who did everything right and got behind through no fault of our own. I sued to gain time but it is only a delaying tactic. I will be homeless in 3 months. I will lose everything I worked so hard for and still no job."
"answer: Much of it has to do with how the government believes society should deal with crime. If you believe people are at their core natures shitty, then those people can't be rehabilitated in order to save them from themselves. The only hope is that you provide enough a deterrent with dire consequences to prevent them from doing crime, as bad people only respect power.  Thomas Hobbes basically put this idea forward in *The Leviathan.*\n\nIf you believe people are innocent and angelic at birth, as Jean Jeaque Rosseau did, and that society corrupts them, then society should deal with crime through rehabilitation.  For what person would continue trying to make their rights wrong when everything around them continually reminds them of their mistakes and refuses to let them move on?  A primarily penalizing society would rob a good person of any hope of redemption, and he or she would fall back into despair and regret, giving up on doing the right thing.\n\nI myself believe Hobbes leans more toward the truth, but people don't have to be angels in order not to be devils. They can be uneducated, misguided, and dare I say, innocent or ignorant, and living in a free society gives them the opportunity to better themselves and ""move towards the light,"" so to speak.\n\nPlus the prisons want to make a profit."
"answer: 3 things: infant mortality, death in childbirth, and lack of a safety net.\n\nBefore a safety net, your children were your Medicare and Social Security. If you didn't have kids, you weren't going to have someone to care for you when you got too old to work. That was a huge problem, so people tried to maximize their chances of children who would outlive them.\n\nThis brings us to the other two points. Infant and child mortality used to be really high. In Ancient Rome, there was about a 50/50 chance of a kid living past their 10th birthday. So, if you wanted to have kids who survived into adulthood, you'd need to have a lot of children to ensure that some would survive. As a result, women needed to start having children as soon as they were fertile to maximize the chances. But, lots of women died in childbirth, meaning it was even more important to have kids as early as possible, so that the man could remarry and have more kids who would be able to survive and care for him in his old age."
"answer: Maybe they have synesthesia? Speaking as someone who had no interest in wine until I drank one magical chablis, I can tell you that wine made me taste a whole scene in my mouth.\n\nMy favorite wine (that I've never been able to find again! ;_;) tasted like a foggy beach just before dawn, when the light is still blue, and you can smell the salt in the air and taste it in your throat, and you feel the coolness of the sand on your feet, and succulents are somehow involved, and the fog glides over the waves as they gently crash on the shore.\n\nNow the wine didn't taste salty or sandy or like succulents, but I've learned since then what particular flavors my weird ass brain was picking up on. The wine I had was very dry with flinty notes and some tartness.\n\nBut the previous description is way better, and was how the taste /felt/ when I drank it.\n\nI try to imagine that wine descriptions aren't 90% bs and that someone really felt all the delightful things they tasted when they had it, because there definitely is a higher incidence of synesthesia in people in creative professions, so it isn't a huge leap to think that some of the people who taste these things have some hint of it!"
"answer: if voting day was a national holiday, i feel like a lot of people ... wouldn't take that day off to vote. It doesn't make sense...but it makes sense. The excuse to be late because you were at the polls ... works well enough. The fact that you're already out and about for the day, with shit to do so you take some time to go vote. I can't speak for everyone obviously, but, a ""holiday"" means ... day off. Making plans (or not making plans), that don't involve standing in line to vote. It's like, it would almost become even MORE inconvenient."

From those views, I've made around $12,000 to $15,000 in total.\n\nThere are two ways I make money:\n\n1. Ads. Everybody claims they make 1-2$/1000 views. This isn't accurate for most people. The average is 0.80$/1000 views.\n\n2. Licensing. This is when companies license a video you created. They will usually pay a lump sum of 100-250$ USD for video rights.\n\nOther ways:\n\n3. Product Placement. Simple enough. A company will pay a YouTuber to show a product in their video. Ex: Pepsi could pay PewDiePie $20K to drink a Pepsi in his video. \n\n4. Merchandise Store. If you're large enough that you have dedicated fans, these fans will buy your merch."

"answer: ""Stan"" means land. It is related to the Latin word ""state"", the German word for city, ""Stadt"" and the English suffix -stead, found in words like ""homestead"" and ""farmstead"" and in place names like ""Hampstead"" and ""Stansted"". \n\nThe word ""stan"" can be traced back to the same original root word as the European ""state/stadt/stead"" varieties, because all these words derive from the same ancient theorised language, Proto Indo-European."
"answer: Male monozygotic (identical/single egg) twin here. My twin brother and I are the same height, weight, shoe size, and we share the same contact lens prescription. He is hetero and I am gay. We grew up in the same household and without any traumatic events, so should be a pretty good case study. We're both turning 29 this year.\n\nThe affect/dialect, along with the mannerisms, are both a nature and nurture development:\n-visual gender role modelling is a critical factor, if not the ""trigger"" factor\n-a chemical or biological change occurs pre-10 that strengthens/supplements the initial gender role modelling\n-there is most definitely a biological point of no return sometime pre-puberty\n\nThis would account for the difference in the pitch of my brother and my voice despite our diaphragms, chests, ribs, etc sharing the same measurements. \nNotes: \n-My brother role modeled our father, I did not\n-Neither of us exhibits a gay dialect, as this as unlearned/compensated for at a young age on my part, but I definitely noticed the beginnings of both a gay affect and manner in myself at around 13 \n\nA developed gay man does not adopt the affect or mannerisms for social reasons. Pre-10 gay male children are a great example of this, as they frequently exhibit the affect and mannerisms before learning social awareness.\n\nBut maybe the most important argument I can make here is that if you're a gay male who speaks and acts outwardly like a hetero male, a conscious effort is being made to reduce the manner/dialect. You can imagine it like drinking too much caffeine. That feeling of being ""wired"" is similar to the lack of control a gay male has over their affect or mannerisms. Any corrective behaviour is usually learned through visual role modelling of masculine figures, which is why it's not uncommon to see a gay male overcorrecting with hypermasculine voice and body language. After dating many gay men from both the Vancouver and Seattle areas, I can tell you that not one of them was without a slight gay affect in their most relaxed environment, and most of them claim initially to be straight acting - the only difference is self awareness."

"answer: Many devote muslims, even fanatics are women but they typically aren't used as fighters for the same reasons why warriors have traditionally been male in all cultures.  Those reasons are compounded by the fact that extremest Islam is very hostile to the idea of women leaving ""their place.""\n\nIt's not common for ISIS and groups like it to recruit people from middle class.  Most are from slums that never really integrated into the country the immigrated to.  The few that were better off (which likely includes the British man who executed that Journalist) are likely motivated by strong religious convictions.\n\nWhy educated people develop fanatical religious convictions is a whole other big topic that I won't go into right now."

"answer: Think of how you'd use a knife to cut something tough in the kitchen, like say, a potato.  Now, you could swing the knife forcefully to chop it in half, but  unless you're very good, you're not going to cut exactly where you wanted to, you'll also risk chopping off your fingers or damaging your knife, which would be bad.  The proper way to slice is to place the blade on the item in question, and apply regular downward pressure while pulling/pushing the blade towards/away from you.  This lets the blade act like a blade rather than just a wedge.  The principle is the same with the guillotine.  The lower part of the blade makes contact with the chap's neck first, and because the blade is slanted, it slides *relatively* along his neck.   The point of contact between the blade and the neck moves in 2 dimensions, rather than just one, even though the blade is only moving in one dimension."

Elephants and wales don't give birth to many offspring, and they raise them for a longer time. On the other end of the spectrum, you have insects that don't care for the offspring very much and they breed prolifically. Somewhere in between you have animals that birth in medium sized batches and they put some considerable effort into, but not more than a year or so."

"answer: This is basically what my father did when he knew he was dying of cancer. All assets were transferred to my mother or a legal trust he had setup. His life insurance paid out to the trust only, and not his estate. He then opened and maxed out as many lines of debt as possible, which he used to pay off the mortgage. When he died, the house and cars were paid off, but yours estate had no assets to recover the debt. I believe of mother had a tax bill for the payments made to *her* assets, which was paid to keep the IRS happy. As far as I know, it was all perfectly legal."

Some places have lots more sex on tv and less violence on tv for cultural reasons (looking at u germany). \n\n*This is my very uneducated take on it from an individual level*. -- But i guess you could also describe the phenomena using neurology and psychology.

"answer: Passing out protects your body from excessive stress or injury. If you are forced to continue (in action movies or sci fi they sometimes have people who allegedly can't feel pain or can run at top speed forever) cells would run out of energy and joints can get injured.\n\nSometimes it's a system shut down. A punch or blow that causes your brain to hit the side of the skull (usually your brain is floating in a liquid which protects it from concussions) which can overwhelm it and cause it to shut down (like rebooting your PC but not exactly)\n\nAnother could be an interruption of how your biology needs to function. Think about a sleeper hold. Your brain needs a constant supply of blood to stay functional. Squeezing the carotid arteries cuts blood from the brain and it shuts down. But this example has less to do with protecting your body than a system shutdown, like pulling the power cord to your computer."
"answer: Generally speaking, it costs a lot to bring a drug to market. R & D costs are high, and then the FDA puts it through a lengthy and costly evaluation process. So while it may be true that it is $1 worth of medicine, that ignores millions of dollars that went into the development that need to be recouped to turn a profit on the drug. The company gets a patent on the drug for a time that helps with that, but when it becomes generic the price will drop a good bit. \n\nGovernment intervention of various types could bring prices down, but too much intervention could end up disincentivizing R & D."

"answer: I'm probably too late for this shindig, but there's an important component I see many people missing, and this is, in my view, the most important reason we read books like Huck Finn, The Great Gatsby, and Pride and Prejudice.\n\nYes, part of the answer here is the 'canon', i.e. there's a (possibly arbitrary) group of central texts chosen by old white dudes with Oedipus complexes. Look at other comments for answers about the canon.\n\nNow, I have a problem with the 'canon' answer because it's overly simplified, and is often used as a false comfort. 'The Canon' is the answer people want to hear if they don't understand why they're being made to read *The Great Gatsby*. That is, if you're just bored by *The Great Gatsby*, it's comforting to say, ""Well, some boring old white dudes arbitrarily decided I should read this when really it's just boring drivel that has no relevance to modern life and that's Fitzgerald's fault, not mine, let's move on to Harry Potter. Fuck the canon, it's racist."" (The canon is, indeed, pretty racist, but let's move on)\n\n**Something I don't see people talking about, however, is literary tradition, which I see as the more significant reason to read writers like Fitzgerald and Steinbeck.**\n\nTo explain: writers read each other. Whom writers read and whom writers like will impact their own work. Toni Morrison's *Beloved* is illuminated if, afterwards, you read Faulkner. Morrison wrote a Ph.D. on Faulkner for cryin' out loud. That doesn't mean you can't read *Beloved* without *As I Lay Dying*; it simply means Beloved will be a different, and more interesting book if you do. You can't fully appreciate J.G. Ballard unless you also understand Joseph Conrad. J.G. Ballard is basically using the exact same metaphors as Conrad, just updated and less racist. He's admitted as such. If you read Virginia Woolf before you read Ursula K. Le Guin, you'll be amazed by the connections you'll make. The texts dance with each other. It doesn't matter that Le Guin writes Science Fiction and Woolf writes in the mode of Modernism--Le Guin has been heavily influenced by Woolf, and reading the two together is very enlightening.\n\nAnd then come the two giants of them all: Shakespeare and The Bible. Look, you can read literature without having read any Shakespeare or any of the Bible, but that doesn't mean you'll be erasing the ginormous impact these works have had on literature. In the most fundamental ways, the language of The Bible has seeped into the entire umbrella of English literature. Even if you don't know it as a writer, you're either adopting the ways The Bible uses words, or rebelling against it. No matter what, you're always responding to it. It doesn't even need to be purposeful on your part.\n\nSo, yes, there's an aspect of 'the canon', but the canon wasn't just chosen by stuffy old white men. It was also chosen by writers, and a writer worth their salt will have read from the canon, and will know what interests them, and what they think is missing. To track this progression can give us insight into the way dialogues in our culture develop. It isn't arbitrary that Toni Morrison is following in Faulkner's footsteps, and it certainly isn't because some old white dudes told her to and that was that.\n\nPart of the issue is that high school students don't necessarily have the perspective available to approach some of these texts, and it's often in high school where these texts are read. For example, what does an expedition down the misty Congo river have to offer to someone going into engineering, or politics, or environmental science? I think the reason a book like Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* evades us is because books like it are often taught in the wrong way.\n\nHere are some ways to rethink some of the writers you didn't appreciate in high school:\n\n**Jane Austen** is the Lena Dunham of Gentry Era fiction. She's a ruthlessly observational genius filled with radical ideas about women and romance. She's totally brutal, too. A good high school teacher will guide you to see how fucking hilarious Jane Austen is. She's a bitch, and she knows it, and she doesn't care. For example, There's a whole section in Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Bingley attempts to justify his bad handwriting by arguing that he's just really smart and thinks too quickly. Austen writes this dialogue so perfectly, so cunningly that, in the end, her character Elizabeth totally brings Mr. Bingley down to size. We've all met people like Mr. Bingley, is the thing. However, if you don't understand how Austen's humor works, it could come off as simply gentle banter. Furthermore, her legacy is still felt today.\n\n**Joseph Conrad** fathered (or at least perfected) a certain kind of thinking. His works combine intense societal critiques through the power of individual consciousness. Basically, he's one of the original ""the personal is the political"". Even if you don't like *Heart of Darkness*, you're never escaping its impact (which has been followed by many great socialist thinkers btw).\n\n**Mark Twain** basically created American literature. It was mostly very puritan before he came along to satirize the moralization and piety of American literature coming before him. There's no way in hell that some stuffy white men facilitated this. American writers like John Steinbeck, Faulkner, Don Delillo and I'd even argue Bret Easton Ellis have all learned lessons from Mark Twain. His lasting impression isn't because a couple of Harvard deans standing around in a room smoking cigars suddenly decided he's interesting. It's because he's a great writer, and writers after him have either copied him or tried to repurpose his techniques.\n\n **Shakespeare** literally somehow captured and predicted every single literary movement that has happened and probably will ever happen. If you feel a certain way, Shakespeare has written about it. If you don't like Shakespeare, it isn't because you're right. It's because you didn't have a good professor to guide you. I know that may make you feel insecure. How could one dude be so amazing? Well, he was, and you need to deal with it. Shakespeare is the only writer I can say this about with absolute confidence. With the proper introduction, he's one of the most fascinating writers (if not *the* most). But he absolutely needs a guide.\n\nThis goes into the very purpose of literature, which is this: if we want political progress, scientific progress, mathematical progress, we need to know how to redefine our own personal vocabularies. All great writers have, in some way or another, reinvigorated or dismantled the old cliches of their times to document the cultural, intellectual, and psychic changes they observed. Writers give us language we can use to explore our experiences, and reading in terms of a tradition helps us see how languages and conversations develop.\n\nIf you want to dismantle the cliches of conservative America, or SJW liberals, or Orthodox Christians, it helps tremendously to see how geniuses have done so in their own contexts."

"answer: My mom used to work in a senior center and they had a woman who had early stage Alzheimer's. The only real problem they ran into was that she kept asking where her husband was. He had died several years prior, and her daughter (who brought her daily to the center) would remind her in the car that he was gone. It meant this poor woman got dropped off in misery because she was feeling the grief freshly. It was terrible. Finally, the daughter began to tell her mother that ""dad was at the store"" or that ""he was working on the house."" It allowed this woman pleasure and didn't end up hurting her.\n\nHaving a fact sheet like that that could remind a person of their situation could only add to their suffering.

"answer: Anyone and everyone *can* have a magnetic personality once you know what someone is interested in/likes/ etc....it's just a matter of displaying traits that are deemed ""likeable"", while keeping to yourself traits which would be deemed ""undesirable"". There really isn't much rocket science behind it. Sociopaths are no exception, they just generally pick up on these traits quicker because it's more important to them in getting to their end goal (being liked, manipulation, whatever). Im trying to stick to the ELI5 mentality here, so I guess basically (without getting into the depth and ability that sociopaths experience empathy) , you don't need to really even relate/connect with someone to get them to like you. It simply takes understanding what a person likes in someone else and then exploiting it."

You can see an example [in this old painting](_URL_0_).\n\n2) Battles didn't descend into disorderly chaos very frequently.  Armies survive on discipline and cohesion, more than any other factor.  So for the most part, you would stick in a tight group with the rest of your unit, and it would be pretty obvious who was in your unit and who wasn't.\n\n3) Simply yelling.  If a unit got separated, an officer might try to re-group it by yelling for his men to get back into formation.  The average soldier would also be yelling a battle cry, partly to induce fear in the enemy and partly as a unit identifier.  Language and accent would help identify who was who."
