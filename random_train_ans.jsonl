Either by cable (pulling) or a hydraulic action, a pivoted lever on the gearbox bell housing pushes back a fork attached around the outer side of the clutch plate on the gearbox side and its this movement of the fork that moves the plate back and disengage it from the  permanently turning side on the engine...\nConversly, when you let the the clutch pedal up by its spring. it will get to a biting poin, this is when the gearbox clutch plate starts touching the engine and you will then feel the car moving. It's an incredibly simple idea.\nAlso when clutches slip, it means the grippy surface of the clutch has worn down beyond what the resting point of the resting clutch pedal, or the cable would need adjustment. Hope that helps explain the movements going on as you press down on a clutch pedal."}]}

If I wanted to buy your loaf of bread, since it's the only thing either of us has in the whole economy, you might want $1.50 for it.  The price of bread is $1.50, and I have two loafs of bread, and you have $3.00.  The equivalent of 2 loafs of bread.  \n\nI cultivate and plant some seeds, grow some wheat, mill the wheat, bake a loaf of bread.  Now I have 2 loafs of bread and you have one loaf of bread.  \n\nI have created more wealth.  You haven't lost anything.  If you wanted to buy half of a loaf of my bread, I might sell it to you for 50 cents  Then we both have a loaf and a half of bread, but I have $2.00 and you have $1.00.    \n\nWe've established a loaf of bread is worth about $1.00.  Now I have a 1.5 loaves of bread and 2 dollars, so I have about 3.5 loaves of bread worth of wealth.  You have $1.00 and 1.5 loaves of bread, so you have about 2.5 loaves of bread worth of wealth. \n\nIn this scenario, I have the equivalent of 3.5 loaves of bread and you have the equivalent of 2.5 loaves of bread.   Together there is a real 3 loaves of bread in the economy, and you have a real 1.5 loaves.  This is better in all cases than the first scenario where you have no more than 2 loaves of bread, and there are only 2 loaves of bread in the world.  Yes, you have only $1.00 and before you had $1.50, but the addition of another loaf of bread to the economy reduced the price of bread, and your $1.00 end up in this circumstance buying just as much bread as your $1.50 did. \n\nAny time we do something to make something that didn't exist before it creates wealth.  How we handle money is different though.  I could decide to sell you my half loaf when the price is still $1.50 and get $0.75 from it, and you could go and grow and make the next loaf.  Then you have 2.5 loaves, and $0.75, and I would have 0.5 loaves and $2.25.  If there are $3 and 3 loaves, and so we say that a loaf is worth $1, then I have 2.75 loaves worth of bread and you would have 3.25 loaf equivalents.  It's not as favorable as the previous scenario when the sale is made after the price drop, but still both parties see their wealth increase. \n\nNow, the party growing the bread could keep the price of bread high, and then you could see trades that left the buyer worse off.  But even then, the wealth of the entire system still increases. \n\nUntil you eat the bread."}]}

You don't really see it in front of you, your brain is wired to make you assume you're seeing something in front of you (if your eyes were retransplanted in the back of your head, you'd instinctively think what you're seeing is \"in front you\", at least for a while). What's happening is signals from your eyes go to the visual cortex and light neurons up in a particular way. This lighting up of certain neurons is assumed to correspond to something in front of you.\n\nWhen you visually imagine something you're lighting up the same neurons (in some sense). The signal is not coming from your eyes this time, it's coming from whatever part of your brain is capable of inventing something to see.

It's a logical question with either a yes or a no answer.  Quantum teleportation of information has to do with a phenomenon known as \"Quantum Entanglement\" which means that particles are connected sort of like twins are connected in horror films. What one particle knows, the other inevitably knows no matter how far away they are. \n\nOur method of sending and receiving information is limited by the speed of light. For example, we send out phone calls in radio waves which move at the speed of light, this is what photonic (photons are the particles that make up not only visible light, but radio/infared/ultraviolet etc) quantum bits are.  Quantum teleportation, in theory, would work because the twin particles seem to \"learn together\" without having to send data to the other one.\n\nSay we have a few sets of 'twin particles' here on Earth and in a lab on the face of the sun. On Earth we have all the 'older twins' and in our lab on the sun we have all the 'second born twins.' We have this lab stationed on the sun to alert us of when the sun explodes. Now imagine that the sun exploded; it would take 8 minutes for us on Earth to see the explosion happen, and we would have no time to react. The lab, being on the surface of the sun, gets this information the instant it happens. Because our particles here on Earth are entangled with the ones in that lab, we now know on Earth that the sun has just exploded and we have about 8 minutes to prepare our defenses against our impending death. \n\n\nTL;DR - Conventional sending/receiving of bits of information are limited by the speed of light. Quantum Entanglement suggests that pairs of particles are connected in a special way such that if one particle 'learns' something, its partner instantly learns it as well, regardless of the distance between them."}]}

But a bee can also will also get caught in a trap that  any human could figure out how to escape. \n\nAnother issue is the fact that it's very difficult to determine whether an animal can do something or not.  Most research into animal intelligence is done with dogs, not because dogs are especially smart, but because they're one of the few animals that want to what humans ask.  We can't do much research with cats, for instance, because a cat just does whatever it wants. It could be perfectly capable of solving a puzzle we lay out, but we can't distinguish between a cat that can't and one that won't.  \n\nI'll leave you with the Douglas Adams quote : \"For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much\u2014the wheel, New York, wars and so on\u2014whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.

Full disclosure: I am an applied mathematician, and so hope to eventually provide some arguments in favor of the *clarity* of logic that the appropriate application of mathematics can provide.\n\nBut first, I must *agree* with you in part: I think there are very real problems with the practical misuse of statistics in particular, or of mathematics in general.  You mention that you studied law; hopefully *logic* enters into the consideration of validity of legal arguments... but as soon as *numbers* start to creep into those arguments, trouble often ensues.  You may be interested in the book \"Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom\" by [Schneps and Colmez](_URL_0_).\n\nAt a high level, I think this impression of being able to \"argue any desired view\" with a cherry-picked statistical approach boils down to one or both of two basic problems:\n\nFirst: misuse of a mathematical model of a situation.  Here the problem is that mathematics is clean, while the real world is typically messy.  That is, it is useful to be able to quantify the existence, nature, or extent of relationships between things that we observe.  We can try to model those relationships mathematically... but the more realistic the model, the more complex it is to analyze.  We sometimes have to trade fidelity for simplicity, and sometimes scientists make the wrong choices in that tradeoff.\n\n(A natural example of this is hurricane forecasting: in principle, the \"best\" mathematical model of the weather is to model the \"microscopic\" interactions between every individual particle in the atmosphere, so that \"macroscopic\" phenomena like the creation and motion of a hurricane are the *result* of the model.  But such a model would be prohibitively large and time-consuming; instead, another approach is to treat a \"hurricane\" as an actual element of the model, with its macroscopic behavior (rotational motion, etc.) \"hard-wired,\" and thus *implicitly assumed*, into the model.  This is a trade-off, since we may \"miss\" some important real-world behavior that isn't accounted for in the model.)\n\nThe second problem: misinterpretation of the results of a statistical analysis.  As a mathematician, this is the one that frustrates me the most about statistics.  Here the problem is that the mathematical analysis *really* tells us one thing, while it is often *interpreted* as saying something different/more than that.\n\nExamples of this that fit the ELI5 criteria are difficult to come up with.  An easy target is the use of p-values; let me know if an actual detailed example would be useful."}]}
{"id": "31m33z", "input": "How could the 'Butterfly Effect' literally work?", "output": [{"answer": "\u201cKnots\u201d are the layman\u2019s term for trigger points. Trigger points are focal areas of hyper irritable tissue with an increased and/or spontaneous electrical activity. There are two types of trigger points: active and latent. Active trigger points cause pain at the site and a referral site. Latent trigger points are not painful at the site, and may or may not cause referral patterns. \nThe origin of trigger points is a slightly contested topic. The best article I\u2019ve read as to what causes TrPs was where the researchers dissected cadavers in hopes to find them. They didn\u2019t. Supporting the hypotheses that they are caused by the spontaneous and/or increased electrical activity. After we die, there\u2019s no more nerve conduction and thus no more trigger points. (I\u2019ll try to find that article)\nThere are also other reasons these pop up. It can be secondary to overloading a muscle that is not built for the activity or amount of force generation you are asking of it. It can also be secondary to poor nutrition, dehydration, etc. \nThe first part is where physical therapists come in. We will assess the TrPs and can attack them in various ways. Invasively via dry needling, aggressively via IASTM (instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization or Graston the big brand name), a few different types of manual therapy and mobilization\u2019s as well. However, the main reason to see a PT is to assess your movement pattern for those compensations. Specifically, say your rotator cuff is weak, you have terrible posture, and have a long commute and/or a desk job. Odds are you have tight upper traps with more knots than a Wal-Mart parking lot has speed bumps. That rotator cuff does more than rotate, it supports and stabilizes the shoulder joint. If it\u2019s weak then the upper trap may compensate to stabilize the scapula so the other muscles crossing the shoulder joint itself just stabilize the ball and socket part of the shoulder. The upper trap doesn\u2019t get a break and eventually develops those TrPs. \nAs for the mindset behind fascial adhesions (something I\u2019ve seen a few people discussing on this thread), it\u2019s a bit of a different theory. \n\nSource: New grad DPT, heavy in the research, and studying for my national boards."}]}

The Police tell them that if they both confess to the crime, they will both get 2 years in jail, if the both deny they both get 1 year, however if one confesses and one denies, the person who confesses will get let off the hook while the other person gets 3 years in Jail.\nObviously, the best outcome is for them both to deny, but what comes from studying this problem through the lens of Game Theory is that this outcome will never happen - Think about it from the Prisoners perspective: \nIf you know for sure the other person is going to deny, your best strategy is to confess - You might send the other person to jail for 3 years but you get off, so win!\nIf you know for sure the other person is going to confess, your best strategy is to also confess, because that way you avoid going to jail for 3 years and you both go to jail for 2.\nWhat's important here is that *no matter what the other person does, your pay-off is always better if you confess and therefore will always confess*\n\nObviously this is a pretty simple example, but you could imagine when there are many different people playing that happens over many different periods it can get quite complicated to see intuitively what's going to happen, so you need Game Theory to analyse the logic, lay it out step by step to see how the game is going to play out."}]}

Every time you shorten the length of a string by pushing your finger down on it it would play a higher frequency because its less string to vibrate (less string = more resistance = higher frequencies). The frets are placed where they are a certain guideline to make sure we are playing the proper frequencies. They also signify the point in the string where if you pushed it would play a frequency that is say for example a d rather than a d sharp.  Not all guitars have frets, there are fretless basses which really sound sweet but the player must be able to know exactly where is fingers must go to play the proper note.\n\nTl;dr a string plays a certain frequency based on its weight and tightness.

In the 1980's, under some trade deal that was rife with rumor, the US built an immense military / air base outside Casablanca.  Officially it was an emergency landing location for the space shuttle if the launch failed after a certain altitude.  Local rumor, unconfirmed, was that it was also a \"first strike\" base.

Also, at about the same time, ATT completely rebuilt Morocco's telephony infrastructure; it was a common joke that you could call any city in the world easier than across the street.\n\nMorocco became the beneficiary of the Lebanese civil war.  Wealthy Gulf state sheikh's and their parties used to go to Beirut's casinos to gamble, drink and womanize, but the war stopped that and Morocco offered the same with benefit of Arabic language, culture, and perceived safety.\n\nMorocco is basically peaceful due to a reasonable series of kings.

Size - Hard drives are designed as a series of platters (like little CDs).  If you want to increase the storage of a drive, you can either increase the storage density on a platter or add additional platters.  Since they're thin and relatively small, they can be stacked, and can be made to fit within the same casing.  Flash drives are actual physical chips that are wired into the circuit board, so they can't be stacked.  They can increase the storage density of a chip as the technology improves, but you can't really stack them as efficiently as hard drive platters, so the storage capacity increases more slowly.  This is why you can find a 2TB hard drive that's the same size as a 128GB solid state drive.\n\n2. Longevity - I'll admit I don't understand this one myself, but a traditional hard drive supposedly has several orders of magnitude more read/write cycles available during its life than a solid state drive.

{"id": "71ptiq", "input": "If there is water on Mars, why can\u2019t one of the rovers be directed to the suspected source and simply confirm or deny speculations?", "output": [{"answer": "Honestly, the answer is kind of complex and complicated and not really all that simple.  Historically, the Jews are different than any other ethnic group in that, they've never really had a homeland until recently (Israel only came to be about 50-60 years ago).  So they are different than the Irish or the Chinese or the blacks or any other ethnic group people have hated/currently hate in that they didn't have a homeland to \"send them back to\".\n\nNobody is a big fan of the homeless people wandering around their country and essentially that's what the Jews have been throughout history.  They had no homeland to call their own and were thus perceived as vagabonds and nomads trying to live among the \"natives\".  These weren't people who chose to leave their home and live in your town.  Those people we can relate to because our town is way better than theirs obviously.  These are people who live amongst us simply because they have no home of their own.\n\nOn top of this you factor in their financial success.  For a variety of reasons Jews tend to become wealthy and hold positions of power.  No one likes rich people.  Look around today and look at how many \"evil rich people\" there are and how much people hate them.  This hasn't changed.  \n\nSo, now you have a nomadic minority wandering around your home town and they have more money/power/success than you do.  It's going to breed resentment.  You already have a great scapegoat - rich, minority, nomads.  What more do you really need, but on top of this you add the religious element.  Now you have Jews practicing a religion that is very different from the pantheistic religions that are popular and furthermore it teaches that they and they alone are right.  It leads them to behave in ways that are odd to neighbors (like not working on Saturdays) which just leads to more differences and we tend to hate those who are different from us.\n\nBut if this weren't enough, add on top of that historical events that seemed to affect everyone except the Jews. The Black Plague killed like half of Europe and affected Jews as well, just not to the extent of Gentiles.  This was partly because of the ritual hygenic practices that Jews followed as well as them simply keeping cats around while their neighbors felt that cats were evil (yet another reason to hate the Jews).  The cats simply kept the rat population that spread the plague away.  On top of all of this add to the fact that Jesus was killed by Jews and it's just one more log on the fire.\n\nSo, when you see anti-semitism spreading through Europe (and even America) before WWII and even today it's not just a simple one reason response.  It's a complex series of reasons.  A nomadic people without a homeland and they practice an odd religion and they are more successful than you are and the problems that affect you don't affect them at all.  You have a breeding ground of resentment there which just leads to outright hatred in the end.  These are just the reasons I came up with off the top of my head.  I'm sure there are far more. \n\nTLDR - It's complicated and there's no simple explanation."}]}

When the stuff meet, each will try to hold on to the stuff around it. If it's not strong enough it breaks into smaller and smaller stuff as it all tries to get out of the way of each other. \n\n\nNormal stuff we pick up breaks pretty easy all things considered. We can even experience when molocules break down. Normal chemical reactions and such. Nuclear energy, enough to power cities (or destroy them) is how much you need to break down atoms. When we want to break down protons, we need particle accelerators, flinging stuff near the speed of light. \n\n\nSo basically when our two pieces of stuff collide, you'll get a big explosion as it's ripped apart down to it's quarks and electrons because even those forces that hold them together can't hold on strong enough."}]}

For most published authors I know (myself included) the theme and metaphor of a story is not the first thing you think about, but it usually starts to come out spontaneously as you progress through the first draft. \n\nIf, for example, you were to set out thinking \"I'm gonna write a story about impermanence and how it creates meaning in a human life\", you'd probably end up laying it on too thick and bashing the reader over the head with it.\n\nBut sometimes you start a story about, say, 'robot meets girl, robot falls for girl, robot outlives girl and has to come to terms with it' - the more direct aspects of a plot in other words, and by the end of your initial draft you say to yourself \"aha, I'm not writing a story about a robot and a girl at all, I'm writing a story about impermanence!\". Once that happens, you usually go back and pull out the theme in your later drafts, gradually adding metaphor and symbolism in to reinforce it, but always keeping it in the background, hinted at and subtle.\n\nIf I was James Joyce I could probably start out straight with a larger theme of the human condition in mind, but I ain't, so this is how it works for me and most of the other semi-pro writers in my circle."}]}

The proposed answer I like best is that crying is a way for the body to dump stress hormones very quickly, rather than let them decompose regularly. Thats backed up by the fact that \"emotional\" crying has much higher levels corticotropin(stress hormones) than tears from physical pain/eye irritation, and can be found in saliva as well\n\nAlternatively, it is also thought that tears serve as a form of communication- a visible sign of defensive submission or empathy. Somebody crying generally isnt a threat and can be ignored. Crying a funeral proves they cared about the mutual loved one, and can be trusted as an ally."}]}

{"id": "4ji8ef", "input": "Why are some animals tasty and some not? Would we be tasty if prepared properly?", "output": [{"answer": "TL;DR: just like lightning rods allow lightning to pass from the roof of a building safely to the ground, aircraft allow the lightning to pass around sensitive parts of the aircraft and exit out the other side.\n\nAlthough passengers and crew may see a flash and hear a loud noise if lightning strikes their plane, nothing serious should happen because of the careful lightning protection engineered into the aircraft and its sensitive components. Initially, the lightning will attach to an extremity such as the nose or wing tip. The airplane then flies through the lightning flash, which reattaches itself to the fuselage at other locations while the airplane is in the electric \"circuit\" between the cloud regions of opposite polarity. The current will travel through the conductive exterior skin and structures of the aircraft and exit off some other extremity, such as the tail. Pilots occasionally report temporary flickering of lights or short-lived interference with instruments.\n\nMost aircraft skins consist primarily of aluminum, which conducts electricity very well. By making sure that no gaps exist in this conductive path, the engineer can assure that most of the lightning current will remain on the exterior of the aircraft. Some modern aircraft are made of advanced composite materials, which by themselves are significantly less conductive than aluminum. In this case, the composites contain an embedded layer of conductive fibers or screens designed to carry lightning currents.\n\nModern passenger jets have miles of wires and dozens of computers and other instruments that control everything from the engines to the passengers' headsets. These computers, like all computers, are sometimes susceptible to upset from power surges. So, in addition to safeguarding the aircraft's exterior, the lightning protection engineer must make sure that no damaging surges or transients can reach the sensitive equipment inside the aircraft. Lightning traveling on the exterior skin of an aircraft has the potential to induce transients into wires or equipment beneath the skin. These transients are called lightning indirect effects. Careful shielding, grounding and the application of surge suppression devices avert problems caused by indirect effects in cables and equipment when necessary. Every circuit and piece of equipment that is critical or essential to the safe flight and landing of an aircraft must be verified by the manufacturers to be protected against lightning in accordance with regulations set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or a similar authority in the country of the aircraft's origin.\n\nThe other main area of concern is the fuel system, where even a tiny spark could be disastrous. Engineers thus take extreme precautions to ensure that lightning currents cannot cause sparks in any portion of an aircraft's fuel system. The aircraft skin around the fuel tanks must be thick enough to withstand a burn through. All of the structural joints and fasteners must be tightly designed to prevent sparks, because lightning current passes from one section to another. Access doors, fuel filler caps and any vents must be designed and tested to withstand lightning. All the pipes and fuel lines that carry fuel to the engines, and the engines themselves, must be protected against lightning. In addition, new fuels that produce less explosive vapors are now widely used.\n\nThe aircraft's radome - the nose cone that contains radar and other flight instruments - is another area to which lightning protection engineers pay special attention. In order to function, radar cannot be contained within a conductive enclosure. Instead, lightning diverter strips applied along the outer surface of the radome protect this area. These strips can consist of solid metal bars or a series of closely spaced buttons of conductive material affixed to a plastic strip that is bonded adhesively to the radome. In many ways, diverter strips function like a lightning rod on a building."}]}
{"id": "6kxpnk", "input": "What is meant by the phrase \"Nice guys finish last\"?", "output": [{"answer": "Its a number of different factors, all of which have merit but none of which can actually justify such a huge presence. First, it is to secure trade, and thus ensure the US stays one of the wealthiest countries in the world. \n\nSecond, it allows the US to exert international pressure in situations in order to best benefit the US; it makes sense from a purely nationalistic perspective. Thirdly, it has to do with long-term investment; around WW2 the US made huge investments in its military and R & D programs in order to become competitive with the more modern militaries of Britain, France and especially Germany. \n\nLike any investment that pays off over a large number of years, it would simply be bad economics to limit or abandon it after so many years. The payback is not just in international influence but in civilian technology derived from R & D, to some extent the Space Program  &  its increasing importance in international economics; it makes money, gets jobs in the economy  &  furthers technology. \n\nHOWEVER, there are some less positive reasons why the US exhibits such a large international presence. One of the primary ones is a sense of tradition; many Americans feel (for any number of reasons, from lack of education to widespread propaganda and extremist rhetoric) that it would be simply \"un-American\" NOT to have a huge military presence. Another reason could be more psychological in nature, with the American psyche (from my experience) centering around the self (or ego), not the community or the big picture, and so its not inconceivable that that personal thought process could find its way onto the international stage and stance on foreign policy. \n\nAs such, while many politicians may feel that the military is too large (as of now representing roughly 50% of the American economy - hundreds of billions of dollars - through a lot of different sectors and whatnot) they can't really do much as the pressure exists in the voting population to have a strong military.\n\nSo yea, basically stuff.\n\nEDIT: formatting"}]}

{"id": "opyoi", "input": "how the pyramids were built, and why there are conspiracy theories about it.", "output": [{"answer": "Well the thinking behind closing the apps to save power comes from desktop OS thinking. When you run a multiple programs in windows your processor is essentially serving all of them at once which isn't a problem for a desktop but for a phone it makes the cpu work harder and thus using more power.\n\nThe reason why it wouldn't help much on an IOS device is because it uses a different method for dealing with multiple programs being open. Instead of trying to run all of them at once it essentially switches between them. One you back out of a program it creates a sort of save state that acts like a pause button for the apps. Then the cpu can ignore that program while you aren't using it and when you do want to go back it can load that save state and resume where you left off in most cases.\n\nThere are exceptions to this though like if you were streaming music from say pandora or something in which case then the cpu still has to service the app but if the app isn't actively doing something in the background it can be paused if you will which saves cpu power. This is why having a lot of apps open wont have a big effect on the battery."}]}

They can play along and make money off of it and influence it some degree where it benefits both but can't go against it. Because the reason corporate power is allowed (too strong word) to the degree it extends now is because they aid creation and maintenance of US supremacy (politically, militarily and economically). They can do things together if it benefits both but stopping spying is not on the table. \n\nIn other words, corporations are not on the top of the food chain. The mechanism that protects US and its interests is. But they are extremely interconnected so it's not a one way relationship. They are on same side in 99+% of the cases. This is a pretty rare case where national interests is actually hurting a specific business to a significant degree so they're not staying silent anymore but can't really do a whole lot either.\n\nI would also separate the idea of government as you know it (specially congress/senate) from the part of government that is in charge of maintaining US superpower position. You've seen in this whole NSA fiasco how little knowledge and control congress actually exercises over these agencies.\n\n**Devil's advocate**: It makes sense to keep these two separate to some degree because public is fairly easy to manipulate (for better or worse) and could elect a bunch of people who would undermine US supremacy by eliminating espionage programs or cutting back on military and such. And while that might be good in short term (more money for other things, less abuse of power) - 20 or 30 or 50 years down the line it could cost US a war. Because enemies don't sleep. They spy and plot just as well as US does. The Japanese were allied to US/UK after WW1 and their spies stole a ton of navy technology (carriers, aircraft, subs) from US/UK, they spied on US/UK bases, installations, manpower in SE Asia, Singapore, Pearl Harbor. So in light of such lessons learned (along with 9/11), a lot of emphasis is placed on spying on both friends and foes in order to be on top of what's going on in order to prevent another Pearl harbor, another 9/11, to prevent them from stealing military tech, etc. And these people are the ones that really write history in geopolitical sense and they don't want pesky democratic mood swings and tree hugging leaders to hurt their effort. Of course government does exercise some power over it, I may have painted a picture too one sided. But people who do (intelligence committee, president and such) either already think this way or are persuaded by advisers and people within the system and brought in on things in order to understand why it's important.\n\nThe pros and cons of such world order:\n\nPros: unipolar power structure means no large wars (as long as the superpower status is maintained) and the world is safer - the parts of history of relative peace and prosperity were those when 1 main superpower was unchallenged, nobody bothered to try to challenge them so there was no power struggle like the ones before ww1 and ww2. Other examples: Pax Romana, Pax Britannica.\n\nCons: because this superpower can't be challenged, they can use their position to do some really nasty shit (ignore international law, do stuff like iran/contra, torture people, do huge favors for businesses and undermine other countries's businesses which ultimately helps maintain supremacy, etc).\n\nBecause of human nature this is unlikely to change anytime soon. Whenever there's a power vacuum, nations try to fill it and large scale wars start. We're not yet unified enough as a species/civilization so we need something like US. But it's also kind of an abusive relationship. I think the best way to deal with this is to try to minimize the abuse of power and wait. I trust future will remove the need for such order but it won't be in our lifetime and likely not in this century either. Space exploration and tech advancements that eliminate some scarcity issues (specially energy) will help reduce the need for power struggles. We also might nuke each before we get there, who knows?"}]}

{"id": "5ezowd", "input": "Why is it that some pregancies are described as the best overall feeling a woman has ever, and for other women, the worst they have ever felt? Why is it great for some and terrible for others?", "output": [{"answer": "It's not only that it's a well maintained, low revving diesel engine (low for an automobile diesel, I mean) that does mainly long haul, it's also an economic factor. Let's say you buy a European diesel car, for let's say 35000$. If the engine doesn't blow up the first 60000 miles, then it probably won't for the next 250.000, either, proper maintenance taken for granted. \n\nHowever, you do need to exchange parts. A head gasket here, a clutch there, bunch of bearings and a water pump every now and then. Stuff starts adding up and eventually rust might also be in the picture. There comes a point where it just isn't economical anymore to fix every other thing. \n\nHowever, if you paid a quarter of a million dollars for a truck, a 5000$ repair bill doesn't look so horrible when you compare it to what a new one would cost you. \n\nAlso, you have to look at the ratio of power to displacement. A run of the mill truck will crank out about 550hp - but it also has a 16l engine. So we usually end up somewhere in the general area of about 35hp/l. A BMW 535d will shell out a whopping 300hp from just 3l. That's 100hp/l, almost three times as much. Of course, torque is more important for a truck that horsepower, but you get the picture. \nThus and because everything is wayyy bigger, you can build it a lot sturdier and quite frankly, who cares if a truck is 100lb heavier than it absolutely has to, when those extra 100lb give you an extra 200k miles."}]}
{"id": "4wqqey", "input": "Why does a new pair of glasses temporarily distort your depth perception? What causes this?", "output": [{"answer": "The effect with hot pavement is the same as the blurring that hot air causes. In fact it is hot air, that causes the reflection. The air directly above the pavement becomes really hot and when there is no wind, it will move very slowly. Thus a layer of air develops, that rises up since it's hot, but rises so slowly, that it cools down before passing the cooler layer above. It falls back down and heats up again. What you get is a more or less constantly hot layer of air, resting on the surface of the street.\n\nNow the effect that squeamish described kicks in: Two layers with different optical density meet. As a matter of fact there are multiple layers with slightly different densities, but for us the idea of two layers with a huge difference in density will do.  \nIf two materials with different optical density touch and you send light through them, things will happen. One of these things you can watch im swimming pools and fishtanks. You take a spoon and hold it into the water. It will look [broken](_URL_0_). Pull it out again and it's normal. What is happening is, that the light changes the direction of its travel. This is called refraction. In [this picture](_URL_1_) you see a ray of light changing from air (not very dense) to glass (very dense). Why this happens and how you can calculate the path it takes can very well make another ELI5.  \nThe other ray you see, that comes out is the reflected one. Whenever this transition of light happens, a part of it is reflected. Depending on the materials and the angle the light hits the surface, a different amount is reflected. This ranges from no reflection to complete reflection. To see this, point a flashlight at a window. From some spots you'll see a small reflection that is not nearly as bright as your flashlight. From one angle you will see a bright flash that makes you blink. This is the angle of total reflection.  \nAnd now we combine our results: Layers of different density create a surface that reflects light, hitting it in a specific angle. Layers of air with different temperatures have a different density. Thus the surface of the lower layer can reflect light."}]}

Isn't it just a shipwreck like the many others?", "output": [{"answer": "Bankruptcy is an option that the law gives to a person (the **debtor**) who is unable to pay their debts in time.  They go to a special court (**bankruptcy court**), to which their **creditors** (the people or companies they owe the money to) are also invited.\n\nIn bankruptcy court there will be a list of the debtor's **assets** (things they own), their **income** (how much money they earn from their job) and their **debts**.  The judge in bankruptcy court has the power to do two things:\n\n1. Take some of the debtor's assets and give them to the creditors.  (Or a different version of that is force the debtor to sell them and use the money to pay the creditors.)\n2. Modify or cancel the debts.  Modifying a debt means that the court changes either the amount that the debtor has to pay back (either the principal amount or the interest rate), or the dates by which it has to be paid back.  Canceling a debt means that the debtor will no longer have to pay it.  In both of these cases the creditor normally loses money.\n\nSo what the court is supposed to do is two things:\n\n* They need to leave the debtor in a shape that's not too bad.  This normally means allow them to keep very important assets, like the house they live in, and reduce their debt to a level that they can afford with their income.\n* They need to be fair to the creditors and try to get them as much of their money back as possible.\n\nThis means that the court will take away assets that the debtor doesn't absolutely need, and use these to pay the creditors.  If that doesn't reduce the debt to a level that the debtor can afford, then they will try to modify or cancel the debt to make it happen.\n\nWell, that's a simplified and not 100% accurate version.  One of the biggest differences is that most of the process doesn't actually happen in the courtroom.  Normally what happens is that the debtor's lawyer contacts the creditors and negotiates with them.  If everybody reaches an agreement, then they tell the bankruptcy judge that they all agreed on X, and the judge (usually) approves it.  But that's basically about saving money and time by coming to a deal without having to go through the formal process in the courtroom."}]}

You are more likely to find people close to bodies of water (genes are regulated by specific protein/dna interactions), especially where rivers meets seas (genes have start and stop codons), river deltas are usually fertile land (some regions are more likely to be coding than others), mountain ranges influences weather (DNA structure) Etc."}]}

{"id": "32gawc", "input": "Why isn't the horror genre as respected as other film genres?", "output": [{"answer": "It's not that people deliberately sought out lighter skin people because they realized it was a preferable trait. Evolution is not conscious, it *just is*.\n\nThe way it works is: there is a population of black people, which had different tones of black already there, caused by genetic mutations-- from dark brown to basically black. The attraction between males and females of that population is also random: some guys liked the lighter skinned girls, some the darker, and vice versa. They get their offspring, which has lighter or darker skin depending on their parents (combined with random genetic mutations). Important part: ALL RANDOM.\n\nPart of this population migrated to Northern Europe, where the sunlight is significantly less available. The really dark skinned people get problems with their health, because they can't get enough vitamin D. They get weaker, and are more vulnerable, susceptible to predators (wolf, bear, felines). The result is that the real dark skinned people are dying sooner than later. The lighter toned people, especially the children of lighter toned parents-- ESPECIALLY the children of the lighter toned parents who by chance have some *random* mutation that make them even lighter skinned become the healthiest of the population, because their lighter skin gives them just enough vitamin D to be healthy enough to survive-- at least as long as there are weaker specimens around, because the wolves and bears will hunt them down, and the one who falls first-- the darker skinned ones, because they're weakened-- are eaten. So the lighter skinned people even *benefit* from the fact that there are darker people around. Continue this for a hundred generations, and the lightest skinned people have survived, breeding only lighter skinned people now.\n\nThe reverse is/ was happening in Africa. Here is the same population to start with-- darker and lighter skinned people, at random-- but the lighter skinned they are, the more disadvantaged they are, because they're more susceptible to skin cancer. So here, the weaker specimens will be the lighter skinned ones, where the darker skinned ones are the most healthy.\n\nThat's what survival of the fittest is: the lighter skinned specimens were a *better fit* for Northern Europe. Nobody consciously gave them that advantage. No darker specimen thought, \"well I'd better start fucking those light bitches or my offspring will be unhealthy\"-- that's not how attraction works anyway. The traits are random, and the environmental factors decide whether certain traits are an advantage or not."}]}

{"id": "3qxy5l", "input": "If the golden rule of the stock market is to buy when low, sell when high, who is doing it the other way around?", "output": [{"answer": "There are a few reasons:\n\n(A) He came in to one of the worst financial crisis we've had as a nation in a long time. High unemployment, spiraling housing values, lack of growth in every sector...2008/2009 sucked. It was largely a byproduct of two unsustainable wars and poor planning from Bush and Congress, partially caused by deregulation in the housing market, but it was easy to pin it on Obama that early on. People think he fucked up -- either that he was the direct cause, or he botched the recovery...\n\n(B) This leads to the belief that Obama didn't do enough to fix the recession. It was a terribly slow recovery (some areas are still in recovery) -- Obama's efforts (more regulation, better rights for consumers) are not quick fixes, but they helped over the long haul.\n\n(C) GOP made it a key goal to blame Obama for every problem. All of them. Bad markets? Obama! International crisis? Obama! Government shutdown? Obama! Mr. Nappybutt, your cat, died? OBAMA!!! In some cases, there were obstructionist policies thrown directly in his path by the GOP, and Obama was blamed for not getting enough done by the people who were stopping him.\n\n(D) Obama doesn't do victory laps well. He'll put forth amazing legislation or accomplish a fantastic goal, and no one will know about it because of all the noise from the right. Screaming and yelling about how terrible Obama has been, despite the prosperity we currently have (wars mostly over, possible brokered Iran nuclear deal, stronger healthcare, better unemployment numbers, stronger housing markets, better regulations -- all under his watch). He was so focused on compromise and working together that he got thrown under the bus. A lot. It's easy to pin the blame on a black president.\n\n(E) The average racist American can't conceive of the notion that a black president didn't do a terrible job. It just doesn't add up in their tiny racist minds. He MUST have screwed up. Doesn't matter that the record mostly shows he's done pretty damn well -- not necessarily great, but not awful -- he's a godless Muslim piece of trash and he ruined our great nation with gay marriage and baby killing! Not like the great white born again Christian George W. Bush! He went and fought those Muslims personally, all while singing hymns.\n\nIn short, Obama came into a presidency with the cards stacked against him, faced constant obstruction, had a multibillion dollar PR machine against him, and had to face racist and discriminatory actions, sometimes for things that weren't even true about him. And he still has, for the most part, kicked ass. \n\nCan't complain really."}]}
{"id": "1jsye0", "input": "why do the touch screens of some mobile phones only work with the finger. They dont work with a pen or anything else. Why so?", "output": [{"answer": "Archaeology is known as a discipline that is extremely able to integrate concepts of other disciplines into their research, because they have many research questions that can be approached with those techniques and methods. For example, archaeologists can apply radiocarbon dating to find out how old organic material is, or can study dietary patterns through bone analysis.\n\nHowever, precisely because it can be such an interdisciplinary field, it is difficult for an archaeologist to be an expert in everything that is at his/her disposal. There are many archaeologists that have a general working knowledge of methods and concepts from other disciplines, and there are some that are specialised in a single other discipline (we then proceed to call them specialists, such as osteoarchaeologists for people that are specialised in analysing bone material, or landscape archaeologists/geoarchaeologists for people that are specialised in physical geography in the context of archaeology). Sometimes even people that have no affinity with archaeology are involved if the people working on a project have limited or no knowledge of the methods/concepts they need to use.\n\nMore complex archaeological research is thus rarely conducted by a single person. Often there is a team of people involved, some of whom may be general archaeologists, some of whom may be more specialised archaeologists, and some may be trained in different fields entirely, depending on the kind of material that they are working on and the kind of research questions that are asked."}]}

People with philosophy major/minors would be better suited to describe the more complex parts of the human for this one. However here is my 2 cents.   \n\n\nAs someone who is a compulsive liar it stemmed from childhood. Often I would get in far more trouble for telling the truth then I would for lying. Both long-run and immediate. Like many habits lying produces dopamine, causing me to feel rewarded for lying. However, guilt usually follows after. It's hard to break this habit as it makes me feel safe and incontrol of the situation while very rarely resulting in a bad outcome.  \n\n\nAnother part stems from our flight or fight response. Lying is the flight response kicking in.  Humans are very much animals when it comes to our instincts - we don't want to put ourselves in the way of harm. We view social situations in a lot of the same ways as we view danger and will act differently depending on the level of stress. Lying is a sense of control and lets us not be vulnerable."}]}

{"id": "4hc346", "input": "What about touching grass with your bare skin makes it so itchy?", "output": [{"answer": "Reposting an old comment of mine:\n\nIt all started in 1890 with the birth of Zionism, the belief that Jews deserve a homeland, by Theodor Herzl.\n\nHerzl started to work towards that goal. The the rise of Zionism along with economical problems in Europe and persecution in Eastern Europe led to the 1st Alyiah, which was a mass immigration of 35K Jews into Palestine over the course of 20 years. The rise of Zionism along with the mass migrations eventually led to the Balfour Declaration which to make it short, approved and showed support for the construction of a Jewish state in Palestine, which was inhabited by Arabs, small Jewish colonies, and controlled by England after the Ottoman Empire lost control over the zone after WWI.\n\nAs the years passed, Jewish immigration continued and Jewish socialist colonies in Palestine started rising, called Kibbutz's, and eventually also modern cities started to be built. Such development started to worry the Arab locals, and that led to attacks on Jewish inhabitants. Because of the rising immigration the British ended up imposing regulations on the amount of Jews that could immigrate to Palestine. The attacks on Jews along with the limits on the immigration led to the formation of Jewish paramilitary groups such as the Haganah which was in charge of the defense over Jews, the terrorist organization Irgun, and other organizations that were in charge of smuggling Jews into Palestine, and even attacking Brits in order to get them out of Palestine and gain independence.\n\nEventually the tensions were too big and the British started looking for solutions, and that led to the Partition Plan. There is much debate about the fairness of the plan towards Jews and Arabs but to make it short, the plan would divide Palestine into two states. A Palestinian state, and a Jewish state, with some zones not belonging to any side and being controlled by the UN.\n\nThe Jews accepted the plan, but the Arabs refused it and started more riots. Eventually, the British decided to GTFO. One day before the Brits left, the Jews declared their independence and called their state Israel. When the British left, different Arab armies invaded Israel with the intention of killing their inhabitants. This is were things start to get messy. There are some versions. One version says that the Palestinians left because the neighboring countries asked them to leave during the war in order to not get caught in the crossfire between the Jews and the Arab armies. The other version says that there was a planned ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians by the Jews and that they were expelled. I believe that it was a combination of both. There are testimonies of the Palestinians leaving on their own, and there are testimonies of Palestinian villages being massacred.\n\nThe war ended, and to the surprise of their neighbors, the Jews won. By the end of the war, there were around 900 thousand Palestinian refugees with no country willing to absorb them. They were left by Egypt in what today is the Gaza Strip, and by Jordan in what today is the West Bank. Over the years, Israel was attacked again, and again Israel was the victorious one gaining more land. I think that it was after the Six Days war in the '67, that Israel conquered the Sinai from Egypt. Some years later, Israel gave back the Sinai, but stayed with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. So ever since the '67, Israel is in charge of the refugees. Since Israel's creation, the refugees dream with a state of their own, but resort to violence and attacks on Israeli citizens, which worsen their situation.\n\nThis creates a big problem. The Israelis tried many times to make peace with the Palestinians, but the Palestinians were stabbed in the back by Yasser Arafat, their leader over the past decades until his death, which refused for any kind of peace. With the flow of time, Israel started growing settlements in Palestinian areas in order to maintain control over the Palestinian areas.\n\nSo now we have a huge problem. The Palestinians demand that we go back to the '67 borders simply to start serious negotiations. That implies for us to displace 400 thousand settlers. Nobody is going to do that. In the meanwhile, the Palestinians are led by fanatical fundamentalists that want us dead more more than they want the Palestinians alive. We on the other side, are led by people that find maintaining the status quo more appealing than displacing so much settlers. The only man who had the courage to make what had to be done was Ariel Sharon, who pulled all the settlers out of Gaza. Sadly, that killed his political career. Moreover, the short term effects of the Gaza disengagement were so disastrous, that they killed any close possibility of getting out of the West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, we Israelis get more and more frustrated with our peace attempts, and start turning to fascist leaders such as Avigdor Lieberman who calls for the expulsion of Israeli Arabs. That as a consequence, turn the Palestinians even more against us and start being brainwashed, which makes us turn into even more fascist leaders. So now we are on 2010, controlling the borders of Gaza and blockading it as a failed attempt to make the Palestinians understand that they only harm themselves with every rocket they shoot at us, and maintaining a military occupation over the West Bank, with fascist parties gaining power. The sittuation is at the shitter and all I can hope for, is for the future Israeli and Palestinian generations to understand that their leaders are not interested in peace and that it's up to them to solve what their grandfathers did.\n\nThese are the views of a 21 years old Argentinian who lived between the age of 12 and 18 in Israel. I hope that you find it helpful."}]}

Both types of engine pull air towards them (~half the speed change in air due to the presence of a propellor happens before the air reaches the propellor itself).\n\nBecause it has walls and lots of blades, the jet engine can sustain high pressures through much more of the engine. With a prop, the pressure differences can only be sustained over part of the blade and slowly fades towards zero at the tip because air spills over to the lower pressure areas.\n\nThis large pressure helps drive a faster speed of air out the back of the engine which gives more thrust and also gives thrust up to a higher speed (you cant fly faster forward than the air comes out the back of the engine because you need the momentum to balance.\n\nThere is also a trade off between how much air you put through the engine and how fast you push it out, one with give higher max speeds but the other will give more thrust and efficiency at low speeds which is why you get turboprops with huge propellor blades, much bigger than any jet engine"}]}

{"id": "45vb4g", "input": "Why is marijuana \"impossible\" to overdose on?", "output": [{"answer": "From my understanding:\n\nThe virus was one of the first to adapt to its environment.  It started off being infected on one of the workers USB drives left in their car.  When that person plugged the USB drive in to the facility's computer, then it would know to move to the new host.  What's remarkable about this computer virus is that it knew exactly what its target was.  It would figure out what type of machine it was on, and then determine the best way to move on up the chain of computers until it finally reached its target.  In this case, the target was a Siemen's micro controller for Uranium enrichment centrifuges.  Once the virus had infected the firmware of the microcontroller, it could do whatever it wanted with it.  The virus would speed the centrifuges up way beyond their operating limits, causing them to break, and then delete the system logs of this happening.  By deleting the logs, the plant engineers had no idea why the centrifuges were breaking, on top of it was very difficult to catch it in the act.  The purpose was to delay the plant's production for as long as possible.  I believe this went on for at least a year and eventually the director was fired because things were taking so long.    Another thing of importance was that Stuxnet used around four zero-day attacks.  A zero-day attack is an exploit that nobody else knows about, so it will be a complete surprise.  You can only use such an attack once since they are fixed ASAP once revealed.\n\nDue to the complexity of its creation, it has to have been created by a nation.  It was written in a combination of languages, including some very low level assembly code.  The knowledge of the zero-day attacks and Siemen's architecture raises some flags too.  IIRC it was digitally signed which means that it looked like a legitimate program to the infected computer.  I would think that such sabotage could be considered an act of war, especially when you look at the damage it caused the reactor.  Stuxnet showed how vulnerable some computer controlled equipment are, and I'm sure there will be many more incidents like this popping up in the future."}]}

Moving towards warmth means that rather than lying on the ground, where they're unlikely to be picked up by an animal, they crawl to the top of grass, where the warmth of the sun is greater - and where they're more likely to get picked up by an animal.\n\nOnce they're on an animal, they start to burrow towards the source of carbon dioxide - the mammal's skin, which is constantly emitting carbon dioxide.  There, the scent is very strong, and the tick bites and starts to feed.\n\nThese are all hard-wired into the tick's brain.  The \"warmth sensing\" brain circuitry feeds directly into the \"movement\" brain circuitry.\n\nThese are simple examples, but the kind of provide a template for more complex examples.  Mammals have a hard-wired desire to stay close to their mother when very young, to seek out and suck on nipples, to flee from loud sounds."}]}

They're smart, hardworking, thrifty, enterprising.  They tend to be wealthy.  They value education.  They have high levels of family discipline (i.e. they never just have babies).  They always take care of their children.  They don't commit violent crimes.  Chua tried to explain why these smart, hardworking, educated, thrifty, enterprising,rich, family oriented people tend to be disliked by the majority ethnic group they reside among.  She states that the main reason is that these minorities eventually rise to the top echelons of the societies in which they live and then use their superior power and wealth to act in their own ethnic interest and often against the national interest.  They just aren't good guardians of the society as a whole.  \n\nI think she goes into the Jewish control of the media in Russia and how Russian politicians tried to fight it by exerting state control over the media.  Again, the minority has enormous power (control of the media; control over the terms of debate) but its interests are different from that of the society as a whole.     \n\nBy the way, all of these minorities, in spite of the fact that they are usually well off, are known as big tax cheats.  (\"It was widely known that these [Lebanese] plutocrats paid no taxes and lived opulent lives...\")  They're also not known for being good employers.  I don't think anyone would want to work for these people.  (\"Throughout Southeast Asia, many Chinese-controlled firms routinely violate tax laws, banking and lending laws, and laws concerning overtime regulations and worker safety.\")  \n\nChua also implies that the dumber, lazier majority is jealous of the minority group's success.  She mentions in passing that members of the minority tend to be contemptuous of the majority and live in their own gated communities (but given that the minority is so much more successful, can you really blame them)?\n\nChua herself is a member of a middleman minority group so maybe she doesn't have a good understanding of how they come across to other people.  Middleman minorities tend to be dishonest.  Yes, they're hardworking, but they cheat a lot as well.  They can also be very brusque and rude.  I think being a middleman minority selects for just really bad personalities.  \n\nI did a search in her book for \"dishonest,\" \"brusque,\" and \"rude.\"  There was one hit for \"dishonest\" but it wasn't meaningful.  I also searched for \"corrupt\" and \"corruption,\" and here she talks about how Indians in Africa have made money through various dishonest schemes.  But usually, the term is used to describe politicians and the government, not the minorities themselves.  I also did a search for \"prostitution\" \"pornography\" \"sexuality\" but nothing.   \n\nIn sum, no one likes middleman minorities.  They're rude and dishonest.  They don't really \"give back\" to the society in which they live (e.g. paying taxes)."}]}

Diplomacy is really hard to do with North Korea, they are difficult to communicate and make deals with. Compounded with that any discussion about them in the UN Security Council is instantly veto'ed by Russia and China, NK's closest allies (China is starting to get sick of their shit though).\n\n2. They have the capability to fire missiles at nearby targets like South Korea and Japan, with a known nuclear capability (even if it is weak). So a military solution of just invading them and liberating its people isn't an option given the possible nuclear retaliation.\n\n3. Even if that weren't the case, invading NK unprovoked without more reasoning than human rights violations sets a dangerous precedent of \"Might equals Right\", where the most powerful countries can do whatever they want if they have any excuse. Any country that tried to do so would receive a lot of international backlash (best example, Crimea and the trade sanctions Russia has gotten for it).\n\n4. If you did liberate the North Korean people, then what? The question of who is responsible for the land, infrastructure and people of the former North Korea is a big one. Whatever country takes it (probably South Korea) is going too heavily suffer economically supporting a large uneducated (and probably hostile given the propaganda) population and upgrading a small countries worth of everything where technological innovation stopped in the 1960's. So even if the NK Government just dissolved itself and gave up control and rights to the country to whoever would take it, it would be an expensive problem no one really wants too take on.\n\n\nSo all in all, the only real hope for a timely solution is that NK's people rebel/military coup and manage to overthrow the current government to set up a west friendly democracy or the nation just collapses on itself economically. A diplomatic solution may be possible in 100 years, but that's not all too helpful."}]}

Note, though, that no result concerning gravity is especially precise.\n\nOther planets in our solar system are massed by the second means. Actually, we explain how a property (such as gravitational acceleration) behaves as a function of mass, then we take the ratio of the property on that planet with that on Earth; we can then express the planet's mass as a fraction or multiple of Earth's.\n\nFor objects in other solar systems, we use the first method when seeing how much a star wobbles as a body orbits around it. This is actually how we discover some exoplanets and gain insight about what they are (usually, they are gas giants because it is hard to detect anything else, but we are getting better now).\n\nOne can also get an estimate for the mass by just knowing the materials of which the planet is composed (and their relative fractions), knowing their densities, and then multiplying the volume of the planet by those densities and adding. Often, though, this process is reversed in order to check a theory or to figure out what the composition of an object is (especially beneath its surface).\n\nStars are massed similarly or one can watch how much their gravitation bends the light from the stars behind them (such as during an eclipse)."}]}

In an expanding Universe this distance NOW is larger than the speed of light times the light travel time due to the increase of separations between objects as the Universe expands. This is not due to any change in the units of space and time, but just caused by things being farther apart now than they used to be.\n\nWhat is the distance NOW to the most distant thing we can see? Let's take the age of the Universe to be 14 billion years. In that time light travels 14 billion light years, and some people stop here. But the distance has grown since the light traveled. The average time when the light was traveling was 7 billion years ago. For the critical density case, the scale factor for the Universe goes like the 2/3 power of the time since the Big Bang, so the Universe has grown by a factor of 22/3 = 1.59 since the midpoint of the light's trip. But the size of the Universe changes continuously, so we should divide the light's trip into short intervals. First take two intervals: 7 billion years at an average time 10.5 billion years after the Big Bang, which gives 7 billion light years that have grown by a factor of 1/(0.75)2/3 = 1.21, plus another 7 billion light years at an average time 3.5 billion years after the Big Bang, which has grown by a factor of 42/3 = 2.52. Thus with 1 interval we got 1.59*14 = 22.3 billion light years, while with two intervals we get 7*(1.21+2.52) = 26.1 billion light years. With 8192 intervals we get 41 billion light years.

{"id": "7vpx1b", "input": "Why are some round, flat things called \"disks\" while other round flat things are \"discs\"?", "output": [{"answer": "There are several ways.\n\nThe first is by parallax. We can measure the position of an object during the summer and compare it to its position during the winter. We know the distance between our two measuring points (twice the distance from Earth to the Sun), and can use that and the two angles to calculate the distance to the object. It works best with things that are relatively close, since the difference in angles is smaller the farther away an object is.\n\nAnother is by using \"standard candles.\" A lot of astronomical events have a known brightness. A Type Ia supernova always has the same brightness, for example. And we know that apparent brightness drops at a specific rate based on distance. So when a supernova is observed, we can compare the known brightness to the apparent brightness, plug it into the equation, and figure out the distance.\n\nWe also see patterns in the life cycle of a star, and can make a good guess as to its actual brightness based on where in its life cycle the star is. Again, we can compare this with its apparent brightness to calculate its approximate distance.\n\nThere are a bunch of other methods, but these are the most common. Astronomers often use multiple methods to calculate the same distance, in order to be as accurate as possible."}]}

The more diverse you are, the better chance *someone* or some subgroup will be sufficiently equipped to handle it.\n\nIn a world without significant selection pressure, arguing that genetic diversity is unequivocally good may not automatically be true.  You certainly want to have a diverse enough population group that recessive genes don't get paired up often, (avoid family up to first or second cousins) but beyond that it may not make much of a difference.  Human kind has descended from bottle-necked populations before.  At plenty of times in our history the number of humans alive has been under a million.

But if we start with imperative programming you're basically just writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow in order one by one.\n\nIn imperative programming one will end up writing the same instructions over and over every time they need to do common tasks, like read or write to a file or draw an image on the screen.\n\nA way to reuse code was needed. So procedures that you can call over and over are used. Basically a procedure is like a tiny micro program that just does one thing like a draw_image procedure.\n\nBut then programs got so big that they needed to organize all their procedures into modules or libraries. So all your image functions would be in an image module for example with all the image_ functions inside it. Then you could include all the different modules your program needed to run.\n\nBut in procedural programming code and data are separate. A program might call the image_load procedure to load image data from a file then pass that data to the image_draw procedure to draw it on the screen and then the image_save procedure to save the changes to the file.\n\nSo, the modules and procedures themselves are reusable but you still have to write code to pass the data back and forth to the different modules. The program basically becomes a data shuffler that passes data back and forth between different procedures.\n\nSo, to try to make code even more reusable they came up with OOP which is basically a way to write tiny programs or \"objects\".\n\nObjects are basically modules but the difference between a module and an object is an object manages its own data. Not only are the procedures that work with image data inside the image object, but the image data is also. Any time you need a new image, you create a new image object inside the application.\n\nSo your overall application is made up of many tiny programs or \"objects\" that talk to each other by passing messages to each other and tell each other what to do.\n\n\nWhile at heart this is just a higher level of abstraction, it allows for many more advanced concepts that would be hard to do in a procedural style. Like encapsulation and information hiding. Now the programmer can do things like restrict other parts of the program from accessing data inside their object and messing it up. But like I said OOP is more than one concept. It's a few different concepts built on top of each other.\n\nHow OOP is achieved is completely different in different programming languages though so it's hard to give a good example from here on out without referencing a specific language."}]}

A coalition is a group of alliances that band together. There are also 3-4 other smaller coalitions (Russian Bloc, N3), as well as some independent notable alliances (Black Legion in this case).\n\nThese are all Nullsec powers. The HBC's core alliance is TEST; an alliance that is based from and recruits out of your favorite website, Reddit (Shameless plug: go to /r/evedreddit to check out Reddit's corporation/alliance.  The CFC's core alliance is Goonswarm, which is based in and recruits out of your least favorite website, SomethingAwful!\n\nNow, it would appear that these two alliances were born to be rivals, but it was not always this way. When the reddit corporation (alliances are composed over individual corporations) first joined EVE, they were attacked by the SA corporation, goonswarm; who were already very established in the EVE universe. Instead of becoming enemies, the Goons were taken aback by the adorableness of our attitude towards the game, and we became allies and soon to be best friends. They nurtured us, tought us, fought for us. Our current leader, Montolio, decided that he wanted to take a path of independence.\n\nWe met another group of players in an alliance called Pandemic Legion. They are considered the big bad guys of EVE. They posses hundreds of the Super Carriers and Titans; the most powerful ships in the game and which the pictures in the OP are mostly comprised of. Basically, these guys have a public mumble channel called OG mumble. Mumble is a program like teamspeak, if you didn't know. This was when Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was popular, and some of our guys joined their channel to play with them. They befriended them, and more people joined to play and more and more. Soon, their EVE alliance had invited us to go on campaign with them; and it was hella fun. They were a bunch of old players, and our raw enthusiasm of the game seemed to make it more fun for them, and their wealth, power and experience taught us a lot.\n\nThe problem is, that our new PL friends are direct enemies with our Goonswarm bros. These tensions were drawn down, and we eventually got both of them fighting for us to attack a new threat to us in the South. But that's another story.\n\nWhat's important to last night is that we chose to go with PL instead of goons, and we formed our own coalition; the HBC. Between PL's ability to drop many of the most powerful ships in the game, and our ability to rush in with hundreds of support ships to back them up, it's a potent force.\n\nLast night, a relatively small pirate alliance that controls a good bit of territory nearby Goon-land thought that the goons may try to attack them over a local moon; which holds mineral resources. They informed a fleet commander in Pandemic Legion that this may be happening, and PL set up to ambush goons.\n\nThe goonswarm Fleet commander (FC), Dabigredboat, is a prettty interesting character, who is loved or hated throughout the game, but that's another story. Anyways, he is flying a titan. These are the most powerful ships in the game, they do a lot of damage, can take a LOT of damage, and are ridiculously expensive. Additionally, they can move across the universe rapidly with a jump drive; but they can also move OTHER SHIPS across the universe rapidly by \"bridging\" them.\n\nSidebar: EVE has an interesting feature where people can buy game time cards (30/60 day) and sell them in game for in game money; allowing wealthy people to essentially play the game for free, and allowing people who are wealthy out of game to have the money to do what they want. This provides a rare insight to the actual value of in game item. And a titan, like dabigredboat's, would cost something like $3500 dollars to buy with out of game money.\n\nBack to the story. So basically, boat is in his titan getting ready to bridge a full fleet (~250 dudes) onto this small pirate alliance. Except he makes a mistake; he clicks JUMP instead of BRIDGE. That sends his $3,500 ship right into the middle of this pirate corporation with nobody nearby to support him. And then all hell breaks loose.\n\nIf you'll remember, PL was aware that something might be going down, and when the pirates inform them that a titan has jumped in, and not only a titan but Dabigredboat's titan, they jump in 3-4 supercarriers. Supercarriers do more damage than a titan, but don't take quite as much and aren't quite as expensive. Boat orders Goon and CFC supers to log in, and they drop a few more supers in to help boat. PL goes into hyperdrive and goes all in; they drop every supercarrier they have available, and are frantically calling everyone they know to get there as well.\n\nAnd then Boat makes a crucial mistake. He should have realized that his titan and the few supers he called in to support him were going to die, and cut his losses. But instead he panics, and calls in EVERYTHING the CFC has to help get him out of there. At this point, the battle transcends hell and goes into every god damn layer of Dante's Inferno. The CFC commits every supercarrier, titan, dreadnought (basically floating gun platforms that do a ton of damage) and regular carrier (which are basically \"healers\") that they can. PL does the same, and the rest of the HBC is in right behind them. My fleet, and the rest of the TEST fleet burned across the universe at best speed to get into the fight, and all of our capitals (dreads/carriers) and supercapitals jumped in ahead of us.\n\nAlso, goons are not well liked in the universe of EVE. They have fought against (and won against) pretty much every major player in the game. So the rest of the smaller coalitions also jump into the fray. And even though we're technically \"unfriendly\", they join ourside and the whole universe of EVE piles onto the CFC. My poor laptop crashed when there were 2800 people in the solar system (And there were hundreds more in surrounding systems), but it was epic.\n\nThe CFC lost a lot of shit. ~44 Dreads, 29 Carriers, 5 Supercarriers and 3 Titans. The HBC and the rest of EVE lost 10 Carriers, 6 Dreads, and one Supercarrier. It's a mind boggling amount of damage done, and money lost. But that's EVE."}]}

{"id": "215cg8", "input": "Why are they still looking for debris from Malaysia Airlines MH370?", "output": [{"answer": "So the main reason people may believe this actually comes from some fairly robust reasoning to do with Black Holes. I'll go step by step.\n\nThe entropy of a bunch of stuff is pretty easy to understand. Roughly, it's the number of ways the stuff could be arranged microscopically, that give rise to the same properties of the stuff macroscopically. It's useful for describing things like gases, where a microscopic state is one set of positions of the molecules that make up the gas, and the macroscopic state is the temperature, pressure and volume of the gas. You can also think of the entropy as telling you how much information you'd have to give to specify a particular microscopic arrangement, and so entropy is essentially the information content of the system. \n\nSo, What happens if I throw my gas in a Black Hole? In particular, what happens to the entropy? The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy increases, but if I throw stuff into a Black Hole, and the gas disappears, then no more gas means no more entropy. In order to keep the second law of thermodynamics alive, you've got to say that a Black Hole has entropy. \n\nSince we asked that the Black Hole help us obey the second law of thermodynamics, we should also ask that it obey something like the first law of thermodynamics. Really it's a little more complicated and rigorous but the upshot is that we find that the entropy is related to the area of the Black Hole's horizon, S~A. \n\nSo what we should do then is say that the amount of information inside the Black Hole, can be found by measuring its surface area. In other words, everything that's happening inside the Black Hole all of that data, has to be contained on the horizon of the hole. We have a holographic statement, that the physics inside the Black Hole should be described by some physics on the event horizon. \n\nIt's then a short jump to say that if it's true for a Black Hole, objects which have the maximum possible entropy, because they've got the maximum amount of stuff in them, then it should be true for everything else too. That given a region of space, we should be able to draw a big shape around it, and figure out everything about the inside of the shape just by examining the boundary. \n\nTheoretical physicists have pursued this much further and found concrete examples of something known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a theory exactly of this type. With gravity in the volume, and a special quantum field theory describing exactly the same physics, but in one less dimension, and located on the boundary of the space. \n\nI've seen some mumbo jumbo associated with the idea in the popular science literature, but the science and mathematics is really there, it's really real, and there are good reasons for believing that the universe is a hologram.  \n\nTL;DR: The entropy of something tells us how much info there is inside it. Black Holes are maximum entropy objects, and so contain maximum information. A Black Holes entropy is proportional to it's surface area, not it's volume. So the information a Black Hole contains can be though of as living on it's surface. So a Black Hole is like a hologram. If Black Holes are described like holograms, then we are too!"}]}

{"id": "5qhpq7", "input": "What atomic properties determine the transparency of a material?", "output": [{"answer": "There are roughly two schools of thought in AI:\n\nThe original school (symbolism), attempts to teach computers to solve problems logically. This is a relatively efficient use of computer power to solve high levels problems, from diagnosing a disease (expert system) to interpreting a sentence. Logic problems are expressed by symbols and solved step by step, which is what computers are good at. Logic problems can be proven to be solvable by a Turing machine and the CPU + memory model is based on the Turing machine.\n\nThe other school (connectionism) uses computer models of neurons to model the brain. Simulating many individual neurons and the connections is not efficient for a normal CPU. The initial successes of this approach were therefore limited to very low level pattern recognition tasks, like character recognition or object avoidance. Simulating a single function of the brain of an insect was already a huge challenge.\n\nImprovements in hardware (eg GPUs) and network learning techniques (deep learning) have brought these fields closer together. Neural networks can now be constructed and trained hierarchically.

This could lead to claims that the corporation is biased and lead to lawsuites.

Causes of death in non-particular order:\n\n* Infection (very common)\n   * Chemotherapy weakens your immune system. About 5-10 days (it depends though) after having chemo, the bone marrow might stop producing white blood cells, which fight infections that in a normal person would be taken care of  by the immune system. Signs of infection while receiving chemo is a medical emergency, and requires treatment with antibiotics.\n   * Cancer patients are often old. Old people are in general more prone to get infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Cancer increases the risk.\n   * Many cancer patients feel weak and rest a lot. Bed rest weakens the the muscles that help ventilate the lungs. It's harder to cough up mucus. this can cause pneumonia.\n* Blod clots\n   * Having cancer in itself makes the blod clot more easily. Many drugs used to treat cancer also increase the risk of clots. Lying in bed a lot makes the blood flow slower (stasis) and pool in the legs, making the blod thicker and clot. These clots can travel to the lungs. If these clots are big enough, they can block the blood flow to the lungs and can cause lung failure.\n   * Clots in the lungs makes it harder for the blood to pump blood in to the lungs, because the lungs are clogged up. This can cause heart failure.\n* Organ failure. \n   * Many cancers spread to the liver or the liver. A liver does many things that are vital for the body to function (make proteins and hormones, break down waste++). \n   * Kidney: The kidneys do many things, for instance the make you pee out toxins and balance out the sodium, potassium ++(electrolytes) that the cells need to have perfectly balanced. Cancer drugs can be toxic for the kidneys.\n   * Lung failure. Lung cancer or cancer that spread to the lungs can make the lungs not take up oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The cells in the body need oxygen to function. If they dont get oxygen, they break down and leak potassium. Potassium can cause the heart to beat abnormally.\n   * Brain. The skull does not permit the brain to grow. If the brain grows due to cancer, it causes the brain to try to escape downwards to the spinal cord. This squeezes the lowest part in the brain where the breathing centre is located. This makes you immediately stop breathing. \n* Starvation. \n   * Cancer cells divide rapidly and use a lot of energy. They steal this energy from the rest of the body. This makes you very thin (cachexia). Once you are very thin and have no sugar and fat in your body, the whole body chemistry is distorted. The cells die due to lack of energy and start to leak. The amount of acid in the body increases. The heart can't beat. The liver can't break down waste products. The kidneys can't remove the waste. Everything breaks down."}]}

A debt *settlement* would be, if you went to Discover and said, 'I only have $3,000 and I'll give it all to you, if you agree to forget the rest of the balance I owe to you'.  If Discover agreed to that offer and you paid the $3,000, then you would have *settled* the $6,000 debt.\n\nBut let's say you can't do that.  Let's say Discover rejected your offer and said 'No, you agreed to a minimum payment of $200 a month, and that's what we expect'.  Let's say you offered American Express and Mastercard a similar offer and they too rejected your *settlement* insisting upon the minimum monthly payment of $200.  You could go to a fourth company and agree that they will pay your debts with Mastercard, Discover, and American Express and in returned you will pay them $100 a month until the original $18,000 from the three credit cards, plus what fees and interest they add to the $18,000.  You would have *consolidated* the debt with the fourth company.\n\n**Settling**-the difficulty with settling a debt is that Visa needs a pretty good reason to forget the $3,000 dollars they shelled out for you.  From their point of view, you not only owe $6,000 now, but maybe an additional $2,000 in interest two years from now.  And in the meantime, they will motivate you to pay by informing other lenders that you owe them money via a your credit report.  \n\n**Consolidation**- the problem with consolidating debt is that it's not cheap.  A company would only shell out $18,000 if there was something in it for them.  By the way they will try to settle the amount with Visa, Mastercard and Discover for 3,000 each.  So they will gladly pay off or settle the $18,000 in return for $100 dollars a month for a couple decades.\n\nMy advise is to offer a settlement.  Worst case scenario your in the same boat you u are in now.  And even if they don't accept your offer, they might counter your offer, in which case you would still be saving money.  The only problem is getting the funds for the settlement.  If they reject this, try to work out a new repayment plan on your own.  If they refuse or if the interest and fees aren't acceptable, don't go to a consolidation company.  Talk to a lawyer, they could probably get you a better deal at a better price than a consolidation company."}]}

You will notice that the architecture of the time (Baroque) was also deliberately ornate, curvy and \"exotic\" compared to previous, more austere design and colour preferences - and those preferences were partly dictated by what was technologically possible and affordable (going further back, the invention of the flying buttress and with it the whole gothic cathedral made large, colourful windows possible, whereas previously, tall walls had to be thick to support their own weight and didn't allow large windows. Clothes and anything else that humans like to be pretty would be under similar \"technological\" constraints.)\n\nBill Bryson covers historical changes in fashion in his awesome book [At Home - A Short History of Private Life](_URL_0_) and notes that only in the 19th century did something like a \"butler's uniform\" become common because by that time, the Industrial Revolution had made good fabrics available to everyone and the rich needed some other way to distinguish servants from themselves.

As a result, they will never have a finite or repeating \"tail\", no matter what base you choose. This is a fundamental property of irrational numbers. Some of the rational numbers, on the other hand, can become \"neater\" in right bases, at the expense of those rationals that are \"neat\" in base 10 becoming \"less neat\" in other bases. For example, 0.(3) in base 10 is just 0.1 (with no repeating part) in base 3, but 0.1 in base 10 is a periodic number in base 3.\n\nSpeaking of history, no one knows for sure, but there is a popular opinion that 10 indeed comes from the number of fingers we have. At the same time, one of the most other well-known bases is base 60 that Babylonians used. We still have the legacy of it in counting angles and time (and some things in the imperial system of units btw). Note how often it's a source of a huge headache when you need to calculate time difference or something else like that. An argument could be made that it would be easier for humankind if we counted everything in one base, no matter which one it is, instead of using base 10 for most things and base 60 for *some* things.

If you expect 6-year-olds to get 60/100 on it, then 60/100 is your standard for 6-year-olds.\n\nSo let's say an 8-year-old comes in and gets 60 on your test. You would say they have a \"chronological age\" of 8, and a \"mental age\" of 6, suggesting they're behind their peers. This is all mental age ever meant--it was used to identify students who were intellectually delayed. Now, we treat these topics with more sophistication than a singular statistic--we break intelligence down into many different subcategories to identify where someone might be lacking."}]}

If you imagine a water pipe, imagine the water flowing through the pipe in a single direction (Either left to right etc). A battery is probably one of the most common DC power supplies, meaning that DC is typically used in most low voltage things around your house. In mathmatical terms, DC can be explained by Ohm's law (Voltage = current x resistance). \n\nAlternating current, is as the name suggests is where the flow of electrons changes direction. The power supplied to your home is AC (sine wave), because it is the most cost effective way to deliver it, meaning that it is easy to generate and cheap to produce. In AC the current and voltage constantly change direction, this is what is known as hertz, 50/60 hz means that the current and voltage will change direction 50/60 times per second."}]}

This air is fed through a small nozzle in the middle of a tube to make a vortex (a swirling pattern of air).

The particulates hit the tube wall, and fall out of the airstream to the bottom, where the tubes dump into the collection bin.\n\nThe particulate has to have enough mass to make the system work, which is why cyclonic vacuum cleaner instruction manuals will warn you that you cannot use the vacuum cleaner to suck up fine dust and things like that.

WCS (canadian sweet crude) often trades at a spread to WTI (sweet cushing) and settles in canadian dollars which is its price in US either converted to CAD using the bank of Canada noon day rate average or the noon day rate month average.  (This also avoids the bips the banks charge to convert).\n\n\nThe distinction between trading in and settling in also puts only one currency arbitrage.  That's one of the reasons why it trades in one currency vs many.  (If it was subject to many currency arbitrages, it would then basically become a currency itself.). \n\nThe idea behind using USD as the currency is that the U.S. Economy and volume of currency can handle the volatility of crude trading without impacting the currency  itself.    The other currencies that have the stability needed would be the pound or the euro.   The pound probably can't handle the volume of crude traded,  the euro probably could.\n\nThe other thing to consider is the position in the market. (long or short). Both in the prompt (current trading cycle) or future.   And this affect on demand of currency.    But in general for every drop of crude sold there is a buyer and the money doesn't exit the market.   (But it has before as well as the opposite).  Thus you just need a currency that can handle the volume without it deflating the economy.  The USD achieves that which is why it is used.\n\n\nWhat I don't think people realize is how dependent you are on crude oil.  It touches everything in your life to the clothes you wear to the food you eat.   Crude oil is the worlds drug.  I write this so you understand the sheer amount of volume being traded."}]}

{"id": "48gd6m", "input": "Are judges forced to accept legal precedents or can they ignore and decide by themselves", "output": [{"answer": "Computer programs are usually made up of many different components all working together, and interfacing with other parts of the system. For example, a media player will ask the Operating System to deal with things like opening and reading files, creating a graphical window or handling input events from the user; at the same time, it might ask other software components called codecs to decode video and audio, which it then passes to other components which interact with the sound system and video drivers and so on.\n\nThe public face of a software component is called an API, or Application Programming Interface.\n\nThe Operating System provides many programming interfaces to allow software to access the services it provides, such as controlling hardware, accessing the file system, interacting with user input devices, managing memory and other resources and so on. Similarly, there are many shared *libraries* of software that can be used by other software components (these are the .dll files you'll find in your System directories) and these libraries also provide programming interfaces. You can think of the API as as the contract that tells other software what exactly the component provides and how it should be used. The internals of the component are free to change, but it can still be used by software the same way as long as the public facing contract remains the same. In this way, libraries can be updated without having to update all the software that uses them. It's also what allows programs to run on multiple different version of Windows, for example.\n\nSo what does an API *look like*? Well, it depends on the programming languages and systems that it's been designed to work with. There are *Web* APIs which allow systems on the Internet to communicate (e.g. Reddit has an API, as does Facebook), but the simplest and most common type of interface is for software components on the same computer, and these are exported as a set of C functions. C is a very common and relatively simple programming languages which most others are compatible with, making it a good choice. Functions are the pieces of functionality that are provided.\n\nAn example of an API function provided by the Windows Operating System is the `GetVersion` function, which looks like this:\n\n    DWORD WINAPI GetVersion(void);\n\nThis means there is a Windows API function called *GetVersion* which takes no parameters (void) and returns a 32-bit double word containing the Operating System version. The Windows Operating System provides literally *thousands* of API functions, as do most Operating Systems."}]}

The phenomenon resulting from exceeding the local speed of light is known as Cherenkov radiation, and is the cause of the blue glow in nuclear power stations. The speed of light in water is lower than that in air, so particles enter water at a speed higher than the local speed of light. The excess energy is dumped as photons, and may be any colour or even X-rays or gamma rays if the particle's initial speed is high enough. \n\nAny object exceeding the local speed of light is therefore a light-emitting object. Its *apparent* colour is affected by the Doppler effect, but there is no 'shockwave' as such because light can't be caught up with even by its emitter. Therefore the frequency appears to change. Standing in front of the object you would observe bluer light being emitted, while behind it you would observe redder light. \n\nThis is also how we tell how far away other stars are, and how fast they are moving."}]}

Impromptu meetings, team updates/interactions, and all that stuff is incredibly important when a team is trying to accomplish a goal together. It's much harder to do that when you've got 20 employees all doing their own thing and you can't just assemble everyone quickly. You're hurting your efficiency, you end up getting less done and with more mistakes/errors.\n\nSeparating your employees like that can also make it very difficult for managers to actually *manage* their employees. You may not realize it, but even on a team with just five people, if the leader doesn't communicate clearly and effectively, all five of those people can be on completely different pages. Ever do a major group project in college with like 4 other people and your team is all over the place, or one person takes forever to respond to your e-mails or texts?

As an example, when a mosquito ingests West Nile virus with a blood meal, the virus infects the cells in the mosquito's gut and replicates. The viral progeny then relocate to the mosquito's salivary glands and replicate to high levels there. By the time the mosquito bites another animal, the saliva is teeming with West Nile virus. When the mosquito bites an animal, it injects its saliva into the host, and the host can become infected with West Nile virus. Many viruses have evolved this life cycle, including the agents that cause diseases like yellow fever and dengue. Viruses like HIV and hepatitis have not evolved to replicate to high levels in mosquitoes, so mosquitoes do not transmit them, even though they can be transmitted by blood-to-blood contact."}]}

I'll try to walk you through a simple schematic, but I'm going to leave it up to you to look up some of the terminology, and assume that you know what the important components (capacitors, resistors, transistors, etc) do. There's a lot of ELI5 posts asking about pretty much all the components do, so that's a good resource, and _URL_5_ is an excellent resource for everything electronics.\n\nOkay, so the simplest schematic I could find was [this](_URL_0_), which is a very basic fuzz pedal. The way to start reading these is by identifying where the signals are entering and leaving. In this case, it's very straightforward; there's an input to the left, which will be AC, an output an the right (again, AC), and a 9V battery at the top, which supplies DC.\n\nIgnore the battery for now, and start at the \"guitar input.\" The first thing it runs into is a capacitor. Why?\n\nIn a lot of cases, you use capacitors to isolate areas of a circuit. The reason to do this is that capacitors block DC signals and allow AC, so if there's anything trying to bleed back from the battery, or some sort of weird leak from your guitar, it'll get blocked by the cap. If you're curious as to how that works, it's because of something called the principle of superposition. If you look at more complicated diagrams like [this](_URL_7_), you'll often see capacitors separating parts of the circuit, and that's why.\n\nAnyway, we go through the capacitor, and the circuit branches. On the upper branch, it hits the base of a transistor. What that means is that if there's a strong enough signal, the transistor will go into active mode, and it will amplify the signal, drawing current from ground to do so. Note that the top of the transistor is connected to the battery by a resistor; this is so the transistor gets power, which it needs in order to do amplification. If the signal is strong enough, the transistor will go into saturation (or \"rail\" as it's sometime's called), and the signal can't be boosted anymore. That's how you get the \"fuzz\" or distortion: when whatever amplification you're using gets railed, the peaks of the original waveform get cut off, like [this](_URL_3_).\n\nThere's also a second transistor, which is basically just another amplification stage (sort of, it's a little tricky). The important thing to note is that funny resistor/capacitor thing with the arrow in the bottom right corner. The arrow pointing to the resistor means that it's a potentiometer, so the resistance varies depending on what position you have the knob in. The point of that section is to serve as a tone knob, you have something very similar in your guitar itself. By the way, that's why people sometimes call the tone/volume knobs on your guitar \"pots\": it's short for potentiometer, which is a three-terminal variable resistor that looks like [this](_URL_4_), or [this](_URL_1_) on the inside.\n\nAnyway, the amplified signal comes out of the second capacitor, goes through a resistor (mostly to control the strength), then branches off into another cap. Again, that cap is to block any DC signal, so only the AC hits the output. There's another potentiometer (that's the arrow, remember), which controls the volume for the output, and we're done.\n\nAs you can see, these things are pretty complicated. That was by *far* the simplest schematic I could find, and I can 100% guarantee that the design would sound like crap. Hopefully it's at least a start, though, so you can eventually get to designing stuff like [this](_URL_6_) like a real man.\n\nAlso, it's not included in the diagram, but most pedals have what's called a bypass switch. A bypass switch is a two-position switch that routes to a different wire depending on the position. So, when you stomp your pedal, you're hitting a bypass switch.\n\nIn the \"off\" switch position, the signal gets sent through an entirely different wire that simply goes around all the components, which is why you can still play through a pedal that's turned off. In the on position, the signal goes through the pedal proper, and probably an LED, which is how the pretty lights turn on. If it helps, here's a [very well-executed and clear depiction of a bypass switch](_URL_2_).\n\nedit: if you have any questions other than \"what is a capacitor\" or whatever, feel free to ask and I'll try to go into more detail. The important things to learn are that transistors have cutoff/active/saturation modes, that capacitors block DC, and that batteries are important. Those three things are really the starting point for understanding how pedals work."}]}

As you can see from the [2011 Corruption Perceptions Index](_URL_1_), most of the PIGS are substantially more corrupt than Sweden and Finland.\n\n* Tax noncompliance.  Many of the PIGS (especially P,G) have a culture of tax-noncompliance.  People just don't pay what they owe.\n\n* Rigid labor markets.  G and S are especially famous for having very rigid labor markets with a lot of rules.  In Spain, it's so hard to fire or lay off someone, that many companies try to avoid hiring full time workers as much as possible, subsisting mostly on \"temporary workers\".  This is not a way to run a strong economy!  For instance, why would you invest in training and educating someone who's basically just a temp to you?  In Greece, it was basically impossible to fire or lay off public servants, leading to people who would go to work and do nothing all day, which brings me to my next point...\n\n* Culture of efficiency.  Although countries like Norway and Sweden have enormous governments (50% of GDP or higher), they are thought to be efficient compared to the PIGS governments, which are riddled with waste (and corruption)\n\n* Ease of doing business.  P,G,S especially have other tough restrictions on businesses, which lead them to have bad climates for developing a strong economy.  [Have a look at this chart](_URL_0_) - you'll see Greece is ranked 78th, worse than Belarus and Rwanda!!\n\n* Lack of a solid economic base.  In PIGS (I=Ireland here, not Italy) especially, the economies were not well-developed 10-15 years ago.  When they joined the euro-zone, suddenly the economies were exposed to a lot of very cheap, very accessible money.  This led to huge bubbles in various places like property, without the lack of a fundamentally strong economy backing up the price inflation.  Once the financial crisis hit and the money started drying up, the house of cards began to fall.  This is not true in many of the Northern European countries, which have had mostly strong economies since WWII (some fiscal crises notwithstanding).  If you look at [this chart from 1990](_URL_2_), you'll see all the usual suspects at the top of the GDP per capita list, having GDPs per capita *multiple times* that of the PIGS (except Italy and to a certain extent Spain)."}]}

Instead, I'll share a really cool idea a Professor of mine discussed with us in a Nietzsche class.  \nNietzsche, after studying TONS of work by philosophers, poets, educators, and religious leaders thought he discovered a very fundamental common thread:  \n Any piece of writing that could be considered \"philosophical\" couldn't possibly be just purely about ideas. No...instead, the writing by someone doing such high level thinking was actually an autobiography of sorts.  \nThe author, by expanding his high-level ideas into a body of work, be it a book, novel, or manifesto, was (unintentionally) ALSO using complicated logic and kilometers-long argument narratives to justify to the world some dark corner of his life.  \nThis concept, Nietzsche thought, would greatly aid any reader or thinker in truly understanding the works of those before them.  Take Louise Pascal, for example. He wrote about his wager, saying that people in doubt about God should \"bet\" that there was a God to minimize their possible eternal suffering. On the surface, it seems like the writing of someone who had a good idea. Nietzsche might go deeper to suggest that Pascal was probably very insecure about his religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and was justifying it with an apparently sound philosophical argument. This would certainly alter how you viewed his writings, would it not?   \n\nAs jolada pointed out though, Nietzsche also liked to laugh at himself. Chances are high, then, that Nietzsche was subtly telling his audience to consider all of his writing as though it were an autobiography and not to take all his ideas seriously...they could just be the ramblings of a madman. Or, maybe he knew some college student would realize this so he wrote an anti-autobiography. Or maybe he saw that coming, and is fucking with us HARD. Maybe."}]}

Your computer acts as the client, running the web page you requested, and transmits information to the web server, running the server application the web page is communicating with.\n\nWell, the programmer builds the web page, and they put forms for data in it (Like what is your username and password?), and when used appropriately, the server application should operate just fine. The problem is the client can manipulate any information going to the server that they want, and often the server never validates that the information coming through to it is legitimate.\n\nLet's say I've built a simple web site and web page that acts as a simple addition calculator for you. So my web page has two number pads, one on the left and one on the right, and a button at the bottom that says \"Add!\". So let's select \"2\" on the left, and \"5\" on the right, and hit the button. Now your web browser takes this information from the web page, and transmits it to the web server, and the web server runs the application adding the two numbers together, and communicates the result of \"7\" to you through another web page. Well, that's great... it works... but what happens when we lie to it?\n\nLets now create our own client, and instead of having two number pads, let's create two text fields! Now instead of selecting \"2\" on the left, and \"5\" on the right, let's type in \"John\" on the left and \"Doe\" on the right. When we communicate this information to the server, what's it going to do? Our application only knows numbers, but now we've received two words! Because I didn't program the application to check for words, it's going to attempt to add them together, and [this kills the application.](_URL_6_)\n\nNow, this example isn't that bad.

What about when you try to transfer -50,000,000,000 from Bill Gates (He won't miss it) account? If the programmer didn't make the application verify that the proposed transfer balance is between $0.01 and your balance of $2.04, it'll probably go through!

Why isn't this the case for tv channels?", "output": [{"answer": "I'll chip in with the economist's take on things.\n\n**Stock market** was historically a trading venue where you would sell cattle, grain and other similar goods. The stock market that we know today where you trade shares of companies actually served a different purpose. You bring your company there to acquire capital in exchange for dividend - a share in future profits -  and some voting power in the company.  That was the primary role of the stock market and price determination was just a coincidence. It serves as a determinant for the price of shares and valuation of companies because that's the main (often only) center of share exchange (purely legal reasons). As for the difference between huge IPOs and subsequent drops it is just part of the natural process of establishing real value of a good. The price is never set - any price - for good and it fluctuates constantly.\n\n**High speed trading** it is the same thing only done in a much shorter timeframe. The reason for it is mostly that the biggest volume of hi-speed trading is in options, futures and financial markets where there's no real capital other than money or title to money changing hands. In that respect it there's very little in terms of actual direct influence on anything other than the *price* of the good being traded. For example a share in a company implies share in profits, decision-making and other related areas of the company's life besides its value.  That means that a change of shares can cause change of strategy, personnel etc - and often it's precisely the point of the acquisition or sale of shares. In terms of financial instruments it's very rare for someone to want to acquire instruments for purposes other than price manipulation and/or realization of profits... say political blackmail. It's true that if you are an investor holding an instrument you might want to keep it for some specific reason (say you prefer a particular issuer or underwriter ... like preferring US or British bonds over Greek ones) but most people want just money and it is precisely *those people* who enter hi-speed trading markets. Those who have other aims stay away. So in that sense once you get the blackmailers and specific holders and other weirdos out the only real reason for trading such instruments is to realize temporary gains in value resulting from the instrument or options on it. Since you can only realize the gains if you *sell* the instrument it is absolutely logical and natural for the traders to want to have as many transactions as possible because every single transaction is an opportunity to generate profits or minimize losses.  Especially that in most such arrangements investors don't buy specific shares but portfolio units in the managing funds.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR - financial instruments on the hi-speed trading market are owned by people who do not care about anything other than pure financial value and the resulting loss/gain. Since they can be only realized in a transaction the larger the volume of transaction the better. Since you can't multiply instruments beyond certain parameters (options, derivatives etc) the only solution is to trade faster and faster and faster. Again the price-determining feature of the hi-speed market is purely coincidental.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs for whether it's good or bad there's really nothing wrong with it in principle and even if you consider the practical issues (bandwidth, database location etc) it's still just regular stock market sped up. If you realize that the stock market is just a huge marketplace with shares instead of potatoes then either *all* of it is wrong or *nothing* is. The problems with hi-speed trading are either those practical issues of inter-market violations which are not issues from the *economic* point of view - errors in execution or criminal activity (violation of agreed-upon rules) can't undermine it any more than the existence of theft and robbery never undermines voluntary transactions. They also often are  just an attempt to equalize other genuine problems somewhere else.  \n\nTake this example - many people demand higher taxes on financial institutions because of the implied reasoning that their high profits are somehow unfair (and they are). At the same time the unfair nature of their earnings is direct result from certain specific legal solutions put in place so the actual addressing of those issues would be to remove those solutions. Instead people focus on the immediate and say \"we don't care about your unfair privileges if you share the loot\". A lot of the rationale behind the attempts to tax or outlaw hi-speed trading, hostile takeovers and other similar practices is precisely that. People want to keep the stock market generating profits and growth but want to get rid of \"excesses\" or \"pathologies\" without understanding what begets what here. In other words they just want to both have the cookie and eat it at the same time. There is no economic argument for that, most of the existing ones are just political ones (as in economics being different from political economy)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: I forgot to explain why hi-speed trading exists in the first place. Explanation amended."}]}

If the area is unable to be farmed easily or resources are very difficult, then people have to focus all of their attention on how to get food and water (people have to walk hours for water in parts of Africa, for example).

That's why you see them associated with thunderheads -- the same updrafts that produce the towering cloud formations are also responsible for creating hail (or, they can be, anyway).  Essentially, the wind carries the tiny pieces of ice up in the cloud where they freeze (it gets pretty damn cold up there).  Once they've reached the top, they start to fall again.  Eventually, the wind catches them again and carries them back up, all the while freezing more and more layers of ice onto the piece of hail.  The size of a hail stone indicates how strong the wind was.  The stronger the wind, more times it can carry it up in the cloud, and the more ice can freeze onto the hail stone."}]}

They are travelling too fast relative to the air. What might be surprising is that it isn't the falling that does it. It's the rotational speed of the earth and orbit. The space station is moving fast. Much faster than you might realize. It orbits the earth once every 90 minutes. That's what keeps it from falling. You can think of it like centripetal force balancing out the force of gravity. \n\nImagine sticking your hand out the window of a car going 100 mph. Now imagine doing that in a car going 17,000 mph. That's what happens as the space station slowly dips into the atmosphere. \n\n\nRockets don't fire straight up. They start out facing up then curve torward the horizon to use their main engines to get their payload moving fast enough to orbit (17,000 mph or so). They and up on their side. The first stage (the part that lands) only boosts to about 4,000 mph. \n\nWhen Tesla rockets land, the actually have their engines going in the procedure. \nFirst, (using little side thrusters) they flip over and point their main engine forward. Then the fire the main engine to slow down from thousands of mph to a few hundred. This causes them to start to fall towards earth. They use their fins to stabilise themselves engine down (how they were oriented at launch) and fire their main engine a few more times to brake and slow their fall. As they touch down, they fire one last time just before touching the ground so they can land lightly. \n\nThe accuracy is astounding. I've been to the Tesla landing pad in Cape Canaveral.

Anything not seen is covered.  If waist down is under the covers, they have pants on.  If more skin is shown, the genitals are still covered as long as they're not shown (which is the vast majority of movies, it's hard not to get an X rating when genitals are seen in a sex scene).\n\nEven assuming that you're a straight guy who has to do a sex scene with a hot woman, and you both have to be completely naked, it's the least sexy way you could possibly have a naked woman in your arms.  The lights make it uncomfortably hot, you're both wearing tons of makeup, there are camera operators, mic operators, and a director watching you, the director is telling you what to do, you're doing a bunch of takes, etc.  It's very mechanical.\n\nNot to mention that if you're doing your job as an actor, you're in character and thinking really hard about acting.  The closest I've gotten is kissing on stage for a play--I've had to kiss incredibly beautiful girls, as well as a guy one time, and both were equally unexciting to me, but equally exciting to the characters I was playing."}]}

The next group of people get put on any remaining seats on flights following the same itinerary. Say there are 5 seats on the next flight, those get booked up. But I get the sense that you are talking about everyone else.\n\nMost major airlines have emergency booking deals with other airlines. So what they do is hop you from hub to hub on different airlines until you get home. Lets say a storm knocks out the midwest so MSP (Twin Cities) O'Hare (Chicago) and Detroit all have huge backups. You are trying to get from Chicago to Portland OR originally flying United. Day 1 you don't fly because of the storm. On day 2 you can't get there directly and you need to go through hubs, well Ohare is a major united hub and MSP is a major delta hub and SeaTac is an Alaska Airlines hub. So there is a 90% full delta plane that goes from ohare to MSP so you get put on that and get a two hour layover, to get on another delta flight out to seatac, which is also mostly full. from seatac you leave delta and get on Alaskan and fly into PDX (as they are both Alaskan hubs). Your buddy who is doing the same trip but on american will end up doing something like Ohare to Dallas Fortworth (DFW being an american hub) DFW to PHX on US Airlines (Phoenix being a US Airlines hub) and PHX to PDX on Alaskan (with Portland being an Alaskan Hub).\n\nThe mistake is thinking that because every flight is at 95% capacity means that there isn't any room. They just need to keep getting you one hub closer to home and it will eventually work it's self out. Over the course of a few days to possibly a week all the backlog is worked out and everyone is back to their standard capacity."}]}

{"id": "7rduum", "input": "How does Nintendo's labo work?", "output": [{"answer": "There are essentially two phases to a heartbeat:\n\n* systole, when the heart is contracting, and\n* diastole, when the heart is relaxing.\n\nEven during diastole though, blood is still moving through your arteries and veins.  You might think of it like filling up a funnel - you can fill it up but then it takes a bit of time for the fluid to run out the bottom.  Your blood vessels act like this because the heart fills up the arteries during systole, which have some spring to them, and then blood is still being squeezed off through capillaries and veins and back to the expanding heart during diastole.\n\nWhen the heart is contracting during systole, it is putting more fluid pressure into the arteries.  This is the higher number you get when taking your blood pressure.  When the heart is relaxing during the diastole, there is less pressure in the arteries.  This is the lower blood pressure number you get.\n\nThe blood pressure cuff is measuring the amount of pressure needed to counteract pressure in your blood vessels enough to compress your arteries and stop blood flow.  When the cuff is above systolic pressure, all blood flow is stopped past the cuff.  When the pressure is lowered below systolic but above diastolic pressure - blood flows through during systole but then the arteries slam shut during diastole, which can be heard with the stethoscope on your arm just below the cuff.  When the cuff pressure is lowered below diastole - then blood flows continuously and no sound can be heard."}]}

You have a flow through them, which you can turn on or off with another, much smaller flow.\n\nNow, how can we do so much with this:\n\nWell, there are two cases: analog and digital.\n\n**Analog:**\n\nYou don't have to open or close the valve all the way. This means that you can use a small flow (a weak signal) to regulate a much larger flow (a strong signal). This, basically, is an amplifier. You use a weak audio signal to control a much larger current through the transistor, driving a set of loudspeakers. Of course, an audio amplifier is just an example, they are very useful in other applications as well.\n\n**Digital:**\n\nIn this case, we only use the valve as an on or off. So, basically, we have a tiny, tine swithc which is operated by an electric signal.\n\nNow, you think, \"What's the use of that?\". Well, almost nothing. However, you can connect this with other switches. many of them, billions of them, creating a network (not network as in \"computer network\") of switches that can actually do things. By arranging them cleverly, you can set groups of them up as memory cells, you can add numbers in memory cells, you can move stuff between memory cells and so on.

For simplicity sake, we'll assume these are actual hours watched, not just an extrapolation from the number of views and video time. \n\nThe average Bit Rate of a 360P YouTube video is 768Kbps. There are 5.5 * 10^6 seconds in 1525hrs (watched each second). At 768Kbps per stream that works out to 4.5Tbps of constant bandwidth. Obviously some people are watching 480P, 720P, 1080P and even 2K or 4K videos at much higher Bit Rates. Peak time demand will be roughly double the average. I think it is safe to assume YouTube consumes at least 10Tbps of peak time bandwidth, if not double that much. \n\nIf we assume everyone is watching 1080P, that number goes up to a huge 50Tbps of average bandwidth, or probably close to 100Tbps of peak bandwidth.\n\n\nOn the upload side of things, 72 hours per minute works out to 1.2 hours per second. If we assume a Bit Rate of 1Mbps, that works out to around 5Gbps of constant uploaded video. I would also assume the Bit Rate of the average video is higher than that, so the peak time upload speed may be closer to 25Gbps. \n\nIf we assume everyone is uploading 1080P, this goes up to nearly 50Gbps of average traffic uploaded to YouTube.\n\nThe ratio of content consumed to content uploaded is about 1270:1."}]}

This is gonna be some weird Google searches, eh?\n\nDevelopment of male genitalia is dependent upon the production of the testosterone enzyme dihydrotestosterone, which is produced by the testes. As the various types of genital tubing is elongating and growing to form the penis, the penis organ system (both the  reproductive and unitary system) should contain folds. The folds lie on either side of the membrane that will begin to form the organ system, and move towards each other while they form a groove, this is known as the urethral groove. The urogenital folds fuse together on the ventral side of the developing penis, enclosing what will now become the urethra.\n\nWith a boy, the genital tuber will form the penis gland (the head). The body of the penis will be formed by the fusion of the urogenital folds, this fusion is not yet completely finished. The scrotum is formed by the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the midpoint of which corresponds to the zone of fusion of the labioscrotal folds.\n\nFemale development is pretty much the same, however at the point where the penis would form, a vagina forms instead since the folds on a female fetus will not fuse as well. Because of this, the tubes that would form the penis shaft will now form the labia. The genital tuber will form the clitoris.\n\nSo yes, more-or-less, where a clitoris would be is where the base of a penis would be, and vice versa."}]}

{"id": "6rb518", "input": "Why does getting your own place and leaving your parent's home such a big goal for Americans even though it could set them back financially.", "output": [{"answer": "I can actually answer this from personal experience. My family is your pretty generic flavor of low-middle-class white Americans. My family has been in America for generations and generations. At one point, my parents scraped together their savings and purchased two successful donut shops from a family of asian immigrants... after my family took them over, they were refurbished, cleaned up, and my Mom and Dad worked furiously for a couple years only to barely stay afloat despite increasing business. In the end, my parents nearly lost everything and had to sell it back.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nAs it turns out, much of the profitability of the donut shops were directly attributed to things like government subsidies/credits (programs that encourage and help immigrants to prosper), the fact that the previous owners used their entire family to keep the shop running (husband was the baker... who we had to keep on pay roll because he was too talented to replace, wife ran the front, kids cleaned up). My brother and I tried to help as much as we could, but we were both in school, so my parents had to hire a couple employees. On top of all of this, we were also unable to get the same pricing on materials and goods as the previous owners... as best as we could guess, the previous owners used their connections with others in their community to secure extremely low cost goods that, when we took over, were not available to us.\n\nSo the answer to your question isn't really specific to Koreans. Realistically, immigrants in general have a tendency to occupy these types of businesses and the type in question usually has a bias towards one culture/race due to there being existing connections. For example, **because** so many asians operate bakeries/donut stores/etc, when new asian immigrants arrive, they are more likely to be exposed to those types of businesses. Similarly, Indians are very strongly invested in Subway franchises (or at least that has been my experience over the years).\n\ntl;dr: These types of businesses are very appealing to operate for immigrants (little interaction with customers or need to communicate), it is an efficient way to turn labor into cash flow, and the immigrant's local community will provide a means to \"break into the business,\" which makes it easier to start making money when you arrive and less likely for you to risk venturing outside those established niches."}]}

They have gone through over a century of design and evolution.  At this point, it is pretty hard to beat a twin-triangle frame when it comes to a road going bicycle.  While groups like the UCI do influence design to some degree (e.g., twin-triangle, diamond frames are required for road racing), this design just works.  It is the best compromise between a number of factors such as weight, cost, torisional rigidity etc.  You do see more imaginative designs in the mountain bike world, but this is typically only in full suspension bikes where kinematics make a huge difference in suspension performance (and where patent rights often make a larger difference in design).  Basically, for a road going bike you are not going to improve on the current modern frame without spending a ton of cash on materials or development.  \n\nWith this bike in particular I can see a number of design flaws.  First, the wheels are the biggest issue.  Hubless wheels look cool but they are extremely complex mechanically.  With a standard wheel hubs are suspended within the center of the wheel.  This means that you only require a few bearings to efficiently rotate the wheel, where with this model you would require massive bearings that add both weight and complexity.  Likewise, traditional wheel bearings are held clear of the road surface, which means that contamination is less likely (I have to fix enough bearing issues with normal setups). Additionally, this bike utilizes an internal drivetrain.  While this will likely keep your pant leg cleaner and will be more resistant to grime, good luck servicing that thing with any ease.  Likewise, most gear-box based systems (as opposed derailleur based) tend to be draggy and generally less efficient for a given weight and cost (try riding a high-end Rohloff hub vs a high end XTR or Dura-ace setup -- the Rohloff feels like you are pedaling in mashed potatoes).  Finally, that frame looks really heavy.  Even in a carbon setup, to get rigidity out of a frame like this, you will need a LOT of material in comparison to a traditional frame.\n\nTLDR:  Wheels are far to complex and heavy.  The drivetrain packaging is probably a pain. Modern bicycles are a mature technology. Literally reinventing the wheel will only result in marginal (if any) gains."}]}

They also feel more \"mushy\" whereas the capacitive ones usually feel like they are made of \"solid\" glass. \n\nThe way a resistive touch screen works is that there is a membrane on the outside layer which you press down when you touch the screen, when you press it down it hits another membrane, less than a millimeter below the first layer and creates an electrical contact. From the contact it can be calculated where you pressed, these touch screens are the ones you can operate with pretty much anything like a pencil or a hard-tip stylus. (if you want to see an example of a resistive touch screen check this video out:_URL_0_)\n\nNow, the one in your phone is likely a capacitive touch screen, the way this works is by sensing the capacitance around the screen. It creates a static field which is then disrupted at a particular point by the human body which acts as a capacitor in instances like this and actually drains some of the charge out of the field at the point you touch. \n\nThe reason the styluses for these screens are different than the old DS stylus type of thing (which was just a piece of plastic) is that newer styluses have to be able to interact in the same fashion with your phone."}]}

However, there is a potential light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nSuppose you last for 10 years or more. In that time, you've kept your head down and your nose clean. You want to legitimize yourself. You can essentially *ask* ICE for a court date (seems weird, I know). During this hearing, you can present certain information that backs up your request for a valid immigrant status. For example, you could show that:\n\n* you've gone to college / trade school / etc since your arrival in an effort to better yourself and become a more productive member of society;  \n* you've had children since your arrival. They are natural-born US citizens, and you can say it would be too harsh and unduly difficult for your family if you were to be deported;  \n* your child, regardless of status, has some kind of medical condition for which they would not get proper treatment in your country (I was surprised to learn that some Latin American countries do not have much in the way of Special Ed, for example);  \n* alternatively, that *you* could be in some danger if you were to be deported. If you can say the government would be the ones after you for some reason, you can usually just come in as a refugee instead of going through all this bullshit, but what if it's an abusive husband or an organized crime group?\n* you've been within the borders of the US *the entire time* (this one is big);  \n* you don't have a serious criminal record (ideally, you don't have *any* criminal record);  \n* letters of support from people willing to vouch for you before the US government, preferably people who you have known for some time and who have some trustworthiness of their own (I used to suggest clergy, bosses, business associates, community members, etc). \n\nIf all goes well at this hearing, you get to stay. Theoretically, you can even present all of that if you get arrested before your 10 years is up, but it can be more of an uphill battle. \n\n\n**TL;DR**   \nYou're an illegal alien if you're still in the US the day after your visa expires.

So bad, in fact, the Coke didn't want to tarnish the brand of their regular soda...instead they created a new brand, marketed mostly towards women, called Tab. That was their marketing plan, and they stuck with it for nearly 20 years.\n\n Upstart Pepsi took a different approach. Their soda's consistency and flavor lent itself to artificial sweeteners a little better, so they were able to formulate a diet version that was slightly less terrible. The marketed it under the Pepsi brand, and it slowly grew to dominate the diet market.\n\n By the early 1980s, Coke had had enough, and decided it was time for their own Coke brand diet soda. But the same factors that made Diet Pepsi successful worked against them...try as they might, they just couldn't make the Coke recipe work with the sweeteners of the day. They stopped trying, and invented a completely new recipe (one many say was more like Pepsi), and marketed that as Diet Coke. It was wildly successful, and very quickly started to take market share away from Diet Pepsi.  \n\n In fact, Diet Coke was a bit too successful. A few year later, facing stiff competition from Pepsi in their regular cola line, Coke abandoned their nearly century old recipe, creating a regular version of Diet Coke, which tested better than the old Coke or Pepsi. When they didn't anticipate was the extreme nostalgia for the original Coke, and \"New Coke\" went down as one of the biggest marketing blunders in history. Coke eventually was forced to reintroduce the original as Coca-Cola Classic, the public never acquired a taste for New Coke, and it was eventually phased out.\n\nFinally, in 2005, with new sweeteners available to them, Coke took another swing at a diet version of the original formula, and came up with Coke Zero. Claiming it was \"indistinguishable\" from regular Coke, it has largely been marketed towards men, and has gained a significant share of the diet soda market.\n\n \nSo to recap:\n\nDiet Coke = Diet New Coke before New Coke existed\n\nCoke Zero = Diet Old Coke\n\nHope that clears things up."}]}

Usually you can still evaluate the ruins to see where the fire burned to longest.  As you trace through the remains you look at char patterns, also your looking for material that completely burned up and materials that partially burned.  Generally the area of origin is the most destroyed, or reduced to ash area.  This allows for a theoretical point of origin.  At this point you interview homeowners or building owners to determine what was located in this area.  Sometimes they will remember leaving a candle burning or a heavily loaded power strip.  More theories can be generated.  Looking at building plans if they are on file can also aid in tracing the cause.  Sifting through the debris in that area helps a lot.  It is very seldom that a house is pure ash.  Fire cause determination can be a long tedious process.  Most departments only do a drawn out cause determination if arson is suspected.

With the development of hydrolic fracturing (fracking) techniques, the United States has become the world's largest producer of natural gas just in the last decade or less.

The ATF got a warrant to investigate and approached the compound armed. The Davidians didn't take too kindly to this so fended them off. Siege ensues. \n\nATF have no understanding and training to deal with religious cults so they treat it like a stand off between terrorists. They shine bright light on the compound during the night, play loud sounds like heavy metal, babies crying, animals being slaughtered. Psychological warfare and that jazz.\nTrapped, David Koresh looks to scripture (especially revelations) for help (he thinks he's Jesus btw). The Branch Davidians like all adventist groups have a trend of apocalyptic beliefs (which makes them volatile and more likely to turn to violence). With the psychological warfare, being trapped, and extremist religious beliefs, David concludes that it is the beginning of apocalypse they've been expecting. The ATF are agents of Satan and they are fighting a cosmic battle.\n\nNot understanding this religious dimension the ATF continue to fulfil the Davidian world view through their aggression. FBI were concerned they all might try and kill themselves and that the children in the compound were being abused (David had many under age wives). \n\nSo they want to get the situation wrapped up. Two 'tanks' are sent to puncture the wall and shoot gas in so everyone can be rounded up. Somehow a fire starts (either caused by the breaking of the walls or started by the Davidians). Little attempt is made by the Davidians to escape. 75 people die in the fire.\nControversial because the ATF handled it so poorly. All they needed was a bit of understanding rather than force. The Davidians, although they had weapons, were no real danger to anyone other than themselves (although including the children). The ATF didn't consider the way in which the people inside would see the external aggression.\n\nCults and sects practice encapsulation - either social or physical (which is why they had a compound). This encapsulation is useful to create a safe space where no descenting opinions are tolerated, and the believers can re-enforce each others spirituality, the environment is completely controlled. The distancing themselves from society is crucial to maintain the religious atmosphere which is very important to members (otherwise they would realise how obscure what they are doing is and regain their sense of normality). If something threatens this boundary between the group and society it causes instability (and so more likely a chance of violence). Despite the tragedy the Davidians are considered as having very low group tension (it took a long siege and plenty of aggression on the part of the ATF to initiate a fatal response). This differs from Jonestown (Guyana cult suicide) which were a high tension group as the fatal response came about after a simple visit from a US senator.\n\n\n_URL_0_"}]}

Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.[7]  \n  \nIn 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56 that formally regulated fighting, or \"fisticuffs\" as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a five-minute major penalty. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America.[7] Promoters such as Tex Rickard of Madison Square Garden, who also promoted boxing events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.[12]\"\n\n[Source](_URL_6_)"}]}

{"id": "246wkc", "input": "Why does the severe weather alert system that broadcasts over your television sound like I'm logging on to the internet in the 90's?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm surprised someone with a good knowledge of neurochemistry hasn't stepped in and properly explained this. I'm only halfway through a Psych degree so I'm hardly the best candidate, but I'll do my best.\n\nThere are three things I want to outline here: 1) Why it isn't possible to take any currently available drug long-term and have it remain effective, 2) Why future forms of neural stimulation that may be developed also won't initially be effective long-term (but may become so), and 3) what is the closest drug available to what you described.\n\n1. Basically, drugs cause the release of neurotransmitters (namely Dopamine and Serotonin) that make you feel good. As other comments have pointed out though, as your body adjusts to the drug you will need an increased dose to achieve the same high. This is known as 'habituation' in Psychology. So, in order to achieve the same effect you would need a drug that was completely non-toxic or else it would be dangerous to continuously increase the dosage. And with every substance there's a limit as to how much you can put in your body. Even water (it's difficult but possible to drown your own body) and air (oxygen toxicity can lead to death) have their limits. So for any substance that must be consumed, we're going to reach an upper limit. Although we don't have to reach that upper limit for a drug to remain effective, any toxic effects that a drug has are going to worsen as we increase our dosage. Most drugs are going to have those toxic effects (save a few, which I'll address in the third section).\n\n2. Even if we develop the technology to directly stimulate the brain and cause it to release large amounts of Dopamine and Serotonin (and therefore avoiding the issue of toxic side-effects), the effect of habituation will remain an issue. Remember, these and other neurotransmitters exist for a reason; they are there to condition our behaviour, to make us perform advantageous behaviours more, and disadvantageous ones less. Constantly flooding our brains with these neurotransmitters would mean totally messing with our brain chemistry. We would lose the motivation to perform many behaviours that are crucial for our well-being or survival. I'm not against taking drugs at all (I strongly believe in a policy of total legalisation), but I think it's important for anyone who uses them even infrequently to remember that they are changing the way your brain's reward functions work. Now, it may be one day that we can so directly influence brain chemistry that we can flood our brains with Dopamine or Serotonin, enjoy the high, and then revert our brains to their status pre-high. But that level of bioengineering will come sometime after we have the ability to crudely influence our brain chemistry as in the example I gave above.\n\n3. Finally, for the moment there are multiple drugs now that have little to no toxic effect on your body or mind in the short-term (NOT long-term though, but I'll come back to this). LSD is the most prominent one, and as TERRAOperative pointed out: \"Pure LSD is completely metabolised by your body in 6-12 hours (no traces left stored in fat etc), it is not chemically addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose.\" \n\nThe only potential downsides in the short-term are the extremely terrifying and overwhelming experiences that are possible on LSD. These are unlikely to cause long-term negative effects beyond the trip, but they are hellish to go through, especially as the increased subjectivity of time can make seconds seem like minutes, minutes seem like hours, etc. If you have a positive set and setting, and do it with the right people, you're less likely to experience this, but there are no guarantees.\n\nThat is literally the worst case scenario though. In the past it was thought that LSD could cause the initial episode of psychosis in people who were susceptible to it, but this theory seems to have been disproven through repeated studies.\n\nFinally, as I mentioned in the second section, even a drug that has no toxic effects on your body will still have toxic effects on your mind over time. LSD, if taken frequently over an extended period (let's say a few years) will alter your brain chemistry significantly. Long-term LSD users can affect their spatial awareness, perception of time, ability to concentrate, and much more. Ever met a (sober) spaced-out hippy who you felt you could barely get through to? That's the effect of LSD long-term; it changes your version of reality drastically.\n\nAnd in the end, that's the reason why, until bioengineering makes massive advances, we won't be able to create a drug that performs the function you are asking for. Our brains are constantly changing and adapting, and although they have the ability to balance out the effects of most experiences we put them through, continuously hitting the 'pleasure button' in our brain is going to lead to alterations in its chemistry that will irreversibly change our perception of reality. Maybe it's a more enjoyable reality to live in, but most people, including myself, aren't going to take the risk to find out."}]}

This is why there is 'clean diesel' here in the USA. Since 2008, diesel engines needed to follow stricter EPA standards then again a few years later, plus diesel fuel has been further refined to reduce sulfur emissions....because diesel fuel is 'oil' it does not burn as efficiently as gas so you see a lot of the unburned fuel (and soot) come out as black exhaust\u2026.in 2008 manufactures started adding bigger EGR valves (exhaust gas regenerator) which takes the exhaust gas, runs it back through the engine to burn off the excess then out the exhaust. However, before leaving the tail pipe the exhaust system has a large canister (diesel particulate filter) that is filled with ceramic mesh to collect the soot. As the mesh gets saturated with soot and the engine will detect this then run on one less cylinder thus dumping raw fuel into the exhaust which collects in this filter. When this happens, a plug will ignite the wasted fuel to burn off the soot in the filter to clean that filter. The end result is clear, cleaner exhaust. Further technology now introduces urea into the exhaust particulate filter to reduce the emissions even more. Unfortunately, although cleaner the downside of this is less fuel mileage and greater maintenance issues resulting from this process."}]}

These aren't actually laws per say. You can just look at the world as billiard balls. Angular momentum isn't something different that happens when things rotate, instead it is the same laws that billiard balls obey, but the natural conclusion of that behavior when the balls are stuck together.\n\nSo whenever you are confused just think of billiard balls. Instead of a rotating risk, think of 2 large billiard balls moving in exactly opposite direction at exactly the same speed, but slightly offset from each other. Then imagine them being connected by a metal rod. This is now our rotating disk and when I say \"disk\" from now on you should imagine two billiard balls, connected by a rod.\n\nNow imagine it isn't rotating and you want to turn this disk. You have no problem.\n\nNow imagine the risk is rotating very fast. Let's freeze time when one billiard balls is directly above the other. At this time on billiard balls is moving 100 miles per hour in one direction, and the other ball is moving 100 miles per hour in the other direction.\n\nImagine what happens after you rotate the risk 90 degrees now. Now the top billiard balls is moving at 100 miles per hour but in a completely different direction. Before it was (for example) moving north at 100miles per hour, now it is moving east and 100 miles per hour. It takes a huge amount of energy to achieve this change.\n\nSo now you get why rotating things are way more stable. As for the gyroscopic procession. That is more complicated, and you would have to think very hard, but still understandable through billiard balls. There is just weird interaction between the rods and the table that makes it happen."}]}

Wool is not as good as the synthetic materials for wicking sweat and cooling, but a thin and slim-fitting wool garment will still keep you cool. The wool also takes much longer time to dry than synthetics, but will not feel as wet to the skin as other fabrics. Wool will still keep you warm even when damp. In comparison, wet synthetics are very cold. Edit: One disadvantage of wool is that it is not as durable as cotton or synthetics. \n\n \nCotton is basically good for three things only: It is soft and comfortable, cheap, and durable.

This is called \"demand pull\" inflation.\n\n2) Cost push inflation: Imagine this same village. The nearby water well is starting to dry up, so the water company is charging more for water since it's becoming more scarce. Everyone needs water, and every business needs water to operate. So anything that's sold now costs more, because businesses have to pay more to get their water to make their goods.  The rising cost of the raw material, water, is now pushing the prices of goods up in the village."}]}

Later, towards the current time, we needed a way to collaborate scientific findings and share them so we started using the same units of measurements (e.g. in Europe).\n\nThe time thing, that's just the effects of colonization. The people who ware taking you over communicated this way, so you had to communicate this way. Countries that originated from European immigrants (e.g. most of the current Americas) happened to adopt this because this was what they were used to. Although the US didn't really use the same units of length because at the time of parting, units of length weren't standard (e.g. the length of a foot was quite literally the length of the king's foot). Since we didn't really collaborate much with Europe, we didn't feel that we had a need convert our units of measurement for length to SI units. \n\nOf course, this just makes things complicated today when we need screw drivers that have units in both SI and English units."}]}

{"id": "1lxuuy", "input": "American Alcohol Age Restriction.", "output": [{"answer": "Ill try to answer this most unbiased as possible. I will try to add links where possible, but some things about this group remain very obscure and hard to fully comprehend. I am \"observing\" this group since its early days in the syrian civil war, thus I might have some insights that help explaining. \n\nThe origins of this group actually remain within the chaotic times of 2. Gulf War of 2003. The power vacuum emerging after the fall of the regime was quickly filled by various militant groups within irak - put very very simple, some of them would later become what we call \"IS\" or \"Daesh\" today, being \"Al Quaida in Iraq\" back in these times. See this documentary for reference: _URL_3_\nAlso, see this article for reference: _URL_3_  - check \"foundation of the group\" paragraph. \n\nAfter the \"islamic revolution\", the beginning of the civil war in syria and after assad regime started to comit crimes against their own people, these \"militants\" quickly moved into syria and established a foothold there, being part of the so called \"al nusra front\" which is said to have close ties to al quaida. Original (or \"official\") goal was / is to topple assad's regime). \nSee: \n_URL_3_ - \"Syrian Civil War Section\" \n\nRegarding the initial ELI5 question, its worth mentioning that the \"Al Nusra Front\" was labelled as \"Terrorist Organisation\" by various international instances, i.e. by the US - which led to massive protests within syria as the perception of the group within syria tended to be somewhat more a \"freedom fighter\" group than terrorists. \nAfter internal controversies, parts of Al Nusra front eventually parted away and formed ISIS / ISIL. \nSee this article for reference: \n_URL_3_\n\nHaving pointed out the origins and the first reason why IS percieves US as enemy (labelling al nusra as \"terrorists\"), i now try to give more answers to the original question. \n\nAs their origins, as stated before, lie within the 2. Gulf War, these people percieve the US and their allies as \"invaders\" or even \"modern crusaders\". Morally doubtful actions on side of the coalition (death of civilians, abu greibh torture, etc.) IMO fueled this image - not in Iraq alone, but also in other muslimic oriented countries. Also the events around Guantanamo Bay might have paid onto this as well (burning quran books, sexual harassment, etc.) - thats the reason why IS puts their \"captives\" into these orange overalls, its a reference to the detainees in guantanamo. So, I guess its safe to say that various people / groups (\"including al quaida in iraq\") got really angry at the US in this point of time. \n\nSo, after some years of battle in iraq, the group expanded into syria with a high chance of carrying their perception of US to syria, , maybe spreading their beliefs in these regions. \n\nThen, the situation in syria spiraled down into complete chaos, bloodshed and atrocities. IMO the original ELI5 question is a bit misleading as it implies that US really supported syrian rebel groups with various help - whereas in reality, they only supplied them with light weapons and basic training, carried out by the CIA, thus being a covered operation. One could get the impression that the US were not really willing to step in, only making shady moves to support their own goals in this region - which was to destabilize assad regime for their own interest. For the syrian John Doe, this is surely a hot topic, as he can see his country falling apart without the self-claimed \"world police\" willing to step in - whereas they happily invaded iraq based on, put plainly, lies several years before. \"Why invade iraq, but not syria if one can see videos of the cruel things happening here? Why are they not helping us?\" \n\nFinally, IMO, IS sees the US as a supporter of Isreal. As IS sees israel as occupants of \"their\" land, they might see the US as a supporter of their enemy Israel. \n\nAlso, one must understand that IS is a highly efficient group. They have public relation departments, establish certain \"state\" structures within their territory, etc. etc. Hell, they even have \"Special Forces\". Its not a semantic coincidence that they refer to themselves as a \"state\" - the islamic state. There are people within the group that really think these things through in detail and try to come up with a real plan and structure. They are not as \"stupid\" as one might think. Just look at their \"home-made\" propaganda, its highly professional, well made, well edited, distributed in various channels etc - these people exactly know what they are doing. I think they use the general negative perception of the US in islamic countries (as pointed out above) in a very clever way to fuel hatred and negative attitude and somehow manage to turn that into real actions or heinous acts (murder, hostage taking, etc.). Also i believe, that many supporters of IS join the fight because they think they have to \"defend islam\" or \"take revenge\" for the \"crimes\" that the US did, i.e. in Iraq. One must also take into account that religion in these parts of the world is very very important and possible \"violations\" of the religious rules (guantanamo) can quickly escalate into serious happenings. \n\nLastly, look at the social structure. Who is actually fighting for IS? Mainly, its disaffected young guys that, in some cases, only have their religion left as a \"social stabilizer\" as maybe their parents were killed / tortured, their friends dead and their houses destroyed. Its very easy to \"steer\" these \"lost\" souls into a desired direction - which IS shamelessly does in a very effective way. They unite these kids under the \"Blame the US\" banner very easily. \n\nI hope I pointed out some reasons why IS hates the US. Please feel free to feedback and share your opinion on my analyses. Try to stay unbiased - its hard looking at the crimes they comit, but only a sensible and rational analysis will solve the problem (surely someone will answer \"bombs do too\")\n\nExecutive Summary AKA \n\nTL; DR: \nWhy does IS hate the US? \n1. Crimes during Iraq War and during occupation\n2. Torturing islamic people at guantanamo \n3. General Support of Isreal \n4. No / hardly no help during syrian civil war \n5. Hate against US only \"tool\" to steer people into desired direction"}]}

{"id": "3i10px", "input": "Why are stimulants used to treat ADHD?", "output": [{"answer": "You have regulatory hormones in your body that create a natural cycle. Some of these hormones work by inhibiting their own production while triggering the production of a different hormone that does the same thing. So as hormone A builds up in your body, you slow down making more of it, until your body is saturated and can't make any more until what's there goes away. At the same time, when hormone A can't be made you begin production of hormone B that does the same thing. By controlling how much of the ingredients of the hormones are available and how fast they are produced and destroyed, you create a biological clock. The amounts of those hormones in your body can trigger other hormones that regulate other parts of your circadian rhythm, like your hunger.\n\nYour body can regulate and calibrate your clock with input from your behavior and your environment. As much as your circadian rhythm controls your hunger, your eating habits affect your circadian rhythm right back. If you have a regular sleep schedule and regular meal schedule, you'll notice that you get hungry right around the same time every day. So even if you, say, eat a late lunch you will probably still be a little hungry at your normal dinner time. If you start messing with your meal times, though, you will find that your sleep schedule adjusts to match it.\n\nThe most important \"calibration\" comes from light. Light hitting your retina triggers the production of enzymes that destroy melatonin in your body and inhibit its production. When it's dark, your body begins producing it again. Melatonin is the hormone that makes you feel *sleepy*. Not tired, mind. There's a difference, although when you are tired you will also produce more melatonin. By \"tired\" I mean \"need sleep\" and by \"sleepy\" I mean that feeling when you are laying down, closing your eyes, and falling asleep. Obviously, when you need sleep your body will produce melatonin to cause you to sleep. Melatonin triggers a cascade of other hormones and neurotransmitters that tell your brain to begin its sleep cycles. It also helps regulate the rest of your circadian rhythm and ensure that the other parts of your biological clock that run internally without usually having any input are synced up to your actual sleep  schedule and meal schedule.\n\nWhen light (especially higher frequencies like blue) hits your eyes - typically through your eyelids - your body once again starts destroying the melatonin, which stops the \"be sleepy\" signals and allows other hormones and neurotransmitters to bring you out of your sleep cycles. Your sleep cycles have their own neurotransmitters, too, and after going through a few of them, you will likely wake up regardless of the time of day (or night). On the other hand, if you have a large sleep debt - say, because you haven't slept in three days - you will produce enough melatonin that light will not immediately destroy enough of it to allow you to wake up.\n\nYou can also wake up with noises and nudges through a different mechanism that side-steps your melatonin signals. That usually involves dumping adrenaline into your body, getting you ready to fight or flee. That's why alarm clocks usually leave you awake but feeling groggy and tired - your brain woke you up because it thought there was an emergency, but the melatonin is still there making you sleepy.\n\nWaking up at the same time, even if there isn't any light to do help, still regulates your circadian rhythm so you usually find that with a very regular sleep schedule you will usually wake up *around* the same time your alarm goes off.\n\nThings worth noting: caffeine blocks melatonin receptors, so the melatonin is still there, it just isn't causing the \"be sleepy\" signals to go off. When you \"build tolerance\" to caffeine, you're not actually becoming resistant to the drug, you're just accumulating additional sleep debt. Meaning, there's just *more melatonin* because you have greater need for sleep. If you want good sleep, avoid caffeine after 3 to 4pm.\n\nKeeping your room as dark as possible will help you sleep. Avoid blue light, especially at night. There are apps for your phone and computer that will change the color of your screen to remove much of the blue (I use f.lux).\n\nHaving a regular meal schedule will help you have a regular sleep schedule. Avoid meals late at night, especially sugary foods.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that chronically getting less than 7.5-8.5ish hours per night leads to poorer scores on cognitive ability tests. Many subjects reported after months of getting 6ish hours of sleep that they had adjusted and felt as if they could perform just as well as someone with the normal 8ish hours. However, *they still had the same level of cognitive deficiency*, meaning their perception of their tiredness had adjusted, but not their actual ability to perform. After a few months of normal sleep, they recovered and were able to perform normally on cognitive ability tests. More ominously, even after three months of normal sleep, the subjects who reported chronic sleep of 4 hours or less had *not* recovered and still performed poorly on cognitive ability tests. Mini TLDR: sleep is important, you can't function as well as you think you can without it."}]}

{"id": "13mhgz", "input": "how free apps without ads make money.", "output": [{"answer": "There's a proof (Cantor's diagonalization argument). Before we start, a couple things: we're only going to focus on the decimal numbers between 0 and 1, meaning any number that has a (possibly infinite) decimal expansion in [0, 1]. Examples are: 0.5, 0.11\u2026, 0.12345\u2026, and so on. If there are more decimal numbers between 0 and 1 than there are counting numbers, then there have to be more decimal numbers on the whole real line than there are counting numbers. The other thing: how to tell if one set is bigger than another set. If you can line up the elements of your first set and match them up with the elements of the second, then they're the same size. Otherwise, the set with elements left over is bigger. Example: if you have two hands and two gloves, you match one glove to each hand - >  you have the same number of hands and gloves. If you try with two hands and three gloves, you match one glove to each hand, and you have one glove left over, so the set of gloves is larger than the set of hands.\n\nNow suppose that the set of decimal numbers between 0 and 1 is the same size as the set of counting numbers. (\"There's only one size of infinity.\") Then there's a way to pair them off, one by one. What that means is that I can *index* the decimal numbers: this one is the first, this one is the second, \u2026 this one is the 500th, \u2026 and I keep going. I'm going to show that there's a decimal number left over. Take the first decimal number. The first digit after the decimal point is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If it's a 2, I take 3. Otherwise, I take 2. That's the first digit after the decimal point of my *new* number. Keep going like this: for the 2nd (or 3rd, or 1000th) place after the decimal point, I take a digit that's *not* the digit in the 2nd (or 3rd, or 1000th) place of the 2nd (or 3rd, or 1000th) place decimal number.\n\nFor example, if the first three decimal numbers in my pairing are 0.6, 0.1234567\u2026, and 0.777\u2026, then my new decimal number starts: 0.232, and I keep adding digits.\n\nNow I've built up a decimal number, digit by digit, that's not equal to any of the decimal numbers that I counted off. So I missed one! That's a contradiction: I never had a way to pair off the decimal numbers with the counting numbers in the first place, so my original assumption was wrong. Therefore there are more decimal numbers between 0 and 1 than there are counting numbers.\n\nYou actually can't do this with an \"infinity + 1\". If you take the counting numbers, and the counting numbers with one extra element (say, -1, for simplicity), then you can pair them off easily: -1 with 0, 0 with 1, 1 with 2, and so on. Each element of the counting numbers is matched to exactly one element of the \"counting numbers plus one\", so those sets are the same size. But the real numbers are conceptually tricky, and more exotic stuff can happen.\n\nEdit: Added example for clarity."}]}

Near the surface of the earth, it's around 9.8 meters per second, or 32 feet per second per second if you're American. If you go up higher, it's less, but the effect is generally negligible until you're miles and miles up in the air.\n\nAnyway, that's not what matters, really. Gravity is an *acceleration* (force, technically), not a *velocity* (speed, for our purposes). An acceleration is a change in velocity. For example, if your car goes from 0 mph to 10 mph in a second, it *accelerated* by 10 mph per second.\n\nAcceleration is caused by *force*. Force is, loosely, a \"push.\" When a force acts on a mass, it causes an acceleration. Weight (ie pounds*) is actually a measure of force, specifically the force due to gravity, which is why you weigh less on the Moon even though your mass is the same.\n\nWhen you push on something, you're applying a force to it. You change its velocity, which is an acceleration. Similarly, gravity pushes (really, pulls) on everything with mass, so it is applying an acceleration. \n\n*by the way, \"kilograms\" are commonly and somewhat incorrectly used as a unit of weight. kilograms are a unit of mass. the correct metric unit for weight/force is \"Newtons,\" and the correct Imperial (American) unit of mass is \"slugs,\" so it's very strange that people use \"kg\" and \"lb\" interchangeably."}]}

The game knows where your position is, how does it act like it doesn't know where you are?", "output": [{"answer": "> And, what benefits does 4K have over 1080p?\n\nEasiest question, 4K is 4 times the resolution (or often a little more) than 1080P. So basically more pixels, this allows it to deliver a more crisp image, for example go to youtube and watch the videos at different resolutions.\nIf we need to review resolution, the numbers signifiy the amount of pixels. A pixel is a tiny square on a monitor which can change to a variety of different colors. Many pixels make up a screen, so 1080p resolution refers a grid of 1920 pixels in one dimension, and 1080 in the other.\n\n 4K refers generally to 2 different resolutions, 4096 \u00d7 2160, often called DCI and also known as True 4K, since it actually has 4 thousand pixels in one dimension, hence the name 4K, but it is also used to refer to 3840 \u00d7 2160, which is exactly 4 times the resolution of 1920 x 1080 (doubled in each dimension), while it doesn't reach that many pixels, it was called 4K because it is 4 times the resolution of 1080p and about 4 thousand pixels, but it is also known as UHD, or Ultra HD.\n\nDifference between 1080p and SD (which is 720\u00d7480 pixels and some close variants) is again, resolution, go on YouTube and scroll through the different resolutions on a video, you will notice that lower resolutions are worse. Do this in full screen.\n\n\nHDR, is known as High Dynamic Range, and essentially deals with this, it allows for sharper colors and lighting, and has become popular in recent years. It is not like HTML 4 vs HTML 5.\n\nHow does it do this? Normally images are stored like this, you set the dimensions of an image, lets say 1920 by 1080 pixels, and you color in each pixel. How? You assign 3 numbers to each pixel, each from 0 to 255. These three numbers correspond to how much a color shows itself, three colors only being needed to reproduce all light we can see, red, green, and blue, the lower the number for any of these, the more the pixel becomes that color. If you want to make a video, that is just a bunch of images moving fast, but these three numbers are key.\n\nTo see how three numbers can reproduce all different colors we can see, you can take a look at [this](_URL_0_) website. Ignore the boxes for H S and V, those are just a something that makes it easier to navigate the graph of colors on the left.\n\nSo, High Dynamic Range. I lied slightly, this cannot produce all the colors we can see, but it can make very good estimations. Let's say you want to let in an amount of red light between 10 and 11, what do you do? You would have to round to the nearest number, HDR solves this partially.\n\nHigh Dynamic Range is just a fancy wording for a system that allows for RGB values to be more than 255 (this is known as standard dynamic range). HDR10 can have 0 to 1023 different values for the colors (why 255 and 1023, that is because this data is stored in binary, 0 to 255 allows for 256 different numbers, the maximum different numbers possible with 8 binary digits, 10 binary digits allows for 1024 different numbers, which is why it is called HDR10). Other types of HDR exist, Dolby Vision (which could be called HDR12) for example uses 12 binary digits for a whooping 4096 different values for each color.\n\nSo if your TV supports HDR10, and whatever you are doing, such as using an Xbox, also supports HDR10, then you are in luck, however if the TV does not support HDR10 or something like Dolby Vision, which is higher but reverse compatible with HDR10 (meaning it can also do HDR10), then you are in luck. Though for now, many TV shows for example do not broadcast in HDR."}]}

For most readers, books take much longer to listen to than read. For reference, I'm currently catching George R.R. Martin's *A Storm of Swords* on audio. It's a daunting read, to be sure, but the unabridged audiobook exceeds 48 solid hours. (FYI - The reader, Roy Datrice, is pretty excellent.)\n\nA lot of people don't want that level of detail. In a work like *A Song of Ice and Fire,* to return to my example, there is a lot of exposition and detail that could be culled and leave the listener with a more or less complete understanding of the plot. So for that reason, many people are willing to pay less for less book.\n\n >  What are the \"copyright restrictions\" and why would they make any sense? \n\nAny commercial performance of a copyrighted work needs to be licensed, and a rightsholder can choose to license some forms of the work (e.g., an abridged audiobook) and not others (e.g., an unabridged audiobook). Similarly, the rightsholder can choose to limit a license to a certain market. This is often the product of a lot of negotiations between the rightsholder and the party making the audiobook; there's a lot of back and forth to find the optimal price point that will work for both parties."}]}

Perhaps OP was asking why smoking while hungover makes the hangover worse. Perhaps they were asking why smoking while drinking makes the hangover worse. I answered the second question. The answer to both is the same: unknown.\n\nDoctor here.  This is the type of question that invites a lot of speculation based on various popular myths about what causes a hangover. Since the process underlying a hangover itself is not well known, an explanation on why it would be exacerbated by nicotine is going to be even more speculative. \n\n However I want to offer something more than just \"nobody knows\". One likely explanation could be explained by the phenomenon  of the date rape drugs. In the emergency department it is not uncommon for young women and sometimes men to come in complaining that their drink was spiked.  What we find after a toxicology screen is typically no evidence of any of the date rape drugs but rather a very large amount of alcohol.   What happens is that people lose count of the number of drinks but they've had and when they are more intoxicated than they expect, they blame a date rape drug that never existed. \n\n I expect a similar phenomenon is happening here. Simply put, the nights that involve both cigarettes and alcohol are probably nights with a greater amount of drinking or staying up later or partying harder in general.  Could nicotine and alcohol have some synergistic effect leading to a greater hangover? Sure it's entirely possible.  However this phenomenon is likely not well studied, well understood, and most importantly is likely far overshadowed by the social factors associated with combining the two as discussed above. \n\nEDIT: there are only two papers on all of PubMed that result from search terms \"nicotine alcohol hangover\". One is totally irrelevant. The other is almost totally irrelevant. Here is a link to that second one: _URL_0_ .  Terms \"alcohol cigarettes hangover \" produced one paper on marijuana, \"ethanol cigarettes hangover\" got no hits. \n\nPoint being, no real data."}]}

{"id": "3h8ejt", "input": "Why is the TV show \"Scrubs\" considered to be one of the most accurate medical themed shows?", "output": [{"answer": "Check out some YouTube videos by **Jim Kwik--founder of _URL_1_**.  He's excellent at teaching memory skills, and even the podcasts where he's interviewed ([School of Greatness](_URL_2_) or [Underground Wellness](_URL_0_)), he explains very interesting concepts and tricks that anyone can use.   \n\nThe very first thing to do if you want to get better at remembering names is to stop telling yourself \"I'm horrible at remembering names\", because your mind will believe it.  Rather, tell yourself, \"I used to be bad at remembering names, but now I'm getting better and better\".  Your self-talk is very important.    \n\nA trick Jim Kwik gives to help you remember is the analogy **\"M.O.M.\"**    \n\n**M - Motivation**.  If we were in a room of 50 people, and I told you that I will introduce each person to you [i]once[/i], and if after an hour, I will give you $1,000 for each person's name you remember, and if you remember all 50 names, I'll give you a bonus $50,000.  I think you would agree that you will have a strong motivation to remember everyone's name and you probably will too.    \n\n**O - Observation**.  If you were to try to remember these names, you might come up with some analogy or trick to remember their name.  For example, you meet Eric.  Maybe Eric looks just like your co-worker with the same name.  Or you meet an Indian guy named Ajit. Being a new name to you, you might ask how he spells it (but you wouldn't ask Tom or Paul how they spell their name), and you might also ask what does their name mean (\"invincible\" or \"he who has not been conquered in Sanskrit). Or you might ask how they were named that (after their parents' favorite movie star, or a beloved relative, etc...  People might appreciate this because it's not often asked.    \n\n**M - Mechanics**.  This one is essentially a method that you find easy to remember.  For example, if you remember visualization, maybe visualize meeting Bob bobbing up and down in the ocean.  Or maybe associations work for you (Rebecca has red hair. Rebecca redhead).  Of course, the sillier the better, but maybe keep some of the more potentially offensive ones to yourself.\n\nAfter a while, you get better at it and don't need to concentrate so hard.\n\nJim Kwik also has another analogy - **BE SUAVE**, which to cover briefly, stands for:    \n\n**Believe** - Believe you can be good at remembering names    \n**Exercise** - Practice these methods    \n**Say the name** - \"Nice to meet you, Sandra!\"    \n**Use it** - Use it in your conversation, but sparingly. Don't say their name too many times, that's just weird.    \n**Ask about it** - \"Ajit? That's a unique name, what does it mean? How did you get your name?    \n**Visualize** - Bob bobbing in the ocean.    \n**End by saying their name** - \"Thanks again, Lucy, it was nice to meet you!\"    \n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask someone for their name.  If I forget, I might say, \"Sorry, can you tell me your name again?\".  This is received so much better than you never saying their name, especially if it's clear you don't remember, because that shows you don't care.  But if you ask for their name again, it shows you care, and they'll appreciate it.\n\n(Edit: formatting)"}]}

{"id": "5sfbc0", "input": "How native americans lost so much of their territory so quickly to colonists", "output": [{"answer": "NFL? So the NFL is split into the NFC and the AFC. They both have 16 teams of their own. Each of these conferences are split into 4 groups of 4 called divisions. So there are 4 divisions per conference: North, South, East and West. Teams play other teams in their division twice a year, while they will only play other teams at most once a year. Wins against another conference team matter more than wins against teams from outside the conference in the case of a tiebreaker situation. There are 16 games a season and so there are 6 within the division, 4 against all the teams of a specific NFC conference, 4 against a specific AFC conference and then 2 more games against other teams in your conference. At the end of the season the teams that have the most wins in their division(or win in the case of a tiebreaker but I'll get to that) go to the playoffs. So that's 8 teams already. Now on top of that 2 teams from each Conference also get in as Wild Cards. This goes to the two teams with the most wins in each conference that weren't the best in their division (again if they have the same win/loss record as another team it goes to a tiebreaker to see who gets in). So now there are a total of 12 teams that made it to the playoffs. Now the teams in each conference play each other until one is the NFC champion and one is the AFC champion, and those two teams play in the Super Bowl. Before the conference championship, the teams are seeded. Of the 4 teams that were best in their division, they get ranked from 1 to 4 based on number of wins. Then the wild cards get ranked 5th or 6th based on number of wins. The 1 and 2 seed get a bye round, so they don't play anyone in the first round. The 3rd seed plays the 6th seed and the 4th seed plays the 5th seed. I should mention the higher seeded team always plays at home. After this the losers are eliminated and then the winners go onto the next round. The worst team left plays the 1st seed and the second worst seeded team plays the 2nd seed. After this game the two teams left in the conference play against each other for the conference championship.

Can odor get \"Spent\"?", "output": [{"answer": "Back at the very start of oil refining, people used a rather primitive process to distill what they wanted out of the oil. Back then, that was kerosene - a heavier fuel that was easily seperated, and was great for things like lamp oil! The lighter gasoline was a waste product - they didn't need it, and burned it off.  \n\nThen combustion engines came along - and combustion engines run best on lighter fuels - like gasoline! Which was great, since oil was in the ground already, and the industry to extract it was growing. Shortly after, better processes were invented to make gasoline for the growing automotive sector, and more and more oil wells.  \n\nGas-powered cars have existed for a while, but using a gas is just more dangerous and inconvenient, especially for personal vehicles. And back then, when combustion engines were only just developing, agriculture industry obviously didn't have any of the modern farming vehicles they have today, meaning it was a bit of a crazy idea to try and burn your food oils to go power your car, when you can just refine crude oil. It's only with the relatively recent advent of global warming and the growing scarcity of oil that we've began to consider them as viable alternatives.  \n\nTo put it shortly, oil was just conveniently available as a light, volatile liquid, compared to anything else they had at the time."}]}

The very first portable computers ran on lead-acid batteries.  Now we have lithium ion batteries, which have about 4 times the capacity (by weight).\n\nOther improvements have helped too - we have made much smaller transistors, which consume a lot less power...  An \"old\" portable computer could run for maybe an hour.  Your \"new\" cell phone can do an hour's-worth of the same computations in less than a second now.  The battery-to-work ratio is probably hundreds of thousands of times better than it was in the 90s.\n\nThe competing factor, the thing that \"fights\" our battery power, is customer expectations.  Your computer has *numerous* extra features that kill battery life, from a display that is has 16 times as many pixels with 4 times more colors (that's 64 times more computation), to multiple modes of wireless connectivity.\n\nThere are computers out there that have a battery that will 20 hours or more - but people rarely buy them.  They are hundreds of times more powerful than early computers, but still not \"modern enough\".\n\nSo, customers have struck a balance.  The most popular products have reasonably good computation power, as well as a battery life that is good but not awesome or impractical.\n\nThere are some \"next big steps\" in battery life, including lower-power processors and high-capacity / quick-charge batteries.  They will probably be appearing in laptops in the next 3 or 4 years.\n\nAddendum: Per comments, lithium batteries have been around for a long time, but didn't regularly appear in laptops until around 2000.  Also, computation, while it does consume power, is usually not the major consumer of battery power; nothing is - it's a combination of backlights, fans, computations, wireless radios, I/O, etc."}]}

If you're a tourist, and the price to get to say, Miami, is too high, you will go somewhere else for your vacation instead, or you will wait and fly to Miami at another time.  If you're a business traveler, and you have to be in Chicago for a 9 AM meeting on Monday, then you have to be there, period, and you'll pay whatever it costs.\n\nSo a lot of the airlines' rules on round-trip tickets are designed to get more money from business travelers and give discounts to tourists.  That's why they give discounts for a round-trip including a saturday night stopover or an advance purchase - which are likely to be tourists, but not for last minute purchases or very short weekday stays - which are likely to be business travelers who are willing to pay more.\n\nIf airlines allowed cheap one-way tickets, that would let you get around their whole complicated pricing rules designed to make business travelers pay more.  That's why they discount round-trips and not one-ways.\n\nHowever, that is changing.  When airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet in Europe, and Southwest and Jet Blue in the US started offering cheap one-way tickets, that forced the regular airlines to change their pricing somewhat.  It used to be much worse - you might see a one-way ticket for $800 and a round-trip for $300.  Now even the regular airlines offer one ways at a relatively reasonable price."}]}

A simple explanation for asthma is a condition in which the airway to the lungs narrows and becomes clogged with a mucus that, if not treated, may completely close the airway and prevent the individual from breathing. Why does the mucus appear, you ask? Everybody's body can produce this mucus, and can do so if the lung becomes infected or the body thinks something is trying to attack the lungs. The mucus acts as a barrier to prevent further damage. However, with asthmatics, the lungs tend to glitch out and occasionally think that they're being attacked when actually, the asthmatic may just be exercising or whatnot. Because the lungs think something's wrong, this mucus will occur and cause the individual some discomfort, or as we say \"my asthma is acting up.\"\n\nWhen you hear someone say \"my asthma is acting up,\" they're probably referring to wheeziness, pressure on the chest, coughing, lung pain, or a shortness of breath. \n\nEverybody's asthma is triggered differently, but primary culprits are exercise, pollen, smog, stress, change in temperature, extreme temperatures, dry/humid weather, and so many more. What triggers one asthmatic's asthma to act up could not affect another asthmatic at all, so it really depends. \n\nOccasionally, people grow out of their asthma. This is usually the case in teenagers who had asthma in their childhood. Along with all the other changes that happen to their body during puberty, the asthma \"glitch\" can simply fade away."}]}
{"id": "59ni0w", "input": "How do we decide what is a war crime and what is not?", "output": [{"answer": "3 ways (predominantly):\n1. The cancer cells themselves: cancer cells (malignant ones) are incredibly resource-intensive. The worst parasite you can imagine. They gobble up all your body\u2019s nutrients (i.e. glucose - which is actually how a PET scan detects cancer, by seeing which cells are \u201ceating\u201d the most glucose). There\u2019s no way you can keep up; you\u2019re literally being starved from the inside out. Couple that with metastatic cancer (when pieces break off and latch somewhere else), and you\u2019ve got multiple parasitic growths. And boy do they grow. So even if you cut out one of the tumors, they\u2019ve already seeded elsewhere.\n\n2. The cancer cells as a \u201cmass\u201d: most evident for solid tumors, not only are they eating your resources, but their growth will invade nearby tissues. A big enough lung cancer will grow into your trachea, and you die. A big enough colon cancer will perforate your bowel. And you die. Really sad story of a patient who has a cancer of the neck, wrapping around the carotid artery; inoperable (ie the operation would kill them), and it\u2019s just slowly growing. One day, without warning, the cancer growth will rupture the carotid artery. And...you get the picture.\n\n3. Leukemia/lymphoma as immunosuppressants: cancers of the blood especially put patients at risk of immunosuppression - that is, only mutated, cloned and non-functioning immune cells are created. The patient is basically left with a very weak immune system, leaving them vulnerable to some quite dangerous bacteria, viruses and fungi that we would otherwise be able to fight off but can in themselves bring about the demise of a patient\n\nBonus way: cancer cells are incredibly thombophillic (\u201cpertaining to the love of clots\u201d), meaning they can create blood clots that shoot off into your lungs or heart.

The haze would be strongest immediately around the cable, and quickly diminish as it gets further around. This haze wouldn't move around like smoke, but it is affected by other objects. For example the haze goes through wood undisturbed, but it would flatten out when it hits certain metals. It may even seem to stretch out to the metal if it is grounded. It is also affected by other nearby fields, so may squish if there is another cable nearby. \n\nIt's not just around cables. There would be a haze around your wifi router, and really dense hazes around cell phone towers, as well as TV and radio broadcast towers. These hazes also diminish with distance, but there are so many you will see a bit of a haze everywhere you go. It only really disappears if you are in a room surrounded by a grounded wire mesh (a Faraday cage or shielded room). (Edit: you may also see interference patterns if they are at the same frequencies. This will be especially noticeable on wifi routers with multiple antennas. The interference will cause beams of haze to form.)\n\nThere's actually two types of hazes, one electric (say bluish) and one magnetic (perhaps reddish). So you'd see a red haze around something magnetic, and a blue haze coming off your finger just before you get shocked by the metal door handle. Most electrical objects will have both kinds of hazes to varying degrees. And some are shielded a bit to prevent interference, but you might see some haze leaking out of buttons and knobs. An interesting effect, though is that plugged in cords will have a blue haze when the device is off, then add a red haze when the device is on. \n\nYou won't be able to see this, but the hazes will be pulsing. The electrical cables will pulse in and out at 100 or 120 times a second (they change polarity so it's twice the mains frequency). This will be too fast for you to see (unless you're a member of /r/pcmasterrace), and happens around radio antennas many times faster than that. (Edit: you'll probably be able to see a red pulsation around electrical motors, though, if they are running slow enough.)\n\nThe fields also have directionality. So you see a sort of swirl to them, going around the haze. It will change direction too fast to see on electrical wires, but on magnets it will be obvious, as well as on your body as you charge up from shuffling across the carpet. \n\nThis is effectively what you see when you look at the Northern lights. Charged particles from the sun are riding down Earth's magnetic field lines until they hit the atmosphere, causing the molecules to glow from impacts."}]}

Hopefully you'll at least see it, even if many others won't at this stage of the thread.\n\nControl of the inflation rate through monetary policy.\n\nYou see, the central bank for many industrial nations adjust the available money to target some small, steady loss of purchasing power. This is for the benefit of the borrowers, of which the government is the biggest but also entrepreneurs. Paying off loans that steadily become less of a burden due to inflation is much easier to plan for than paying off loans that may become much harder to pay off due to deflation. \n\nHowever, as you point out, technology should be increasing efficiency and creating a steady, or even sudden and significant gains in purchasing power when aggregated across the entire marketplace over say 20-30 years. We should be able to purchase more with less and thus work less.\n\nThe problem is that they compute the inflation rate after these market gains are priced in. They look at a basket of prices for things in a wide range of industries so as to best estimate the true inflation or deflation and create money or destroy money to counterbalance things. \n\nSo, if in one particular year the market sees an increase in efficiency in enough industries to make things 3% cheaper, the central bank still targets a 2% increase in prices and prints enough money to achieve that, cancelling out the 3% efficiency gain due to technology while also taking 2% more of our purchasing power away to boot. \n\nThis process is very slow and should only be thought of as why 30 years of progress has seen no better pay for workers, considering inflation, while CEO pay has gone up over 300%."}]}

(a word derived from the Caucasus mountain region of Central Asia)", "output": [{"answer": "**TL;DR: new technologies will be stylistically expressed to the max, but once it's overdone, it will be reacted to.**\n\nVisual style pretty much boils down to an interaction between a product, the technology it's created with, and the culture within which it's created.\n\nSo, in the case of Mac OS: when OS X first came out, the \"shiny\" look was really pushing the technology. The \"shininess\" was made possible by a technology Apple created called Quartz (built upon OpenGL), that allowed interface elements to be path-based shapes and shadows, rendered in device-independent subpixel precision (essentially, PDF).\n\nThe predecessor to Mac OS X was built with QuickDraw technology. Interface elements were drawn with raster graphics, simply represented by solid pixels. The \"Aqua\" look of OS X simply wasn't possible with this technology.\n\nSo, this new technology interacted with the cultural factors that: 1) user interfaces are an alternate reality (we use metaphors such as \"desktop\" and \"window\"), and 2) previous user interfaces looked blocky and simple. This resulted in an interface look that was a sort of hyper-reality, and was as much of a departure from previous interfaces as possible. As Steve Jobs put it, \"one of the design goals was when you saw it, you wanted to lick it.\"\n\nNow, of course, everyone has tried to emulate Apple's Aqua interface, and the technology that makes it possible has become more widespread. It's no longer novel to have an interface that is \"hyper-real.\" So, more tactile textures are making their way into interfaces.\n\n\nAnother good example of these factors at work would be the shift from Neoclassicism to Impressionism in 19th century painting. Impressionism's characteristics (\"slice-of-life\" subject matter and visible brush strokes) was a reaction to Neoclassicism (classical subject matter and photorealism). Additionally, the advent of photography inspired the more spontaneous compositions of Impressionisms, and created pressure for painters to \"innovate\" beyond photorealism.\n\nSources: Chapter 4 of my book, [Design for Hackers](_URL_14_)"}]}

What the rest of the computer (CPU, software, video card, etc.) does is process data in the way it's been told to by the programmer or hardware designer.  Then, an instruction from software (such as, say, iTunes) says \"send this data to the speakers\".  The software doesn't need to know how to make that data come out as sound because the hardware designers made the speakers know how to do that.\n\nEDIT: Also, there are protocols set up such that a sequence of data at the start of a file lets software know what kind of file it is.  So '1111' might mean it's an audio file, '1110' video, '1101' a picture, etc."}]}

{"id": "74kvwg", "input": "Why do we need to use polygons in video games? What causes us to need flat polygons rather than simply having rounded shapes?", "output": [{"answer": "The simple answer is that it's complicated.\n\nHistorically, the pace of automation has been slow enough and coincided with other advances so that as jobs were lost in one field, workers could move to other fields. Improvements of all sorts on farms let to a drop in agricultural employment, but those people tended to just move to cities to start working in factories.\n\nToday, however, agricultural advances in developing nations have led to mass migration into cities which do not have enough jobs for everyone. This is due to a whole mess of reasons, but it is not the relatively smooth transition from rural agriculture to urban manufacturing that the West saw awhile ago. Some of this is due to modern manufacturing not needing as many people to keep up production.\n\nA lot of modern industries now also require a significant amount of education. So as they get replaced in their old field, it's hard to easily move to a new field. This may be a generational problem though, as a new generation goes through school, they can just be trained for the new fields instead. We might also get better about retraining people.\n\nWhile automated systems do need maintenance, generally speaking, the people who used to do that job don't have the skills to become robot repairmen. But labor has it's own supply and demand curves, so larger numbers of unemployed workers modifies the price in other fields. More people looking for jobs means lower wages, cheaper labor discourages automation. So far, we've pretty much always found something else for those workers to do. It's an open question whether the modern pace of automation is going to present a problem for that."}]}

When hair grows out of your follicles, it will keep its pigments forever. When you get old, your hair follicles have trouble producing these pigments. So as your hair grows out, the new hair is simply grown without pigment, therefore grey.\n\n\nQuick edit to try my hand at really ELI5:\nYou have little hair factories on your body that always are pushing out hair, bit by bit making your hair longer. The factory paints the hair as it goes out, but when you get old, they run out of paint! So the stuff that is already painted stays painted, but the new stuff is just unpainted grey.

{"id": "3d9dos", "input": "How does New Horizons avoid space debris for 9 years and three billion miles?", "output": [{"answer": "One team bats while the other team bowls and fields. The team which is bowling tries to get all of the batsmen \"out\" in one of several ways:\n\n* Caught (the batsman hits the ball with his bat or hand, and one of the fielders catches it before it touches the ground)\n* Bowled (the bowler manages to knock the bails from the stumps - the stumps are three sticks in the ground and the bails are two smaller sticks which balance on top of them.)\n* LBW (The ball hits the batsman on the leg, and the umpire decides that it *would* have knocked the bails from the stumps if he hadn't got in the way)\n* Hit Wicket (The batsman goes full retard and knocks the bails off himself)\n* Stumped/Run Out (The batsman leaves his crease after facing a delivery and the fielding team manages to knock the bails off with the ball before he can get back behind it. The crease is a line 1 yard in front of the stumps.)\n* Handled ball (The batsman deliberately plays the ball with his hand, usually to stop it rolling on to the stumps).\n\nThe batsman try to score as many 'runs' as they can before they get out. A run is scored by the two batsmen (there are always two on the pitch - one at each end) running down the pitch and swapping ends before the fielding team can run either of them out. You can score as many runs as you want at a time - if you can run from one end to the other 150 times without the fielding team managing to knock the bails off, then you would score 150 runs (although this would never happen).\n\nYou can also score boundaries. If you hit the ball over a rope which marks the edge of the field, you score either 6 runs (for clearing it without bouncing) or 4 runs.\n\nThe game is divided into 'overs'. An over is a period of 6 balls bowled by the same bowler from the same end of the pitch. He bowls at whichever batsman happens to be standing at that end of the pitch at the time (which can change from ball to ball if they score an odd number of runs from a shot). At the end of an over, another bowler takes over and bowls an over from the opposite end of the pitch.\n\nThe difference between the forms of the game is:\n\n* Test Cricket - the classic form of the game. Each side has two batting innings, and whoever scores the most runs after all of the opponents have been given 'out' in both innings wins. If 5 days passes without anybody having won (remember - to win you have to bowl the opposing team out twice and score more runs than they did in total) then the game is a draw.\n\n* Limited overs (One Day) cricket. This is where a result is forced by having each team play one innings of a set number of overs, and whoever has the most runs after both teams have batted wins. Simple as that. The two forms of limited over international cricket are ODIs, which are 50 overs per side, and T20, which is 20 overs per side.\n\nIn test cricket, the batsmen are much more cautious, because it's more important not to get out than it is to score quickly. In limited overs games, you simply have to score quickly to win, so it's much more acceptable to take risks and play shots which could get you out. The opposite is true for bowlers - in test matches, it is far more important for them to take wickets than anything else, so they can take risks with where the fielders stand and the types of delivery they bowl to make it more likely that if a batsmen makes a mistake you will get him out, but if he doesn't there will be lots of gaps for him to hit the ball to and score runs. In limited overs games, they really are more interested in stopping the batsman scoring than anything else."}]}

If necessary, they can and will use equipment normally meant for military units if it's needed in the carrying out of their duties.\n\nThe national guard in the US is a bit of a separate entity, technically they are state militias that act as an army reserve.

Fingerprint systems where created back the days when fingerprints where searched manually in books.\n\nFor a moment think about searching for a face. You have a million mugshots and you want someone (without a computer) to search for one that matchs a particular suspect. So you start classifying the features of the face: What color is the skin, is the nose flat or pointy, is the head oval, rectangular, triangular, are the lips thin or thick and so on. You give a letter or number to each of those features so that it creates a code, like WO7SK. Now there will be hundreds of faces that are identified as WO7SK but it has narrowed down the search by a lot. If you organize your mugshots using this system (so you have a cabinet for codes starting with W, with a binder for codes starting with WO, etc) you can find someone with only a short search.\n\nThe same is done for fingerprints, originally with a paper system and now with computers. A fingerprint is identified as being in one of three categories, an arch, a loop or a whorl and then from there into one of several subcategories (like a tented arch or radial loop). Further features within the fingerprint like the number of ridges or the shape of a delta or core will further narrow down the classification. From there either a human or a computer can manually compare the fingerprint with others that match that classification."}]}

Also a lot of responses that are partially correct, and a lot that seem to me to be mostly misinformation. California faces a lot of complex and interconnected issues regarding wildfires and as a wildland firefighter from California I'd like to share my perspective.\n\nFirst, as others have pointed out, the entire Western U.S. can and will have large wildfires during the summer months. Most years fire season will start in late spring in the Southwest  and continue until the summer monsoons arrive around July or so. As summer progresses the potential for large fires expands northward into the Great Basin area and up into the Northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest by midsummer. By late summer/early fall temperatures begin to drop and storm systems coming in from the North Pacific tend to bring more precipitation to these areas, decreasing the potential for large fires. This is a VERY general pattern and is not always the case for all regions in all years. \n\nCalifornia is unique among Western states in that there is the potential for large damaging wildfires pretty much year-round. I think a large part of this has to do with geography and climate. California is a huge state with climates ranging from temperate rainforest in the Northwest to high altitude conifer forest in the Sierras to desert in the Southeast. Southern coastal California has a Mediterranean climate which is particularly conducive to fast moving brush fires. [This image](_URL_7_) shows just how diverse California's vegetation is. Different parts of the state burn at different times of the year and it seems like in recent years the summers have been hotter, drier, and longer leading to more late season fires like we are seeing now. When the winter rains do arrive, if they arrive at all, we get just enough to grow a good grass crop which then dries out and becomes highly flammable, carrying fire into the heavier fuel like brush and trees.\n\nAnother thing that some commenters have pointed out is California's issue with what's known as a the Wildland Urban Interface. As population centers expand into areas that were formerly uninhabited or mostly rural, fighting wildfire becomes much more complex because the strategies and tactics that are used to control or suppress fires in wilderness areas are often limited or made more complicated by the presence of homes and other private property. For example, in a wilderness area fire crews will often light a backfire to remove fuel ahead of the main fire. This can be a very effective technique, but it becomes much more complex if you have to worry about burning someone's house down in the process. Similarly, it is much easier to let a fire burn itself out while cleaning up dead fuels in an unpopulated area than it is in an area where properties are at risk. \n\nFinally, I'd like to touch on the issue of forest management. Like I said earlier, California has a HUGE range of vegetation types and each fuel model (the different types of vegetation that will fuel a wildfire) requires a different approach to management. As a federal employee I will be the first to agree that there are issues with the way our forests are managed. Having said that, you could literally write a college thesis analyzing the successes and failures of the U.S. Forest Service's management of federal lands in California (not to mention the rest of U.S.). In a nutshell, there is no one answer that will solve all the challenges facing the Forest Service when it comes to reducing the impact of wildfires. Forests are managed for timber sales, wildlife, recreation, wildfire, wilderness areas, cultural and archaeological sites, etc. and in my experience most national forests are severely underfunded and understaffed.  Most of the people that I have met in forest management positions are doing the best they can with what they have. Some of our forests are in great shape and are healthy and thriving. Others ([like this forest in the Sierra Nevadas](_URL_8_)) have been hit so hard by drought and/or disease that it almost seems like a lost cause. The point is that lots of people ARE trying their best to tackle these issues but it's hard to even put into words how challenging of a job it is."}]}

There is also the relationship among what is proven (Doping works but it is banned by most sports organizations), what people want to see (Records broken, championships won, and amazing feats), and what athletes have to do if they want to be elite (Train hard, be lucky/talented, and dope while not getting caught).\n\nThe sad truth is, Lance Armstrong probably doped a few times in his career, even if he passed all his drug tests. The nature of testing and doping in sports points to the likelihood that he did it, even if just a little, although what he used may have been legal or untested *at the time*. The problem is the general public hates being told this though. They want to believe in the pure, naturally gifted athlete who'd never stoop to doping. Doping is cheating in the eyes of the public. They don't want to know how records are set and broken, they want to see them happen.\n\nThe public perception is that doping is cheating, while the truth is much more complicated. Is it cheating? Yes but in a way, it's almost necessary just due to how widespread it is. Public demand for higher and higher levels of performance practically demand it. Armstrong, even if he had never cheated, won 7 Tour de France titles. Now that bar is set at 7. The chances of winning 8 is up to either a freakishly good, once in a generation cyclist doing it, or an extremely good one who's trainers know the testing/doping system, and gave him the extra edge to accomplish it. The truth people don't like is that the latter is far, far more likely to occur.\n\nSo the accusation that Armstrong is subject of a witchhunt is most likely overblown. The facts, if they ever come out, will probably not clarify much for people. If he doped, there's the chance he did it with an illegal substance and simply didn't test hot for it at the time. Or he used something which wasn't illegal at one point but is now, or he used one that wasn't tested for at the time of those particular tests. See how complicated all this can be? That's one reason why Armstrong decided to acquiesce. The investigation would've likely hurt a lot of people, not just because of the facts revealed, but because of the *perception* of those facts. He's likely protecting people he believes to be innocent. Or he's simply innocent and there's a small chance this really is a witchhunt. The truth is we'll probably never figure that out."}]}

How about something more in depth? Not only is your \"Password123\" not very random, neither is \"Hgafyvz1086\".\n\nBoth are 11 characters long, and they're both printable characters, limited to letters and numbers. If you look on an ASCII/UTF-8 encoding table, you'll see that each character is stored in computer memory as an 8-bit byte with a decimal value between 48-57 (characters '0' through '9'), 65-90 ('A' through 'Z'), and 97-122 ('a' through 'z').\n\nThat's 62 possible different byte values for any character in your password. Your passwords are 8 bits x 11 characters = 88 bits long, which can represent an integer between 0 - >  309485009821345068724781055, but because of your limited number of characters, your not using all the possible bits in each byte. The most significant bit is always 0, so we only need to contemplate 7 of the 8 bits. Your whole password represents an integer between 58256001848723777642311728 - >  148067338032172934840875642. That's a mere 89811336183449157198563914 different values. But since we're only using 10 digits, 26 lowercase letters, and 26 uppercase letters, only \"characters^number_of_characters\" = (10+26+26)^11 = 62^11 = 285,311,670,611 of those values in that range can actually be represented by your password complexity. THAT'S PEANUTS for a computer.\n\nAn attacker can make grand assumptions about password complexity. If you're going to type it in from your keyboard, even using punctuation, it doesn't increase the number of possible passwords that much. The number of possible passwords they have to attack becomes limited.\n\nThere are two ways to harden your password from attack: use non-printable characters, and use longer passwords.\n\nByte values 0-31 and 127 are control characters, they don't have a printed representation and (mostly) can't be typed into a keyboard directly. Then there's Extended ASCII; that 8th bit adds 127 more values.\n\nThe thing with binary is every additional bit doubles the number of possibilities, and each additional character in your password adds 8 at a time.\n\nThe thing about these rainbow tables is they're HUGE. Terabytes, exabytes. And they take a long time to generate. Your goal is to ensure your password doesn't end up in this table, and their goal is to generate the smallest table that gets the biggest bang for their buck. If an attacker doesn't care about breaking every single password, they're going to take every shortcut they can. If they can skip non-printable characters, you only need one, and you've beaten them. But it's easier to produce tables for every combination than it is for ever increasing combinations. Like I said, every additional bit doubles the size of their rainbow table. Typical tables are generated for up to 32 characters, the big ones go up to 64. If your password is 33 or 65 characters, it's not in their table.\n\nIt's easy to make a long password, just take a passage from a book or a poem, something easy to remember.\n\nBut it gets even easier and better than that. Use a keyring program. It uses a master password to protect a locally encrypted file. That file contains the passwords to all your things. These programs can be given a set of password criteria, and they will generate passwords for you, printable and not, with whatever rules, and up to the maximum length. All they're going to do is random-ish-but-with-rules some very large integer, because that's all your password is, in the end. These programs will put your password in your clipboard so you never have to know it or see it, so you can just paste right into the password field. Even Windows, Linux, and OSX have features where the clipboard will wipe itself after a paste, and it will refuse to paste in plain-text, so you can never actually see it on screen. Put the software and the file on a thumb drive, and plug it in only when you need a password - just like you wouldn't leave your keys in the ignition when not in use. So you only need to know one easy password and all the rest are managed."}]}

But the study is still out as to how much that transfers over to other aspects of life.\n\nDon't trust all those brain games or websites that claim to boost memory/processing skills/sharpness/whatever. Luminosity found themselves in a multi-million dollar lawsuit due to those unfounded claims.\n\nSudoku, crosswords, reading, etc. are good for keeping the brain active. Deduction puzzles, visuospacial puzzles/activities, crafts, logic games, strategy games... They're all better than sitting there and doing nothing with your brain all day. I would choose a strategy game that requires some thinking over a hack and slash first person shooter (not that those aren't entertaining!)\n\nI doubt that your experience will be lessened by playing a strategy game on the computer versus flipping the actual physical cards.\n\nSo in a sense, all these activities are good because you're forcing the brain to work a bit.   And if you enjoy it as well, double bonus!\n\nBut as I briefly touched upon and as /u/EudaimoniaWC mentioned, the effects of such games on the \"neuroplasticity\" on the brain to keep it healthy/sharp/etc is still not known. I think there may be some carryover with functional activities we enjoy, but just playing a game or two of Brain Age will not stave off my ADHD and \"fix\" my concentration, for example. It's just not as simple as all those brain game sites try to claim.\n\nKeep doing enjoyable activities that make you think. But even better, keep learning new things! A new language, a new craft, a new game or recipe. Learning a new task builds new neural pathways in the brain and keeps it more flexible, compared to doing the same routine things over and over. The best way to keep a brain active and engaged is to create new paths, not stay in the same ruts. Don't worry about \"neuroplasticity\" so much, chances are that you are fine. If you want to exercise your brain, challenge it by learning a new task."}]}

The frequency (how close together) and amplitude (the size) of these waves make different sounds.\n\nA speaker creates pressure waves by moving a cone back and forth.  By moving at different speeds and over different distances, it creates waves of specific frequencies and amplitude.  The cone of the speaker has a magnet attached to it.  Near that magnet inside the speaker housing is a coil of wire.  When electricity is run through the coil of wire the magnet gets pulled toward the coil.  When the electricity in the coil stops, the magnet springs away from the coil due to the shape of the speaker cone.  Running electricity through the coil at differing frequencies and for differing durations cause the speaker cone to move sound waves at various frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nHeadphones usually have very small speaker cones and very small magnets.  Because of this, they are usually not very good at creating low frequency sound waves."}]}

Not everything in grammar is logical; it's a function of everyday usage. The \"locative adverb\" explanation could technically be correct if you simply made up a new adverb where the noun \"home\" used to be. In which case \"home\" would be a shortened substitution for the locative adverb \"homeward.\" But then you could do that with \"school\", too.\n\nNo, the simple answer is that home is the most common place to go, so we've shortened it and done away with the pronoun \"to\" (or, alternately, the adverbial \"ward\".)

But someone will have to ELI5 it, cause I have no idea what it says:\n\n\"In October 2014 and February 2015, the headline indexes came down and breached the 200 day moving average and 12 month moving average, those are critical support levels beneath which big trouble arises, as was seen this past Friday. Bullard and Fisher both saved the day on each of those days by jumping on the mic and saying the FOMC will maintain 0% interest rates and even reinstate QE3 if necessary, effectively promising to backstop traders against any losses and the markets turned green and never looked back. I remember it well because I was shorting the market on those days and both Fisher and Bullard cost me a shit ton of money with their jawboning. However, this past Friday, most traders expected a bounce after the heavy selling on heavy volume all week, but Bullard got on the mic this time and did the opposite of his usual antics, he did not promise liquidity assistance nor 0% interest, instead he promoted a rate increase, he pulled the backstop away from traders during their worst hour.\n\nIt is hysterical on so many levels because Bullard and Fisher have been pumping markets with these speeches for years and now they turned their backs on traders and forced them to absorb losses and allowed the volatility index to float its biggest weekly gain ever in financial history.\n\nOn to China...\n\nThe benchmark SSEC index is down around 45% off its June high. Since the June high, the PBOC and Chinese government have tried to stop the selling by criminalizing short selling, cutting interest rates, nationalizing stocks (Yes, there is actually a bureau of stocks now in the Chinese Government), and devaluing the Yuan by 4%, which is the greatest devaluation in 20 years, in an effort to stop selling. None of it worked.\n\nChinese officials then instructed mainland hedge funds to toe the 200 day moving average at any cost. They did so and managed to hold the 200 day moving average 5 times over the last 7 weeks. The market has barely hung on to the 200 day moving average as Communist leaders threatened fund managers if they should fail the 200 day MA...\n\nDespite the central bank's best efforts and the government interference and threats...The SSEC finally lost the 200 day moving average in glorious fashion on Thursday night. The loss of the 200 day MA despite this much interference and pumping by the central bank speaks volumes about the fact the China has completely lost control over the inflated stock market run that the central bank fueled.\n\nWall Street is hoping that this weekend China provides further stimulus to stem the losses on the SSEC and other Chinese indexes on Monday, but judging by the ineffectiveness of all the ongoing easing measures, it isnt going to work. There is nothing China can do to stop the selling at this point, this is what is meant by a central bank losing control, they become powerless to stop natural market forces from emerging, a fact that has become painfully obvious in China and will soon become painfully obvious for U.S. equities.\n\nI also see on a technical basis, the benchmark U.S. indexes are just getting started to the downside. Monday morning will be a red open, how much red is the only question. Dip buyers will likely emerge and they will likely be slaughtered upon on entry, as markets sucker in dumb money while smart money has already left the party. Markets prefer the path of maximum devastation. Charts suggest heavy selling pressure is on deck for the coming weeks and months and the S & P 500 ended the 6 year bull run at its peak value of 2135, it will not reach that price again for many many years, even if the FED reinstates QE3, it will not breach this peak level.\n\nIt is overwhelmingly obvious that the smart money has already left the party, only inexperienced retailers will buy this market now. Google accumulation-distribution and McCllellan oscillator. We have been watching distribution from smart money to dumb money all year as the A-D trend has been down for 10 months, it was the opposite during QE3, smart money bought stocks with both hands during that time. Now when I leave my house, I hear all this excitement amongst the masses that there is a buying opportunity. Oh my, how Wall Street is fucking genius like that. The retailers are dead on the weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Every good bull run needs bagholders.\""}]}

What people call \"suction\" is the pressure of something trying to rush into somewhere where there's less pressure.  It's a pushing force.\n\nWe don't notice it but the atmosphere around us (and our body) are at a set pushing pressure all the time (called \"1 atmosphere\" for most places).   We're so used to it we don't notice it.   So when there's somewhere that has less than 1 atmosphere of pushing (like the inside of a vacuum cleaner) the air nearby tries to push itself in and it looks to us like a \"suck\" but it's just the air pushing itself into the place of low pressure.    To make it more confusing, if you stick your hand over the end, you'll feel your skin being \"pulled\" in to the vacuum cleaner.   But again!  nothing is actually pulling, it's the normal pressure _in your body_ trying to move into a place where there's less pressure, so part of your flesh and blood is forced by the pressure in your body to protrude a bit more into the vacuum tube until the tension of your skin won't let it go any further.\n\nSimilar thing happening when you \"suck\" on a straw.   There is no pulling involved.   Your lungs push out which makes the air in your lungs and mouth push out at less than \"1 atmosphere\" of pushing, this makes the air in the straw push out less too.   This means the atmosphere pushing down on the surface of the drink is now pushing more than the air in the straw and the result is that the drink is pushed into the straw!\n\nSuper counter-intuitive!"}]}

There have been many advances in these fields, and while many would have you believe that we simply do not have the tech to harvest a sufficient amount of this energy to power our society, this simply is not the case. \n\nA fundamental truth about our energy grid is that every bit of power that is used by commercial, government, or residential use is generated moments before it is used. Keep this in mind; it is like water pressure. In order to squeeze out water where it is needed, pressure at the source must be maintained. Same concept with electricity, except the pressure is equalized much faster.\n\nSo with a continuous energy grid, we are able to call on power at any moment, and any alternative energy source must have this ability when competing with gas turbines. Wind and solar energies are unable to provide this due to fundamental inconsistencies in power availability, (clouds, low wind, night time.)\n\nSo the obvious answer is, store the power! If we can generate more than is needed at any given moment, we should be able to store it, right? \n\nThe answer is: Well, sort of. The first thought was to use batteries, but any battery used to store energy grid level power would need to be able to survive continuous charge and discharge, and our current battery technology just isn't there *quite* yet. I'm actually working on a project to develop a battery that would overcome this obstacle, but it is still in prototyping. Check out Ambri for more info on that!\n\nDespite the fact that batteries aren't a commercially feasible option yet, clean energy has found some ways to store this energy (albeit at a much lower efficiency than batteries would have.) when excess power is pumped into the grid, they use it to pump water uphill, storing the energy as potential energy in the water. Then, when extra energy is needed in the grid, they let the water flow back down the hill through a hydroelectric turbine that produces the needed power. This is just the first storage option that came to mind that is being used today to energize (pun there don't care) the clean energy market. \n\n**TL;DR**: Inconsistent power generation by clean energy options needs cheap, reliable storage that we just haven't developed quite yet.

The blocks have to be layed one at a time by hand and the material between the blocks is placed by a trowel just before the block is placed. The growth in efficiency is due to using machines to move the block to the work site of the brick layer.

The kids that did it weren't particularly smart about it, and though the police were less than useless, I eventually through my own investigation, found the culprit, his brother and girlfriend who were all involved.\n\nThey really did a number on my stuff. Not only did they take things but they destroyed a bunch of stuff as well. Really nasty mean kind of behavior.\n\nI had Marvel comic cards, still in the package that were close to 20 years old... I found the empty wrappers on the floor. \n\nThey took my entire comic collection... thousands of comics dating back to when I was 11 years old.\n\nThey went through and read my journals, looked through and tossed tore or otherwise discarded my drawings, etc...\n\nThey took the covers off of the really nice couch my Grandmother gave me to use as bags to carry my stuff away.\n\nSwords and knives... books, video games, movies, nearly the whole of my physical possessions... or at least the ones that meant something too me.\n\nThey even went through the fridge.\n\nSo anyway... after getting arressted, they were sentenced to pay me restitution for the damage and stolen items.\n\nMonths went by and eventually I received a check for $80.00\n\nI waited a while longer, but never heard anything else from the court and no more money arrived.\n\nSo... just like with finding the little creeps, I took things into my own hands, and began calling his probation officer. Regularly, about once every two weeks.\n\nThe probation officer never had much to say, tried to blow me off and I never felt that he had my interests in mind in any way, but I was relentless. I called and called and called...\n\nThen one day I got a notice that the kid had a new court date for failure to pay the restitution.\n\nI showed up to court, and was addressed by the judge to tell my part of the story. I told him how I'd been violated by this punk... how he'd read love letters that had been sent to me by past girlfriends, how callous they'd been towards my belongings.\n\nHe was sentenced to a restitution home where they make you work a 40 hour week, and 80% of what they make is supposed to go towards, paying off their debt.\n\nHe was in the home for maybe a month... and I get this part of the story from a friend of the kid's family... his grandmother paid off the whole debt so that he could get out of the home. Which was fortunate for me, but disappointing in that the kid wasn't punished accordingly.... however...Not long after I got a check in the mail for $5300\n\nI gave my boss the finger, bought some sign making equipment and I've been self employed now for over 13 years.\n\nOnce in a while I'll think of something that I used to own, and wonder if it might be in my attic or otherwise in storage and I'll remember that it's gone and I'll feel the anger and hurt again, as if it was just yesterday. \n\nI heard later on that the kid was abused by his older brother, and that the brother was the instigator of all the theivery. The kid was maybe, autistic or in some way outside of the spectrum of normality in the realm of intelligence.

In a vehicle, a clutch is used to separate the engine from the transmission for a few purposes like gear changes and starting the damned thing.\n\nWhy do we even *need* a clutch? To protect the transmission and (at times) the engine. When you're just driving around, the clutch is pressed against the flywheel of your engine and locked up onto it. This allows the engine and transmission to work as one unit, they're both physically linked to each other. Step on the gas and you go. Easy.\n\nWith the clutch in, you step on the gas and the engine roars but you go nowhere. Why? The engine is disconnected from the transmission due to the clutch being disengaged.\n\nThis is where things get tricky. Say you need to shift gears because you want to go faster. You press in the clutch and shift, then let the clutch out. What you did is separate the engine from the transmission, to unload the engine torque from the transmission. This allows an easier shift, and keeps your transmissions synchronizers happy. The synchronizers actually do all the work, you're not moving gears around so much as you're moving synchros around to *engage* the gear. If you didn't have the clutch in, you'd hear a loud grind or a buzz. That's your synchronizer getting beaten up a little. This is bad and significantly reduces the operational life of the transmission. Synchronizers aren't designed to work without a clutch, they can't be exposed to the power of the engine.\n\nNow, when you press the clutch pedal in, you're actually moving the clutch *away* from the flywheel. The clutch has friction material - similar to brake pads, that allow it to do this frequently. The flyweel is similar to a disc brake, but a little thinner. When the clutch is disengaged, the engine and transmission operate independently. You can be going 150mph and your engine will be idling. Now if you were going 150mph while in gear, your engine would probably be screaming.\n\nNow, the clutch is supposed to slip to also prevent shock loading. Your engine and transmission wouldn't be very happy if they were just **slammed** around with a bunch of harsh power, right? The clutch allows you to ease into power, making for a much more reliable transmission.\n\nWhat happens if you don't use your clutch?\n\nBig parts become many small parts."}]}

This coincided with the ability to wire photos between locations. That meant that the news of the theft including a photograph of what was stolen was much more widespread than at other times in history. People became much more familiar with the painting as a result of this timing. As we know, people like things they are familiar with and can relate to others on. The more people who see something, the more popular it becomes. The Mona Lisa became a cultural touchstone that transcended countries and cultures. I think that its an interesting painting, but the reasons people see it as \"great\" are subjective (as the variety of answers here demonstrates), but I think it became iconic due to timing of its theft and photographic technology spreading it over the world in a time when there was far less visual content than there is now. \n\nIn my opinion, it's important not to underestimate the extent to which our interests are being lead not by what we want, but by what is offered to us. Few people seek out alternatives to what is at hand and choose a favorite among limited and easily available options. This tends to apply to all things, including art."}]}

Others may emerge in the near or medium-term future, such as India or Brazil, but they're not quite there yet.\n\nOf the three, the European Union is likely to remain a stalwart ally in the near term, given our economic connections, cultural affinity, and generally seeing eye to eye on ideological and moral goals.  China often bumps heads with the U.S., particularly in regard to regional control of the South China Sea and the Southeast Asian commercial sphere, but our interconnected economies generally means the benefits of partnership outweigh antagonism.\n\nRussia is different.  Russia is not a major trading partner of the United States.  Russia also does not generally respect or believe in liberal democratic governance and individual rights, which the West considers preconditions for legitimate government.  Russia also has expansionary goals and wants to assert domination over former Soviet countries, in direct contravention of our European allies' desire to spread Western democracy eastward.\n\nAll this is to say that Russia is not a \"sudden\" threat.  They have remained a potential threat since the Cold War, only the threat was muted for about a decade or so after the fall of the Soviet Union, when their domestic political turmoil and lack of a modern market economy left them largely unable to project influence abroad.  Also, note that while the U.S. and Russia have agreed to mutually reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles, we have *far* more than either of us need to be an existential threat to the other, and maintaining current arms costs money that neither country really wanted to spend.\n\nIn the last half-decade or so, however, Russia has started to regain its footing, and Putin has felt emboldened to begin reassertion influence outside his borders.  Russia has become more brazen about murdering dissidents abroad, and invading its neighbors (with the 2008 invasion of Georgia, and the invasion of the Ukraine in 2014).  Putin's government has also been spending the years perfecting and adapting its soft-power abilities in the modern era, becoming masters at propaganda and cyberespionage. \n\nIt's this reassertion of power in the 2010s that has brought Russia back to the top of the threat board, with the turning point being their launching operations, beginning last year, to target the core functioning of the United States government.  This is not something powerful nations do to each other unless they are ready to enter a new phase of outright cold warfare.  The U.S. and Russia, of course, have never stopped keeping tabs on each other, but to directly attempt to influence the election, to target one of the country's two major parties -- and the party of the sitting president -- with open cyberespionage, is a little like sinking the *Lusitania*.\n\nThe U.S. public might not want to be the world police, but we are the leaders of the current global order, and as a whole this country generally benefits from having an open global market to purchase our goods and services. When you're on top of the world, the last thing you want is that world disrupted, so it's in our interest to maintain the status quo.  Russia wants to upend it."}]}

I worked the steps, was a sponsor of countless others but deep down struggled with a lot of the dogma... and there is dogma. Some lessons in AA were great, some lessons were harmful.  One major lesson is that your life is unmanageable and you need a higher power (which many call God) to solve your problems. When things were going great, people in AA use this as proof that the program works and a higher power has helped you solve what you couldn't solve yourself. When shit went wrong, the individual is blamed at times. The individual is labeled as not going to enough meetings or \"sitting on their laurels\". This can be true but not in every case, sometimes life goes wrong despite doing everything that is prescribed. This is life.

Though had I started drinking before addressing some of the Maslows hierarchy of needs or resolved reasons why I turned to drinking/ drugs to cope, I likely would have overdone it again.

Data is often at various places on the disk, and there needs to be time to swing the reading arm and head around to find the right place to read it from the disk. There is also the matter of when the data is read the disk is spinning by at great speed; the computer isn't always ready to accept the data from the disk, so it needs a buffer area (the cache) to put it in the meantime.\n\nThis means that drives exhibit \"burst\" speeds when reading and writing. If you wanted to save a file your computer could say \"save these memory addresses!\" and dump them directly from your computer's random-access memory into the drive's cache very quickly. Slightly later the drive actually gets around to positioning the heads and writing what is in the cache to the platters of the disk itself. However, if you have a lot of data to save it will eventually overwhelm the drive's cache and it will be forced to stop just storing it in the cache until it can work through the backlog.\n\nWhat this means is that when Windows looks at how quickly a file is being written by the drive it gets confusing results. The first few bits of the file are being accepted extremely quickly so it thinks it will finish the transfer very quickly, but after a little while the drive seems to slow down significantly. Now something it looked like would take 10 seconds is taking a minute. If you tell that drive to do other things too that minute could be come two, or even three!\n\nUltimately, the timer included in the box by Windows isn't going to be very smart. It only compares the clock to the rate of data transfer, which often doesn't consider the whole picture at all.\""}]}

Laughter is genetically meant to be some sort of a defense mechanism; we're programmed to think that when someone touches these sensitive spots on our body, that it will cause some sort of harm to us. Keep in mind, our body systems still function in a primitive manner: to ensure survival. When the touch signal is basically harmless, signals are sent back to the sensory cortex, to evoke laughter, which is practically a \"false alarm\" sign that nothing was wrong, to decrease any form of stress.

The first four books of the Bible -- Genesis through Numbers -- are themselves patchworks of older documents that we label J, E, and P. J is one of the oldest strands of the text and was probably first composed around 900 BCE; J may be the single oldest prose epic in human history (though that's debated). E was probably composed in the 800s BCE. P came later; either in the 720s BCE or possibly as late as the 550s. Please read up on the *Documentary Hypothesis.* \n\n2. Deuteronomy trough Kings was likely first written in the 620s BCE during the reign of King Josiah, drawing upon older court histories and records. It was revised in the 580s. Please read up on the *Deuteronomistic History.*  Throughout these books there are references to earlier works, all currently lost. Mostly court records and war stories. \n\n3. These books, but Genesis -- Deuteronomy especially, were redacted in the mid 400s. The \"Torah\" as we know it was firmly established by that time.\n\n4. The history found in Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah was written perhaps in the 400s, perhaps later.\n\n5. The various prophetic books are hard to date. Many hold a kernel of sayings that can be authentically attributed to the actual prophets working in Israel in the 900s through 500s; but there is also evidence of later interpolation and expansion of the core text.\n\n6. Similarly with the various poetic books. Psalms, for example, is an anthology that likely accreted over centuries. \n\nThe New Testament\n\n1. The four Gospels were likely written between 50 and 110 CE; most date them between 70 and 110. Mark was likely written first, then Matthew and Luke, then John. Luke drew on earlier oral histories; the rest do not cite their sources. \n\n2. The authentic letters of Paul were, of course, written in the 40s and 50s, when Paul was active.\n\n3. The remaining NT books were written between 70 and 100.\n\nLet me know if you want pointers to book-length references on this topic.\n\nRecall that the Bible isn't a book: it's a library. It contains books of history, of poetry, of prophecy; letters, biographies, and more prophecies. Each book or set of books should be taken into consideration individually when thinking about their date of composition, and one should have an eye towards the historical context as well."}]}

{"id": "2hzvm1", "input": "If our body is constantly producing new cells to replace old ones, why do we age?", "output": [{"answer": "There's quite a substantial difference in types of rubber and glue. It affects things like how fast the ball bounces off the paddle, how much spin can be put on the ball. If the ball is already spinning significantly, the softer, stickier rubber will also be more impacted by that spin, meaning that if the ball comes at the paddle with top spin, it's going to go up, and with underspin, down.\n\nTable tennis is very much a game of spin. Spin causes the ball to curve through the air, bounce off the table differently, and bounce off the racket differently. Because of how significant spin is to the game, competitive players often disguise the type of spin they're putting on the ball. This includes things like hitting the ball below the table, stomping on the ground when they hit the ball, or changing the direction of their stroke at the last minute. If you can make the other player think the ball is spinning differently than it is, they're much more likely to make a mistake.\n\nAs an example, I have a racket that has dead rubber on one side and fast rubber with high spin on the other side.\n\nThe black side is unaffected by existing spin, and just returns it as is. If my opponent puts heavy spin on the ball, it bounces straight off my paddle and is returned with that same spin. The black side also slows down the return and drops the ball much closer to the net.\n\nThe red side is fast and imparts heavy spin.\n\nI can make motions with the black side that look like they would induce spin, and it returns a dead ball. If my opponent watches my motion and assumes spin, they're likely to overcompensate and hit the ball off the table. I can then \"twiddle\" (flip the paddle) and impart heavy, fast spin.\n\nIf the opponent can't visually tell between the two sides of a paddle, this would give some players an unfair advantage. Because of this, different colors of rubber are mandated by competitive table tennis rules."}]}

However, South Africa is a massively complex and nuanced place and nothing there can be understood in simplistic black and white terms (bad pun intended). For instance, although the whites created apartheid, Mandela's defence lawyers were all white people and there were many very active and vocal white members of the ANC (Mandela's political party). The black South Africans were for the most part rural, illiterate people who spent most of their time working hard to survive and so they didn't have the revolutionary drive seen in others countries.\n\nAlso, the whites from before official apartheid times used tactics to control the black population, such as emphasising the language and tribal barriers within the black population. The apartheid government set up 'homelands' for each black tribe which were in actual fact the worst most uninhabitable parts of the region and then told them they could only live in those areas. These areas were not officially part of South Africa but were supposedly independent.  Black people had to have special pass books (like passports) to work in the areas under white control which is where all the jobs were.

At typical road speeds though this isn't an issue, there's still more than enough grip to drive safely.\n\nThe reason tyres on the road are required to have tread is to displace water when it rains and avoid aquaplaning at high speeds.\n\nNote, you have less grip in the wet (separate from aquaplaning) but the tread won't help here, you'd still be better with slicks.\n\nAs an aside, you'll note that many cyclists use slick tyres on the road in the wet and dry. This is because it gives better grip and there's no chance of aquaplaning on a bike (you'd have to be going something like 9.sqrt(psi) to aquaplane on a bike, which for, say a tyre inflated to 100 psi would be around 90mph. Way above the top speed of cyclists) However if you watch a bike race when it's wet you'll see a few of them sliding off their bikes if they corner too fast in the wet because of the reduced grip.\n\nAs for shoes it depends on the surface. If you have a soft surface like mud or snow, then you want treaded tyres and shoes. This is why MTB tyres and walking boots have those big knobbly treads. These treads dig into the soft surface and give you grip.\n\nOn pavements though, the reverse is the case, the tyre rubber is soft and the rough surface that it digs into is the tarmac on the road."}]}

John Maynard Keynes was an economist who theorized that if the government creates artificial surpluses and debts, we can steer the economy towards the ideal growth, instead of having fluctuations. In theory, a surplus would benefit regular people because in the next time of \"famine\" the government would release the money back into the market in the form of work programs and federal aid or stimulus packages.

Although the company doesn't call it DRM, for the end-user it's essentially DRM. Why the distinction? Because what Denuvo does is not authenticate the software, but rather protect the software from being modified, which is what you need to crack the actual DRM inside of it. It's basically DRM for the DRM.\n\n**Why people don't like it**  \nBecause of it's \"phone home\" reuqirements. Denuvo has to call the servers every few days to authenticate, meaning those with bad internet can be cut off from their games. Furthermore, if Denuvo ever goes down or the company ceases to exist, those games become unplayable unless developers patch it out (which most are unlikely to do). \n\nAlso, since it's an anti-modification technology, it prevents people from modding games outside of changing the bits that the developer allows. This is relevant for some games more than others, but still somewhat relevant. \n\n**Why it's a big deal**  \nBecause Denuvo works. As bad as the internet requirements are, Denuvo is actually a rather unintrussive software unlike previous infamous DRMs like Starforce or SecuRom. Combine that with the fact that it does it's job (to stop pirates, albeit for only a while) and you can see why more and more developers are starting to use it. Developers don't really care that much if a game gets cracked in three months, they mostly care about the first month of sales because that's where they get the bulk of the money. So stopping piracy in that timeframe makes Denuvo \"good enough\"."}]}

Using the computer metaphor again, this would be like one computer having a SSD that can access each byte of information almost simultaneously, over a HDD that needs to slowly trudge its way through to find the location of the bytes. \n\n(I'm in no way a neurologist, so if someone would like to correct me please by all means do)."}]}
{"id": "51k0g0", "input": "Why do heating pads (or any other warm thing) help with period cramps, stomach pain, etc?", "output": [{"answer": "People want to fly directly to their destinations. In the past airlines focused on a \"hub and spoke\" system where small planes flew between small destinations and major hubs and huge planes could fly between the hubs. The development of long-range, fuel-efficient medium-sized planes enabled more \"point-to-point\" flights where people can skip the connection in a hub (or at the very least reduce two connections to one). These new planes also allow infrequent flights between distant hubs to be replaced by more frequent (meaning more convenient for passengers) flights. It used to be that if you wanted to fly *really* far you *needed* a 747 or A380, just because those were the only planes that could fly the distance, even if it wasn't the ideal size otherwise. Now you can, for example, replace the 747 on that route with a 787 and just fly more frequently."}]}

The Royal Navy sailors(most sailors actually) would put their elbows on the table while eating to secure their plate from sliding around during rough seas.  When the sailors would land at a port of call they still ate with their elbows planted on the table.  This allowed the locals to recognize the sailors from other patrons.  Given that sailors in the 1700-1800's generally didn't have the best manners,  the towns people didn't want their children or themselves to be mistaken as one of the dirty boat people so discouraged it and cha ching a tradition was born.

The resulting image is basically a \"smear\" of the light that came through the aperture.\n\nThe larger the aperture, the smaller the smear.\n\nThe tl;dr of this is that a telescope has an angular resolution, and anything smaller than that resolution will be mixed together with what's around it, and not be visible.\n\nYour eyes are apertures as well, and this is why objects that are a certain distance away get fuzzy, and then farther away become indistinguishable from the background.\n\nNow if this wasn't bad enough, ground-based telescopes also have to contend with the atmosphere. Light diffracts as it passes through regions with different density, heat, and water content. If the atmosphere was static, this would just cause some image distortions, but since it's not and theae atmospheric pockets move around, it changes where that light diffracts to. This in turn causes more \"smearing\".\n\nSo ground based telescopes have a theoretical angular resolution based on the size of the telescope, but never reach that resolution thanks to the atmospheric effects.\n\nEdit (I did the math): The angular resolution is 1.22 x wavelength / diameter of the telescope. Picking 600nm for the light (greenish yellow) and a 30cm diameter (a fairly powerful consumer telescope) gives you 2.44x10^-6 radians. So the minimum size then is 2.44x10^-6 x distance to the object.\n\nThe moon is 384 400 km away, so the minimum size of an object that will be distinguishable would be about 938 meters in size.

It could be -20 outside, or 45c, and the battery needs to operate, not catch on fire, and not have it's life severely shortened from environmental factors.\n\nLead acid batteries are very old technology, but the reason it's still used for things like UPS power supplies, deep cycle batteries for boats, and automobile power, is because they operate under a wide range of conditions, reliably, and safely. They can take the heat and the cold, and still produce large amounts of cranking power (amps). \n\nThey are also able to discharge and recharge repeatedly without damaging the cells. NIMH batteries lose their charge over time, and lose capacity quickly with frequent discharge/recharge cycles. Lithium Ion batteries are very delicate, prone to high and low temperature failure, and they can explode. They also have a limited number of charge/discharge cycles before losing capacity. \n\nBut you say, electric cars use them! This is true, and they make up a considerable portion of the total cost of the vehicle. They don't last very long, a half dozen years or so. And they must use a significant portion of their power in order to keep the batteries at a safe operating temperature.

{"id": "4gesa0", "input": "Why are there separate prices for different age groups?", "output": [{"answer": "Your question sort of requires two answers, as hard drives and flash drives operate in different ways when it comes to data persistence (memory sticks work the same as flash drives).\n\nIn a traditional rotational hard drive, the data is actually physically present on the device. It's written as a binary series of 1s and 0s on a metal plate which is coated in a small layer of magnetic material. There is a head on a small arm which moves around the disk while it spins and changes the polarity of small sections of this layer in order to represent a value (this is why running a strong magnet over a hard drive will destroy it). \n\nFlash memory works in an entirely different way. It uses many small transistors which can hold a charge to represent either a 1 or 0. NAND flash, which is the kind usually used in memory sticks and SSDs is created out of a series of transistors which form something called a NAND (not-and) gate which is read as a binary 1 when there's no charge being stored in it and a 0 otherwise. So to write, you simply store a charge in the bits that you want to be 0, and to write them back to one you remove the charge. This works without power, but not indefinitely. Flash memory will eventually lose it's charge and \"forget\" values after a certain amount of time without power (like 10+ years, in most cases). It's also worth noting that because of the way flash memory works, you have a limited number of erase/write cycles available before it breaks down (this varies by the type of memory as well as lots of other factors I won't get into). \n\nI'm sure some EE will come in here with a much more thorough explanation, but that's the gist of it."}]}

This means it's relatively dry most of the year. Many of the historic residents, pre colonial demarcation, moved cattle across the region based on seasonal changes, they were migratory. However when the borders were drawn on the map, many people were locked into a specific location wherever they happened to be at that time. \n\nTheir access to water or grazing lands, which they have been using for hundreds if not thousands of years, disappeared practically overnight. They became stuck in a desert while their economy was built around cattle.

Now, say you have a few million dollars and need more for a charity for holocaust survivors, you invest in a guy like Madoff because he was well known as a finance genius and also Jewish so the idea that he would defraud a holocaust survivors fund is not only crazy to think about, it would be betrayal of his own people. So he would tell them to invest their money but at the end of the day he put it all into a personal account and would take mondy out to pay back certain clients and keep them happy/give off the idea that their money is doing well and safe.\n\nThe main thing of why it was a huge deal is two things, one of them is the dollar amount that he had and defrauded from clients. He also was a decently well known man in the finance and business world so think of someone like Trump being found out to have been stealing clients money while being on the covers of magazines, you just really don't expect someone who is constantly in the spotlight and being called a magician of money to be frauding almost everyone along the ride. \n\nI have a very basic/movie based run down of it cause it's a very complicated case but that's the basic gist of it"}]}

{"id": "3746j7", "input": "those bidding sites where people pay pennies for stuff", "output": [{"answer": "This is actually a trick question, as according to most modern historians, the Roman Empire *didn't* 'collapse.' The traditional date given for said event is 476 C.E., when the 'last' \"real\" Roman Emperor was deposed by his Master of Horse, the 'barbarian' Odoacer. Notice the large number of quotations I had to use in that sentence. The truth is that this date is really rather arbitrary, as are many of the widely-memorized dates in popular history. Basically, you have an Emperor, Romulus Augustulus (a pejorative term meaning 'the little Augustus'), ostensibly being forced out of his place at the head of the government of Rome by his second-in-command, Odoacer, a man of German descent. The truth was that Odoacer had really been in control all along. You see, the Master of Horse was a position that at the end of the Empire--the last century, or so--was used by strong-men to seize power without actually holding the dangerous office of emperor. In fact, the last dozen or so emperors are now commonly referred to as the 'puppet emperors' for just this reason: Odoacer and his predecessors did the heavy lifting behind the scenes while some patsy stood in the spotlight. Clearly Odoacer just tired of the charade in 476 when he deposed Augustulus and took sole power, and my guess is that it was just easier to have done with it.\n\nNow, since Odoacer had really been in power all along, you may wonder why 476 is such an important date in Roman history. Well, the truth is that it wasn't. If you were a Roman at the time, you probably wouldn't have cared all that much, except for if you were directly affected--i.e., you were a vehement and vocal supporter of Augustulus. So why do history books emphasize this date so much if it doesn't matter? That's because it's convenient. Most people learn this date in high school from a book that has thousands of others like it. It's dumbed-down, simplistic history made for teenagers who don't really care all that much. As for the true story, as always in history the answer is extremely complex. There are multiple, sometimes-conflicting theories about the 'fall' of the Empire, but most of them agree on one thing: the Roman Empire lasted for centuries after the traditional 476 fall, and instead of ceasing to exist it **transitioned** into a different stage. In this way it was like the transition from Monarchy to Republic, or Republic to Empire, except the process was perhaps more subtle.\n\nOne theory emphasizes that the Roman Empire that 'collapsed' with Augustulus was really only *half* of the Roman Empire. Hundreds of years earlier, the Empire had been divided into two administrative sections (and then four, and then back to two), the East and the West. The part which 'fell' was the West, with its official capital at Trier, not Rome. The East, with its capital at Constantinople--formerly called Byzantium--was hardly affected by the 'crisis' in the West, probably because it was so filthy rich that it could (and did) pay off all its violent neighbors. This half of the Empire is in modern times called the \"Byzantine\" Empire for a number of reasons, but partly because it makes the whole \"when did Rome fall\" issue simpler. In fact, though, the \"Byzantines\" continued in every way to be the Eastern Roman Empire for another thousand years until the Ottoman Turks finally conquered them in 1453. They even considered themselves Romans, and their leader was considered to be the Roman Emperor. So this is one strong theory about the 'fall' of the Roman Empire.\n\nAnother theory is that the Roman Empire lived on 'under new management' under the guiding hand of Odoacer and his peers and successors. The truth of the matter is that very little of the existing structure of governance was actually changed; the Germans who did take new roles knew the system worked, and actually stood in awe of it. They didn't want to *destroy* Rome, they wanted to *be* Romans. It was such a good system, why not? So there is a mountain of evidence for this theory, too.\n\nAnother theory is that the Roman Empire lived on in the Catholic Church. It's a bit less well-founded, but the Church and the Empire were inexorably tied together after Constantine and perhaps a little before that. In fact, the Church's organizational system is 100% based on Roman organization: 'diocese' is an Anglicization of a Latin word that meant something very similar.\n\nThere are others, too. Some historians believe that the Arabs were the successors to the Romans, as they really absorbed Roman learning within a very short time and expanded upon it. I don't know if this makes sense within the context of \"the Empire didn't actually fall,\" though.\n\nSo, now you know that the Empire didn't actually 'fall.' To answer you original question, which could be better phrased as \"Why was the Western Roman Empire forced to transition in the 5th century?,\" the truth is again, complicated. But I'll cover the broad strokes.\n\nA huge contributing factor was the one you probably already know: the 'barbarians.' However, the Germanic peoples who are nearly always depicted as the enemies of everything Roman were definitely not actually that. In fact, they were very envious of Roman prosperity, and many times their incursions into Roman territory were the result of Roman racism interfering with good foreign policy. For instance, one of the largest Visigoth 'invasions' was due to the bungling of a certain Roman aristocrat who was overseeing a huge settlement of Visigoths in unused Roman territory, but allowed conditions to get so bad that there was nothing for the Germans to do but attack. More than envy, though, what was pushing the Germanic tribes into Roman territory was fear: the Huns were coming. The terrible Huns of legend were a force to be reckoned with: according to stories from the time the Huns were expert horsemen--supposedly, men, women, and children would stay on horseback all day, not even dismounting to eat and sleep. As these crazed military geniuses ravaged northeastern Europe, the Germanic tribes on the borders of Rome slowly became more and more exposed until they had to encroach on Roman borders. Faced with certain death from the Huns, they preferred the promise of relative safety in Roman borders.\n\nIt was not unusual for Romans to allow the various tribes to settle in unused Roman land. Unfortunately, as I have said, they usually treated them as second class citizens, and many costly revolts resulted. Because these began within Roman borders, the Empire was particularly exposed to danger, and there was a great deal of devastation in the West--including the sack of Rome itself in 410. The East largely escaped unscathed using the incredibly-effective method of paying exorbitant amounts of money to their would-be attackers to keep themselves safe. You see, the West could not afford such luxuries, as the East contained the richest provinces--most notably the 'bread-basket' of the old Empire, Egypt--where the West was mostly a group of blood-suckers by comparison. So the West had to take its beatings. This was a major contributing factor to the transformation of the West from 'late Roman Empire' to 'post-Roman era.'\n\nA second contributing factor is the devaluing of the Roman currency. To be a popular--not to mention breathing--emperor, one had to keep the Army happy, above all else. To reward the army on a job well done, one emperor decided it would be nice to raise their pay. As such, he increased each soldier's pay from something like 200 denarii a month to 350 denarii a month. What a deal for the army, right? Well yes, but there was a catch. The Roman government, by law, operated on a balanced budget. Because there was no extra billion denarii sitting around in the budget, this change was basically untenable except for one ingenious and disastrous innovation: melting down the denarii and adding a very amount of a common metal to increase the number of coins without adding more silver. That way, the army got paid more but no more money was actually needed than what they already had. The soldiers get more money, the emperor gets their loyalty, and the budget is balanced--everybody wins, right? Well, except that the Romans didn't understand modern economics very well. As the coins were melted down, again and again over decades, there was less and less silver per coin. This effect was exacerbated by subsequent emperor's own increases to the army's pay. As such, within a century or so the denarius was valued so little that people just refused to use it. The problem was that this USED to be how everyone was paid by the government and it was fine, but now they got paid the same or a little more and it was worthless. Slowly but surely, the *entire system* broke down, and the denarius was basically scrap metal. People used gold coins when they could--these had not been devalued--but they were worth so much that they generally couldn't be used for everyday purchases. This was a problem that plagued the Empire for decades, and eventually forced the entire Empire to turn back the clock and start trading **in kind**--using livestock, grains, etc. as currency. It was mayhem. This weakened the Empire considerably, especially in regard to its ability to pay its all-important army--not to mention the terrified tribes on its borders.\n\nThose are easily the two most important factors in the 'collapse' of the Empire. There are at least a dozen more, but they require a bit of background knowledge and it took me a half hour to write all of this, so I hope this will suffice."}]}

{"id": "4mfp46", "input": "Why does absolutely nobody live in Vermont if nearly all other northeastern states like New York and Connecticut are so densely populated?", "output": [{"answer": "Horsepower is a unit of power.  Torque is a unit of force.  Power is something you get from doing work, over an amount of time.  Instead of throwing crazy units at you, I'll use the ones we're used to seeing in car magazines.  \n\nThat is Torque is how hard something is being twisted.  You can twist something very hard, without it moving.  (this is important)  If something isn't moving, NO WORK is being done. \n\n\"Per minute\" is our usual unit of time, when it comes to engines.  \n\nRevolutions, is the distance that our work is being done over.  For the sake of doing the math, \"revolutions a shaft turns\" is just as good as \"how far the car goes\".  \n\nBecause torque gets multiplied by RPM, below 5252 rpm, horsepower is always less than torque below 5252 rpm, and horsepower is always more than torque over 5252rpm.\n\nNow things get more interesting.  \n\n**Discussing Horsepower Vs. Torque**\n\nFor a given total gear ratio, total weight, and tire size, an engine with more torque, will accelerate faster.  This is because the engine is turning the same rpm (as prescribed by the tire size and gear ratio) and will be making more horsepower.  \n\nWhen people say \"torque is what you feel\" this is what they mean.  The statement is wrong, for most comparisons though.  \n\nUsually, a car's transmission, is designed for the sort of power that the engine makes. As long as tire slippage isn't an issue, we can figure out how fast a car will accelerate by knowing how much torque is applied to the wheels.   Lets say we have a Lawnmower engine, and a Motorcycle engine.  Both make 20hp.  Both in a gokart, with a chain and sprocket that makes changing gears easy.  \n\nThe lawnmower makes it's maximum horsepower at 3600rpm.  At 3600rpm, it's making 20hp, and 29lbft of torque.  \n\nThe motorcycle makes it's maximum horsepower at 9000rpm.  (not over.. but right at 9000..)  At 9000rpm, to make 20hp, it is working it's guts out, and giving us 11.7lbft of torque.\n\nWe'll do our test from 20mph.  The gokart has 9\" diameter wheels, which means those tires are spinning at 747rpm.   To get the fastest acceleration, we need to do the most work.  The most work the engine can make is at it's horsepower peak.  So we'll need to gear those engines so they're turning the right RPM at 20mph.  \n\nThe lawnmower kart, would need a 4.82:1 gear reduction to be turning 3600rpm at 20mph.  That means those wheels are seeing 139.8lbft of torque.  That's quite a bit!  Now lets try the motorcycle.  To be turning 9000rpm at 20mph needs a 12:1 gear ratio.  That works out to ... uh... 140lbft.  That's something like 0.2%.  That's all rounding errors and not caring to carry out things to 14 decimal places.  Both karts are putting out the same torque to the wheels, because they're making the same horsepower, at the same wheel rpm.  They will accelerate the same.  (or close enough to the same, other funny things start to count at really high rpms.. and when you start having multiple stages of gearing, but that's not the point we're going for here.)\n\nThe thing to take away from this, is \"Horsepower is power.  Power is acceleration.\"\n\n**Why do some engines make more torque, why do others make more horsepower**\n\nThe factors involved in producing horsepower (and torque) are many, varied, and a much longer story than we can cover in depth here.  But... I can throw some important things at you.  \n\nEngines are air pumps.  The more air you move through and engine, the more fuel you can burn, and the more torque you can make.  (ooh, there's that word again.)  The more air and fuel you burn in the cylinder, the more torque you can make per power stroke.  \n\nEngines have a hard time getting air into themselves though.  Valves are small, cylinder heads have lots of turns and twists, and there are gasses still hanging around in the cylinder blocking the flow of incoming air.. it's a mess.  This gets expressed in a number called volumetric efficiency.  (VE from here on out)  That number represents how much actual air you get into the cylinder per intake stroke, versus the swept are of the cylinder.  (read: displacement.)  Typical engines are in the 70-90% range.  \n\nVolumetric efficancy varies with rpm.  You can see a graph of an engines VE by looking at the torque curve on a dyno graph.  That torque curve, once you factor out rotating friction, and things like driving the oil pump, directly traces the VE of an engine.  \n\nThe easy way to make more torque, is to have more displacement.  Assuming you don't adversely affect the VE of the engine, more displacement is always going to get you more torque.  Remember that horsepower is torque times rpm.  If you can make X foot pounds of torque, making it at a higher rpm means you make more power.  If your goal is to go faster, or haul things up a steeper hill, you want more power.  \n\nAir is springy.  It accelerates slowly, it stops slowly, it likes to rattle around.  This shake, and spring, is why changing the length of a trombone slide changes the note.  That shake, or resonant frequency, can be taken advantage of in an engine.  By tuning the intake length, and exhaust lengths, and shapes, you can boost the VE of an engine.  The faster an engine turns, the stronger these effects are.  VE's over 120% aren't exotic in high rpm engines, most of those gains come from taking advantage of air's inertia, and springiness.  \n\nThis all sounds like you should never make a low RPM motor, doesn't it?  Well there are some downsides to having a high rpm engine.  Higher rpm engines spend more energy pumping air, pumping oil, and trying to slide surfaces against each other.  So they burn more energy \"running the engine.\"  They also fail harder.  The slower the engine is, the lower tech you can get away with and still make a decent engine.  That means you can spend less money on the technology, and spend more money on making it bigger, or save money by making it cheaper.  Slow engines also give the fuel more time to burn, so you can get some efficiency gains there as well.\n\nAnother factor, is some engines are compression ignition, and use diesel.  Diesel engines have their own set of challenges.  But what you need to know, is that they're mostly limited to about 5000 rpm by the physics of trying to run a flamethrower inside a cylinder.  You end up with big displacement diesels, because you can't make them little and fast.  Diesel engines are not rpm limited by cylinder geometry!  \n\nHopefully this helps."}]}

As such, I based my opinion of myself entirely on what other people thought of me. Specifically, I based it on which girls wanted to date me. If a girl didn't like me, I subconsciously attributed it to them being better than me and thus more socially valuable and validating. \n\nParadoxically, though, as soon as they showed interest in me, I would lose interest in them because that meant they were in fact no better than me socially/physically or perhaps even slightly worse. This was due entirely to my low opinion of myself since it meant they had been exposed as not being as valuable as I had initially thought they were. In other words, it would immediately knock them down to my level instead of raising me up to theirs. I would repeat the process by seeking out the next highest plausibly attainable girl I could. I hurt a lot of girls this way and I'm very deeply embarrassed by how badly I treated them. \n\nIt's one of my biggest regrets in life but I'm more at peace with it today knowing what I know now. I call it the \"pedestal paradox\" since I would put girls on a pedestal when they didn't want me and they would get knocked down when they started to like me. I've since overcome it to find a happy and stable relationship/marriage (13 years and running).\n\nThere's another aspect to this that's important to mention. When I was young my mother had a serious drinking problem starting around the time I entered junior high school and she basically checked herself out of my life. Having lost that very fundamental and important foundation may be the root cause of why I sought out superficial attention and validation from other women. Being broken up with was worse than death for me because I had nothing to fall back on. I had no mother there to tell me everything was going to be ok and comfort me. In essence, being broken up with was like losing my mother every time it happened. It was brutal.\n\nAnd other people I've observed this condition in often have had issues with their opposite sex parent. I would not be surprised if the OP does herself. The best advice I can give is to set dating aside until you truly discover what makes you valuable to the world. If you're getting that validation of your self worth from other people you will suffer through an endless cycle of loss and anguish as I did. It wasn't until I was brought to my knees by life and had nobody else to turn to that I slowly started to build up confidence that wasn't rooted in other people's perception or acceptance of me.

Because most African tribes were nomads?", "output": [{"answer": "There are several good answers here. I would add this gross simplification:\n\nOur capacity to recognize words lives in one (well, two, possibly more) part of our brains. Our ability to maintain concentration resides in a different place(s) in our brains. Our ability to encode things into memory resides in a different part of our brains. \n\nIf you can read, your brain will probably automatically sort the letters into words. But if you don't also engage concentration while you read, it will never be encoded into memory. Even if you do both of those things, if you don't have either 1) a previous cognitive framework for sorting the information or 2) some emotional valence (ie., it's too boring to care about) your brain won't be able to functionally sort it into your memory. So there are a lot of points of failure where if your brain isn't coordinating with itself, you can spend hours reading and hardly remember a thing."}]}

The radio wave hits the surface of an object and is reflected back at the radar station.  It measures the time it takes for the radio wave it sent to get back and that tell you how far away and in what direction an object is.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nMost airplanes are made of rounded shapes.  So not matter what direction the airplane is facing there is always a part of the plane that can reflect the radar signal back towards the radar station.  The stealth airplanes are made up of flat surfaces.  When radar hits the flat surfaces the radio waves are not reflected back to the radar station but they are reflected away instead.  They also use materials on the surfaces that help absorb the radio waves instead of reflecting them.  Stealth airplanes are not 100% invisible there are certain angles that the radar can hit the aircraft and reflect straight back to the radar station so that it can detect it.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nIf you have a reflective ball like a Christmas ornament you can see the process illustrated with light waves instead of radio waves.  Because the Christmas ornament is rounded you can see your reflection in the ball no matter what angle the ball is from you.  But if you take a flat mirror you can only see your reflection if you are facing the mirror at a very narrow angle."}]}

{"id": "2xk4nb", "input": "What's the purpose of a blindfold during an execution?", "output": [{"answer": "How it works is dependent on which type you're referring to. Local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine and novocaine, block nerve cell transmission to pain centers in the central nervous system by binding to (and inhibiting the function of) an ion channel in the cell membrane of nerve cells. This action works on the nerve impulses near the site of the injection or application, but there are no changes in sense perception in other areas, hence the name \"local anesthetic\". \n\nGeneral anesthesia is much different from local. There are two major types: twilight and full. General anesthetics induce a state of general insensibility to pain. The patient loses awareness of pain and surroundings, yet vital physiologic functions, such as breathing and maintenance of blood pressure continue to function. Despite being around for more than a century and a half, less is known about the mechanics of general anesthesia than local. Most general are volatile (meaning they're inhaled; think gas at the dentist), and these are structurally related to ether, which was the original anesthetic. Their primary site of action is in the central nervous system, where they inhibit nerve transmission by a mechanism distinctly different from that of local anesthetics. They cause a reduction in nerve transmission at the synapses, which are the sites at which neurotransmitters are released and begin their initial actions in the body. Volatile anesthetics are more soluble in lipids, and thus primarily affect the function of the ion channel and neurotransmitter proteins in the membranes of the nerve cells, which are lipid environments. \n\nTwilight anesthestics, also known as conscious sedation, is used for shorter, less serious procedures. You're actually awake, at least for the most part, but you're sleepy and relaxed and a sort of hypnotic state. You may feel giddy or euphoric, and you won't remember (typically) the procedure or the immediate period of time following. The drugs used for this type of sedation may be volatile, or injected, or oral...or a combination. Because the drugs are structually similar to the compounds used in general anesthesia, the manner in which is they work is also similar, though they're also often combined with an anelgesic, such as fentanyl, for pain relief."}]}

We don't care what it looks like at this point because it's not our input or result. A second operation happens on what's in the hidden node and the result gets stored into the output node where we read it. This node we care about, so we don't hide what's in it.\n\nWe train the network by giving it a bunch of inputs, the network tried different combinations of operations along the way, then we judge whether the output is correct and ask the network to do it over again until it's getting mostly correct outputs. We only care what inputs we put in and whether the output is right. Since the machine determines the operations itself and we don't need to know what the operations are, the don't look at the middle steps too close, hence, \"hidden\". Of course a real neural network will have a bunch of hidden nodes in layers all tied together.\n\nIf you look at the middle nodes, a lot of the time there will be no obvious rhyme or reason to why the computer is doing what it's doing, but it still gets the right answer.

The Federal government mostly relies on income taxes, states use a mix of income and sales tax, local governments use a mix of sales tax and property tax.\n\nTaxes on assets like homes and cars are charged annually because the infrastructure needed to make those assets usable and enjoyable requires ongoing funding. A house won't be worth living in if the schools suck, there are no parks, no police or fire protection, etc. A car requires there to be roads, and snow removal, etc. To charge you upfront for the lifespan of the house or car for these would be more than anybody could pay, and the services are needed on an ongoing basis, so there are annual taxes. As for vehicle taxes, some states charge an annual tax based on value, while others have more substantial gasoline taxes to fund this. Property taxes are typically based on the value of a property, both because those who can afford a larger home can afford more taxes and because they are to some extent benefiting more from the services (ie. those with a 4BR home will likely have more kids attending the local schools than the single person in the 1BR condo).\n\nInheritances are taxed on a one time basis, and the reality is that any inheritance large enough to fall into the transfer tax range means that the person who acquired the fortune was asleep at the wheel in terms of estate planning -- there are ways to minimize or avoid inheritance taxes via trusts, etc."}]}

Remember - insurance is a bet. One you hope to never win. So you insure against things that you can't control but would have terrible consequence if they happen: Your house catching fire, a car accident, death, medical problems. \n\nThe insurance company tries to figure out the probability of that thing happening amongst a group of people, and charges enough that they can pay the claims and still make money (otherwise they won't be in that business) and the price is low enough for each individual because the chance of it happening to any one person is an acceptable risk to them.\n\nHowever most dental work is under your control. You can usually wait to have work done. So people are more likely to game the system by buying insurance for a short time, having a lot of work done, then dropping the insurance. This is obviously not an acceptable risk for the insurance company. So what happens is either the policies that an individual can buy are wimpy - they don't cover much and aren't a good deal for what they do cover. OR the policies are bought by companies that employ a lot of people as a perk. Since the individuals aren't paying they are less likely to game the system.\n\nRemember I said most and usually.
