{"id": "1kiwfx", "input": "In Trading Places (1983, Akroyd/Murphy) how does the scheme at the end of the movie work? Why would buying a lot of OJ at a high price ruin the Duke Brothers?", "output": [{"answer": "The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit."}]}
{"id": "52py6m", "input": "What causes the trail behind jets at high altitude?", "output": [{"answer": "Jets passing over typically are flying at altitudes where temperatures are fairly low - -40C. At this temperature, in clear air, there isn't a lot of water vapor (humidity) in the air. A jet engine takes this air in and uses it to burn fuel, which it pushes out of its exhaust. The fuel burns to mostly carbon dioxide and water. The air exiting the engine now has considerable water vapor in it. The exiting air mixes with the surrounding air, dropping its temperature rapidly. When hot, this air could hold a lot of water vapor. After cooling, it can't. The water vapor, which is clear, has to go somewhere, and where it goes is into ice or water droplets. These are no longer invisible, but reflect light, and appear white. There's a little more than that, in that the jet engine doesn't really burn the fuel perfectly, so some stuff is left over other than carbon dioxide and water - partly burned fuel. This makes particles that are needed to start the water vapor on its way to becoming liquid water or ice. These particles are called seeds."}]}

Then the Belgians came and colonized the region and they saw the hierarchical system as a way to effectively control the people. In doing so they added a racial dynamic in which those with lighter skin,narrow noses and tall height were considered Tutsi while those who had more negroid features were considered Hutu or twa. The Tutsis who ran Rwanda weren't very nice to the Hutus and this sowed the hatred and resentment for the Tutsis amongst Hutus. This changed with the wave of African independence movements which made the Tutsis demand independence(because being upper class they were more educated and were more exposed to pan Africanist ideas spreading at the time).This resulted in Belgium switching its support to the Hutus because with Tutsi leaders pushing for independence there was a fear that Rwanda would become communist and Hutus were seen as easier to control. Eventually the Hutus would overthrow the Tutsi monarchy in Rwanda which was then followed by a purge of Tutsi leading many into exile and installing a hardline regime that ruled until it was overthrown in 1994, by The Rwandan patriotic front led by Tutsi exiles based and supported by Uganda."}]}

What actually (currently) happens is that your first $x of income is taxed at the first bracket's percentage, the next $y of income at the next percentage, and so on. For example, if the next bracket is 20% at $86,000 and your AGI was $86,091, only $91 would be taxed at 20%, and the remaining $86,000 is separated into lower rates (e.g. 10% of your first $30,000, plus 15% of $56,000). If you were to graph taxes paid against AGI, it would have a slight curve. Against gross income, there would be a \"landing area\" corresponding to the standard exemption. Graphing percentage paid as tax against income might actually look somewhat like a parabola, depending on the number of brackets and the rates in between.

Half the users look at the app at least 1 time every day and 1 quarter of the users make use of the app more than 5 times every day. So, an advertiser can pay Instagram for access to those users. Maybe they only pay for female users in France that use the app at least twice a day, or maybe they only pay for Male users in Australia that follow certain types of accounts (surf companies for example). This gives the company value because their user base is easily accessible by advertising companies. The data that we generate (views, likes, personal data like age, gender etc..) also provides value. In this example Instagram can show what different groups of people are into and what sort of trends are happening. At the moment I don't think Tinder has any paid content. Snapchat has the discover page, but we don't pay to access that. For companies like this, every single user is worth money to them and other companies are willing to pay to have data on what we do."}]}

Your vocal cords would be more elastic and flexible, and this would make your voice able to produce more overtones, or the right mix of overtones which sound pleasant. Overtones are basically sound waves on top of sound waves which have wavelengths that overlap on the original wave, e.g. half the wavelength, one third the wavelength, and we can tell the difference between a trumpet and a piano or a sweet and a shrill voice largely by picking up on the differences between the mixtures of overtones. Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing.

{"id": "21t83f", "input": "as someone from the UK, I have no idea why obamacare has been getting so much hate. explain.", "output": [{"answer": "First you have to look at what it claims to do, then what problems we have, and then if what it does addresses the problems we have. *What it claims to do*: Make healthcare more accessible and more affordable. For the Accessible part, there were only about 12 million people that are \"Chronically\" uninsured in America. The total \"number of uninsured\" was inflated grossly. And the \"Affordable\" part doesn't hold muster period. There was a lot of hand-waving, saying that uninsured people were costing a ton for Emergency Rooms, and if you got them regular care it would actually be cheaper. In reality what they're really doing is trying to socialize and subsidize insurance payments. If you extend free or subsidized coverage to an extra 30 million people, it's going to cost more, period. Which isn't automatically bad. It's just they weren't honest about it. *What we had* pre-Obamacare The main (valid) complaint is that it is too expensive. And it *was* pretty expensive. The flip side of that expense is that we have very short waiting periods, and our doctor and care networks were very extensive. If my liver started blowing up, I'd get shipped over to Seattle *that night*, and get treated at University of Washington's premiere Medical facility with top doctors. I'd get as good of care as any CEO or any President. This is in contrast to the single-payer systems in Britain and formerly in Canada, where lower costs also mean less supply, so time-sensitive procedures were delayed by days, months, or even years. I say 'former' in Canada because their system was declared a human rights violation about a decade ago, the waits were so bad. So they had to allow private clinics to re-open. Which means, even in 'socialized medicine' you get two classes of treatment. Those for the poor and those for the rich. In America, the disparity of care between classes (amongst the insured) is significantly smaller. But anyway, what was the main cause of the high cost of our system? **This is an important part**. It isn't free-loading ER walk-ins that are making my hospital visits so expensive. It's the incentives of the system that make it so *nobody* has any reason to be efficient. We have a 3-party payment system. Person A pays Insurance Company B to Pay for doctor  &  hospital C for whatever treatments A wants to get. As an example, you go into the doctor with a broken ankle. Before this mess, the doctor would say *\"Yep, that's a sprained ankle. I'll wrap it; take some Advil as you need and stay off it for two weeks\"*. You pay him $40 for his time and you both go on your way. Now, the doctor says: *\"That's a sprained ankle. But I want to get a* [$1000] *MRI to be sure.\"* Because he doesn't want to get sued if you actually have a broken bone. This is called defensive medicine. You say: *\"How much would that cost me?\"* and he says that your insurance covers it, so you say *\"Okay!*\". A $50 visit just became a $1500 visit unnecessarily because the doctor doesn't want to get sued, and you have no reason to say no to an extra and costly test, because it doesn't affect your bottom line. The 3 party payment system insulates choices from consequence. None of us and individually incentivize to care about our health cost. Then we all complain when we all (rationally) act wasteful, because we're paying for all this extra care whether we use it or not. So the question is what does the Affordable Care Act Do? It solidifies the 3-party system. Mandating people buy insurance, and mandating a minimum amount of coverage an insurance plan covers. This includes 50-year-old bachelors paying for pregnancy and mammograms, incidentally. Next, to 'reduce' health costs on the old, they mandate that two people can't pay more than ~3x difference for the same coverage. Now a lung transplant costs the same for me as it does for an 80-year-old smoker. But he's 10x as *likely* to need it. So normally the little part of his payment that goes towards lung transplant coverage should be 10x mine. But it can only be 3x. So my costs are artificially inflated and his deflated until our prices get within those bounds. *This* is socializing medicine - when you have to pay for the average health of the group, rather than pay for the average health of a bunch of clones of you. But wait, this will make healthcare *very* expensive for healthy young kids making very little money just starting out. Especially the ones who were skipping on health insurance to start with. To cover this issue, we add in 'subsidies'. Which adds up to a lot of distorted prices, further insulation of cost, and less choice. So the reason I personally dislike it, is because it had to have this hybrid system to get passed period. And this hybrid system further institutionalizes the very problems that make out healthcare prohibitively expensive. **TL:DR** 3-party system tells everybody to be wasteful with their healthcare service, thinking they're spending other people's money even though it loops back around to them. ACA institutionalizes that, socializes costs by diverting your insurance payment from your predicted healthcare costs, and adds a ton of new subsidized healthcare users to the Federal Dole while throwing a great big bureaucracy on top of a sixth of the economy. There is no world where all of this results in a net gain for the population at large. And as millions of people are getting coverage they liked canceled, they're getting new coverage which is less good, in a smaller network, for a higher cost. And those are among the ~10 million independently insured people. When people who get insurance through their business - when those insurance plans have to comply, you'll see the same thing happen to those ~50 million plans. Tens of millions of people will suffer the same fate. Which is why our President is delaying the mandate unilaterally (without consent of congress despite no provision for such a delay) until after the 2014 election. The 2014 election will be disastrous for Democrats because every single Democrat Senator voted for it, and only democrats voted for it. They can't run away from the disaster, and their majority in the Senate is threatened, so they have to delay the disaster. This is a small taste of the practical and political complaints about the ACA. The TLDR of the TLDR is that it's too complicated, and doesn't actually solve any problems. It just makes us pay our health insurance by funneling money through the government first. 3-party free system into a 4-party coerced system. It will implode when the Business mandate is finally implemented and the majority of Americans actually finally get to experience Obamacare."}]}

Even worse, ice is *reflective*. When the energy from the sun hits dirt instead of ice, more of it is absorbed, and less is reflected. That causes the earth to heat even more. Finally, change the configuration of ice around the world can change weather patterns.

Specifically, that films are almost always at 24 frames per second, and much TV (though this is changing) and home video is shot at 30 frames per second or 60i (60 half frames per second, essentially). Have you seen a movie on display at best buy that looked like a soap opera or live production? That's because they have frame interpolation on, which interpolates (fakes, basically) extra frames to smooth out the motion. This makes it look like something shot at a higher frame rate. Films also often use somewhat slower shutter speeds (the length of time the camera iris is open per frame) then videos, often 1/48th or a multiple of this, which gives a distinct look. Color correction and proper lighting also play major roles, along with focal depth (most cinema films deliberately focus on specific parts of the frame for effect - they don't have to though, watch Citizen Kane and you'll note almost everything is in focus much of the time)."}]}

I think that our subconscious mind hears, and is aware of, whatever noise occurs around us as we sleep, and it is our subconscious mind that 'chooses' which sounds it will allow to filter into our awareness. I'm a really heavy sleeper, REALLY heavy sleeper. I've had roommates come home from the bars with tons of people and have loud parties in my house that didn't wake me. But I had one roommate come home one night and quietly grab a quick snack from the kitchen that did wake me. The partying, regardless of the varying levels of noise entering a silent house never even stirred me, while I woke up in alarm at the gentle almost-silent opening of the kitchen cabinets. My subconscious heard the partying, but designated it as harmless, while it designated the sound of someone attempting to be quiet and sneaking around the kitchen as an intruder. I've slept through fire alarms, loud music and every alarm clock known to man, but have been woken by a cat meowing at me or a branch lightly tapping my window. I can and have slept in brightly-lit lecture halls, overcrowded subways, and pretty much any loud environment you can imagine. I never have a problem falling or staying asleep.

Both of these things are proven experimentally and most famous example are GPS satellites which were highly inaccurate before these effects were accounted for. --- Backwards time travel works too, but only in equatioms.

We have, perhaps, one example of values which might be truly random, which are measurements which can be taken on the quantum level. However, it is possible that these are not **actually** random, but are just impossible for us to predict, and if we knew the starting conditions and the method by which the values are changed, we might be able to guess them. Functionally, what 'random' number generators really provide is either practically *unpredictable* numbers (in the case of cryptographic RNGs) or numbers that are less unpredictable but which are suitable for, say, games, which need to make the different possible values are all likely to be hit at some point. In the case of cryptographic randomness, they use events, such as keystrokes, the current time, packets on the network card, etc, to use as inputs to the random number generator. These would be incredibly hard to reproduce or guess anywhere else, so the numbers that come out are unpredictable and thus 'random' for practical purposes. In the case of non-cryptographic RNGs, a seed number is used as the starting point. This is often saved so that debugging can happen when replaying, say, a game to find out what values are being sent out. The RNG seed number is sometimes saved in games to make sure that reloading at the same point gets similar outputs each time."}]}

Say one employee worked 80 hours in a week. The law requires that additional hours after 40 get paid time-and-a-half, so the extra 40 hours is paid as though it were 60 hours.

Instead, the employer keeps their costs down - both in terms of labor and costs of operating the building (someone working 80 hours is going to be doing overnight shifts) - by hiring a second employee to work side-by-side. Now they're down to paying 80 hours of wages for 80 hours of work. There are also laws in some cases where certain benefits are required to be granted to an employee who works more than a certain number of hours per week. These benefits cost money for the company to offer. If the company doesn't want to incur *that* cost, they may hire more workers and reduce hours to just below that threshold. Again, that's a cost savings to the employer, but it reduces the income that worker can take home from that one job. --- Simply put, most companies just can't offer more hours to their workers. So, low-income workers take more than one job so they can work more hours and take home more income."}]}

I'm sorry, but it's international intrigue and politics. The French maintain special relationships with their former colonies (that didn't stage armed rebellions to oust them). It's understood that if you are the President of a former French-colony in Africa like the Ivory Coast and you're facing a rebel army, the Foreign Legion will assist you and possibly even the actual French Army. Fast forward to present day: The Western world is entirely fed-up with the desire in many islamic countries to instill Sharia law and rebuild some sort of Caliphate. Terrorist organizations thrive in these countries and they threaten the international rule of law while committing atrocities left and right. At the same time, the United States simply doesn't have the political will to intervene in *yet another* Muslim country, let alone Sub-Saharan Africa. It needs another war like it needs a shotgun to the head. In comes France. Its status as the former colonial overseer gives it the unique ability to intervene at the behest of the Malian government. France isn't a NATO member (they left in 1966), but it still maintains close military ties with the organization. France's NATO connections allow it to intervene with some support from the Germans (sending medical support) as well as some limited logistical support from NATO countries. The French citizenry don't seem to mind because much of the fighting is done by the French Foreign Legion, which is primarily manned by foreign applicants. There used to be rules against Frenchmen joining the Legion. **But why is Mali important?** Well, the rebels in Mali are closely aligned with Al Qaeda and are members of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) which could develop the ability to plan large attacks if left unmolested. After some [unbelievably bad messaging by the rebels]( URL_0 ) in which they ransacked the very beginnings of West African Islam for being \"insufficiently Islamic\", the international community realized this was the African Taliban.

The butterfly effect does not convey the notion\u2014as is often misconstrued\u2014that the flap of the butterfly's wings causes the tornado. The flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't.

{"id": "30k3v1", "input": "Why does every steam game I install need to install it's own copy of directx?", "output": [{"answer": "Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist. Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run. Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.

This means: He is the effective \"Head-Of-State\" in the Catholic World (I.e. someone else does the day to day running but he is the figure head). However he can become \"Commander-in-Chief\" if he needs to be and says \"As the pope - I decree that all Catholics believe this\". And this boils down to WHY Catholics have a pope - to ultimately decide what the Catholic Churches teachings/beliefs are. For example with the abortion stance - the pope would have instigated a series of discussions, consulting on the advice of Scientific experts, to understand and establish when 'life' is created. The pope would then decide, based upon the advice and opinions of his subordinates and scientists, that life begins when the Sperm hits the Egg and therefore Abortion is wrong and Catholic teaching should reflect this. This is all done behind closed doors and this gives the appearance of the pope/Church just pulling ideas out their arse. But the idea is that this prevents a split in the Church and it is a unified message that as a Catholic you either accept or not - hence why Catholicism has Confirmation (The Act of Confirming that the religion your parents brought you up in - is now yours. And now that you have been taught what it means to be catholic you agree with it). However splits do happen - Protestant churches represent splits away from the Pope. e.g. King Henry became head of the Church in England so that he could conduct a divorce that the Pope was not willing to grant. Other churches broke away for a variety of different reasons, but ultimately are saying they do not agree with the authority that the Pope is given."}]}

This is part of the reason why you see some old people eat their food while it's scalding hot, or they add a lot more salt and sugar to things; their palate is not as sensitive as it was before and they need more \"flavoring\" to get the same sensation. The same thing happens when people frequently ingest really hot (as in temperature) foods or smoke often. The repeated damage (as slight as it might be perceived) will take its toll and those people will need to use more seasoning to get the same flavor.

After years of pondering the implications of the various schools of thought, I was able to prove through a series of thought experiments and mathematical formula that both states exist at the same time and in harmony with each other. While I can not explain Sam Harris theory in the manner you have requested, I can provide you with an accurate description of free will based on the physical universe without the problem of human perception tainting the process. Imagine an ancient alien race from another universe, a universe that ended it's natural life long before our universe came into being. This alien raced was advanced enough to survive the end of their universe and became transcendent beings that went on to colonize hundreds of thousands of universes. One of this races favorite past times is recording and logging the birth of a new universe. Imagine now that they record the birth of our universe in all its detail. They have defined every single element that makes up our universe, and have a complete database of it. Using this gathered data, they would be able to create a model of our universe that they could manipulate to their own end. Using the models to create a series of simulations and given enough processing power the alien race could then map out every single possible eventuality of our universe. Here's the kicker. See while they may be able to map out every single possible eventuality, they will not know which eventuality is reality until it actually happens. With nearly all the processes of the universe, the actual outcome of the reality is random happenstance. This is where the math comes in, which I am not going to get into right now, but there are several avenues of conventional mathematics you can explore that describe the random nature of our universe if you desire more information Now comes the introduction of life into the mix, and by extension free will. Life forms have the very unique privilege of being able determine the outcome of the reality around them. Understand that this alien races wouldn't just have your current life defined. Your entire life, everything you have ever done, everything you could have ever done, everything you could potentially do, has been predetermined by the physical nature of the universe. Thanks to free will however, we as living beings have the unique privilege of getting to choose which of our potential eventualities come to pass. Of course it's not quite that simple. We are not accounting for outside influence which effect the decision making processes. For our general understanding of the fundamental concepts however it's not necessary to get into that much detail. Before I end my lecture I will propose an experiment that anyone can try at home. Go to an area with some space and stand still. Now you are going to make one quarter turn in a direction of your choice. Random chance would suggest that there is a 50-50 chance you will turn left or right. For the purpose of this basic experiment we will ignore outside factors. Now make another quarter turn in the direction of your choice. Continue to make quarter turns in whatever direction you choose. As you make turns the odds of the direction of your turns will change depending on the direction you turned in previous turns. Random chance would keep your turn rate at 50-50, and most processes in the universe work in such a manner. In fact, if you have a friend counting for you, and you made 500 quarter turns while they logged the directions of your turn, and you did not keep track of your turns, then it would stand to reason that you would keep a balanced ratio of turns. While doing this you may find that the results are not balanced for you. If this is the case you may wish to consider outside factors such left handed vs right handed. Once you have defined the contributing factors and accounted for the effect they have on your ratio of turns you will see that your turns are still consistent with the random nature of the universe. Now lets bring free will into the mix. Turn 10 times in a row in a single direction. What are the odds of that happening naturally? Now do it 100 times in a row. In doing so you will become, in your own living room, an exceptional force in the universe. The odds of such an occurrence happening naturally are staggering. Eventually, if you were to turn in the same direction long enough, you would reach a point where the odds are no random process in the lifetime of the universe would naturally turn that way. Free will however makes such a process almost commonplace. Tldr - free will and pre-determination exist in harmony. If you think you have no free will turn around in a circle a hundred times in a row."}]}

Even the harmful ones aren't always bad. Our bodies are constantly killing bad cells. Any parasites or bacteria are generally put to the death quite quickly by our bodies defenses. If a fish shows any telltale signs of being unhealthy, then these fish are not used for sushi. If a fish looks real good, it's cut up and shipped to a restaurant or market. We have figured out VERY well how to tell if a fish is not healthy. We also know exactly how to make things even healthier by caring for it properly. Sushi fish is treated VERY well, and cared for as if a tiny baby. If a person does not treat the fish properly, it can get contaminated from almost anywere. If someone touches it without gloves, drops something on it, or lets it sit out too long, the bacteria could start to grow. If the bacteria is given time to sit and multiply on a tasty piece of fish, it'll start growing into a colony. One bacteria is easy to kill, but millions are much harder. Sushi is expensive because of the work that humans put into making it perfectly safe to eat. Often, not always, fish is put into a special freezer that won't harm the fish's taste but will kill the tiny parasites that are harmful for humans."}]}

Why does it become an FBI concern when the woman happens to be an actress?", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of people are talking about money and things like \"upper class\", and while that might have something to do with it there are plenty of other reasons to pay special attention to this case. First of all, and perhaps most importantly, this was a highly organized leak. Most cases of leaked nude pictures are from ex-partners or the occasional stole phone. While that's horrible for the person who's victimized, this **is** different. The leaks were probably obtained by a substantial hacking operation. Public figures were targeted and the pictures sold on the online black market (also known by the now popularized term \"deep web\"). This wasn't a case of someone forgetting to put their album on photobucket as private, this is looking more and more like an organized group of people making their way into very specific people's cloud storage accounts. Obviously these people need to be stopped before they illegally access and leak more pictures, since it's clear they have the capacity to do so. The fact that these pictures were sold, not just posted online, makes it a lot worse. The crime is also worsened by the fact that these people were public figures. The pictures got massive attention, spread to millions of people and ruined the actresses carers. The economical fallout for these people are probably in the range of millions of dollars (might be hard to get a role in the next Disney movie if your sex tapes are available online). Financial loss (not financial resources) makes a difference when it comes to our justice system, and rightly so. Also, as this is a highly publicized leak it adds pressure on the FBI to actually act, as people will be demanding these hackers be held responsible. If not it will damage the credibility of the FBI and the government. So we have these factors to explain it: - Massive leak - Highly organized - Profit-driven hacking - Hacking into a system were millions of people store sensitive material (call them dumb, but that's how it is) - Massive fallout and economical loss for the victims - Big pressure on the justice system to find and punish those responsible due to massive attention and outrage over the leaks. The FBI does, as some people have pointed out in this thread, also investigate cases were ordinary people's pictures are leaked online. Those cases and investigations just don't get the same attention. Just because this is the first time you've heard about the FBI doing an investigation doesn't mean its the first time its happening. To all the people complaing, I ask you this: Would you have thought higher of the FBI if they failed to investigate this? Should actresses not be protected by the law because they have money? Should the gravity of the situation not matter when deciding how much resources to spend on an investigation? Because this is a grave situation, far worse for the victims because of their careers."}]}
{"id": "kscdh", "input": "What exactly is time?", "output": [{"answer": "**Like You Are 5:** You are *always* moving through Time at approximately the speed of light. When you speed up, you begin to move through time less slowly. This is why it is technically possible to time-travel (though we can only go into the future at this point). Therefore, Time is our relative experience of moving through the fourth dimension. We can alter it by going faster and faster. If you were theoretically to accelerate yourself to 99.99% the speed of light, you would experience time-travel, where a few seconds go by for you, and perhaps tens to hundreds of years go by in the 'outside' world. **Like You Are 12:** When people call time \"the fourth dimension\", they are being technically correct. Basically, try to imagine the following in your head. If I wanted to, using some coordinate system, find a specific moment in space and time, I could write it as so: (X,Y,Z,T) where X,Y,Z are the dimensions you are familar with (height, width, depth). It is important to note that our distinction of X,Y,Z are completely arbitrary and based solely on our perception of the world. For the sake of this next part, just imagine that moving from place to place is simply moving in some direction (let's just say X). Time is the fourth dimension, as stated above. Essentially, what makes time 'time' is the fact that at this very moment, you and I are both moving through the 'time' dimension at *the speed of light*. Now when I move in the X-axis dimension (which again is an arbitrary direction), I am taking some of my speed away from Time, and giving it to the movement in the X-axis. If you want a visual, imagine a compass in your head where the needle is pointing straight ahead. In this image, you are sitting still, but still flying through time at the speed of light in the Time direction. When you start to move in any other direction (e.g. our spacial dimensions), you start to take some of your speed away from the Time direction, and give it to the spacial direction. Visually, this would look like the needle on the compass creeping left/right away from being perfectly straight. If I am on the space station moving 5 km/s, I am moving a tiny fraction of the speed of light. In the above compass scenario, my compass needle is slightly to the left/right. Thus, I am moving more slowly through time. This is why you have probably heard of something along the lines of time-travel and astronauts. Astronauts who spend a sufficient amount of time on the space station come back to Earth having aged ever so slightly less (I am talking microseconds less here). This is, again, because they were moving in the spacial dimensions at a fraction the speed of light. Thus, in the Time direction, they moved ever so much more slowly. Our perception of time stems from this phenomenon, which now that you have reached the end, I am proud to say that you now understand the bare-bones basics of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity."}]}

Dirt is surprisingly complex and is very important for plant life. The soil of earth has millions of microbes and small life forms that help play a roll in making it a good environment for plants to grow in. There are many different elements required bust some of the important ones include Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium. Not only do these elements have to be there they have to be in the right form. On earth almost all of the nitrogen in the soil is from some microbes called nitrogen fixing bacteria. These little guys take all the elemental N2 in the atmosphere and change it into other compounds of nitrogen (most commonly ammonia and nitrates). Plants are adapted to absorb these. In addition to just the chemical composition there are other factors such as the pH level of the soil. The soil sampled by the pheonix lander in 2008 tested the soil and found the pH to be 8.3 which is quite basic (bad). As many plants are very sensitive to soil pH.

The poorest still don't have enough to survive and are viewed as labor (or if they're homeless absolutely useless). Our punishment system still ravages poor communities, breaking up families and making it very difficult for the primary wage earners to provide for their family.

So there are usually not many bullets being fired at the detainee, and bullets don't have a 100% kill rate either. The electric chair and the gas chamber both cause a fairly drawn out death, again deemed as cruel and unusual. The injection has a good success rate and causes a quick and seemingly painless death as the detainee is put to sleep first and then the lethal dose is administered. Since it's intravenous, it gets to work straight away and they're dead pretty quick. Tl;dr - Gas, Electric, Firing squad, Noose are not all 100% effective and cause pain and suffering. For some reason causing pain and suffering to somebody who rightfully deserves it is not right."}]}

The next day the Bar Association president called him demanding he retract his statement. Henry called the newspaper and said to the editor \"I was wrong, please retract the 90% and replace it with 95%\". I once stopped a guy on a middle-of-the-night drug and alcohol fueled rampage with a gun after fighting with him for 17 minutes while the cops waited up the street. I interviewed 30 lawyers to take my manslaughter case, brought by an inexperienced ladder-climbing prosecutor, and only found 2 CRIMINAL DEFENSE attorneys I would trust. (Do NOT use a 'jack of all trades' attorney for a criminal case). Your lawyer has the obligation to defend you vigorously but also to know enough to make every single objection that they can. If the judge gets mad or threatens them, that's how you'll know they are doing their job. It's important to make those objections in case an appeal is necessary. In my case it was not. It was a bad case to begin with and that prosecutor ended up back in traffic court after a completely embarrassing loss. If you're in real trouble, first rule, never talk; that's what your 5th amendment is for. Go to jail, take the preliminary lumps you have to take, but don't talk. That's what I did and my lawyer said it made things much easier because the police and prosecutors had no words to twist. By not talking only one story emerges in the end. Secondly, in response to 'slash', to the prosecutor I was \"obviously\" guilty. To the jury I was obviously innocent."}]}
{"id": "jatvv", "input": "The history of Canada", "output": [{"answer": "Technically, we are 'constitutionally independent', but we are not a republic. Technically, we are a 'Dominion'. This means we are self-governing and can make up our own minds regarding national and international issues and how we involve ourselves. Prior to this, we basically had to do whatever the crown told us. (ie. Go to War.) It also often made Canadians second-class citizens in the eyes of the English (ie. 'from the Colonies'). Currently, our Head of State is the Queen (or Reigning Monarch), represented by a Governor-General, and his/her Lieutenant (Pronounced 'Leftenant') Governors, one for each Province/Territory. The GG's role is... nominal at best, but is maintained for the sake of show and tradition. In reality we are government by Federal Provincial and Municipal (where there are some) governments. The head of the Federal Government is the Prime Minister, who is elected from within whichever party has the most seats (not always the majority of seats, though presently, the current government is made up of a Conservative Majority). The provincial governments are similar, with both federal and provincial govts. made up of multiple parties which generally boil down to: Liberals, Conservatives, NDP (Moderates... ish), Greens, and Bloc Quebecois (think ethno-centrists whose platform is largely based on separation of Quebec and Canada). Provincial heads of government are 'Premiers'. Municipal governments are based on towns, counties or both, depending on how the province is broken down. Federal law trumps Provincial which trumps Municipal. We elect our government by party, not leader (though its often pretty clear who the leader is going to be), and seem to do it very frequently. That said, we are still a commonwealth country and enjoy certain benefits and relationships as a result. As for the broader history of Canada, its a rich tapestry woven from many different cultures, though predominantly the Scottish, English and French (see Quebecois and Acadian, for a start), as well as, obviously, many, many Native ethnicities. Much of Canada was opened up by the fur trade, and the associated industries that sprang off them. Wiki The North West Company and/or the Hudson's Bay Company (they eventually merged) - The HBC is the world's oldest corporation, and at one time basically owned the majority of Canada. Their industry essentially recruited natives to provide animal furs in exchange (often at outrageous and exploitative rates) for Western and/or manufactured goods like linen, knives, axes, tools, guns, sugar, flour, etc. Western explorers also pushed back the boundaries of the frontier by exploring Canada via waterways; travelling in the native fashion with canoes and portaging where they could not. Eventually this was fleshed out completely by the railroad, which ultimately spanned Canada East to West, and opened up additional resources, such as timber, Gold (and other minerals) and linked the two sides of Canada. Traditionally, this railroad and its many, many assets were owned by Canada Pacific Railway, which, like the HBC, is now, sadly, a shadow of its former glory, though that glory can still be seen in the hotels they erected along the way, such as Chateau Lac Louise in Alberta, the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa, and a few others I dont remember. In terms of military history, Canada has an excellent war museum, in Ottawa, which is worth visiting and sums it up nicely. In brief, Canadian warfare has (chronologically) included a variety of conflicts with the natives, the French - who had originally colonized much of Canada but were essentially kicked out by the British, especially at such battles as the Plains of Abraham and Louisbourg. Many of the French were exiled back to France (despite being multiple-generation 'Canadians'.) others were resettled, giving rise to pocket communities like the Acadians in Nova Scotia. Canadians also fought in a variety of other international wars, including in Russia during the revolution there (though IIRC they didnt do too much), the Boer War in South Africa, WW1 and WW2. In WW1 they accomplished incredible things at terrible costs; more Canadians died in WWI than WWII. For highlights, look up Vimy Ridge (an entrenched fortification held by the Germans that had held off (and slaughtered) everyone else for years, that the Canadians essentially took in a day, by using their heads), Passchendaele and many, many others. In WWII Canadians fought alongside the British from the outset, in Africa, and later in Italy, France and Holland - which they later liberated. Most Americans have heard of the Normandy landings; what most dont know is that the landings took place on five separate beachheads. The Americans took one two(Omaha and Utah) the British, with the Free French, took two (Sword and Gold), and the Canadians took the Fifth (Juno) and most heavily defended. We also burned down the White House once. **edit1 - adding more detail**"}]}

The glass surface and metal surface are titled with respect to each other. Usually, you are looking at the strong reflection from the metal surface. When you adjust the mirror at night, you align the mirror so that you are now looking at the weak reflection from the glass surface and not the strong reflection from the metal. You need a weaker reflection at night because you need your eyes adjusted to low-light levels to see the streets, but the headlamps of the car behind you are very bright and will destroy your visual night-adaptation if you see a strong reflection of them. Glass always reflects a little bit of the light.

{"id": "3moexi", "input": "How are old films and photograph's, that are old, grainy and captured on film, restored to 1080p HD?", "output": [{"answer": "Several steps actually. As others have noted, good film has been better than 4k for quite some time. Modern Super 35 (that's a size measurement) is about 7k in resolution, the 65mm that is used by people like Tarantino is about 14k. For these a scan of the film is all that necessary. For those that don't have the resolution they actually scale it up. They rely on the fact that most people sit too far away from their TV to even properly tell 720p, so upscaling everything to 1080p just gives them advertising rights to say that it is in Full HD. For special films they actually go through and can basically rebuild everything. Really what they are doing is building visual effects that look identical. This was used extensively in the 4k work on Taxi Driver. For this they focus almost exclusively on the places that are in focus, since that is where you will be looking. It is only the major artifacts in the background that are redone. This is simply to save a lot of money. The basic work is very quick and inexpensive, a full movie can be done for under $5000. The more in depth ones cost far more, the Taxi Driver 4k was alleged to cost roughly $100,000. Edit: It occurred to me that you may want an explanation of how the film scanning works. Start with the sensor from a DSLR camera (we will change this later). Now if we can lay the film precisely on top of the camera sensor, the sensor will see the film and we get the image. The problem is that sensors are actually very rough microscopically and touching then destroys them. We need something to protect the sensor. On top of the sensor we place a very precise lens system. Film glides over glass very well, and now we don't touch the sensor. So we precisely align a single frame of the movie on the lens over the sensor. Shine a very precise amount of light through and we capture the image perfectly. For modern celluloid this can be done at 18 frames per second, for highest quality, if speed is important 48 frames per second are possible. For old fragile celluloid the speed is slowed way down, with very old films I have heard of speeds as low as 1 frame every 5 seconds. So that's the basic, and is how the \"cheap\" ones work, cheap here is $20,000. However with some changes we can greatly improve quality. The first, most common, change is to replace the sensor. Instead of a Bayer pattern sensor, like a DSLR has, we use a prism with 3 sensors a sensor each for red, green, and blue. Now we get a full resolution image for each color. This is probably the most widespread method. However, if we sacrifice some speed, and use the latest LEDs, we can reduce cost, and maintain quality. Remember in our first setup we used a color sensor. Instead use a black and white sensor. Black and white sensors are the sharpest, most accurate, most reliable sensors available. Now we get a black and white image. But if we shine just a carefully controlled red LED through the film we will get just the reds information. We do the same for green and blue. Now we have three images for a single frame, one each for red, green, and blue. This is basically the next generation technology for film scanning. It offers greater control, the highest quality, and is the cheapest price. Once all the individual frames are scanned. Then the scan goes through color correction where a skilled technician carefully adjust dozens of parameters to deliver the correct color for the film. This colorist job is standard across both digital and film capture."}]}

Your household socket is shaped differently than your car's accessory socket because they support different types of power delivery, and the *products* that use them *expect* a specific type of power delivery. Have you ever tried to plug something in at home and the plug will only insert one way, while other items seem to work either way? That's because your home socket is shaped so that products that need to can guarantee that they are connected in a certain way. Likewise, you can't plug your coffee maker into your dashboard because the coffee maker expects a certain voltage, power delivery mechanism, and minimum available amperage--none of which is commonly available in a car. Without serious effort or amazing oversight, you will never be able to plug your vacuum cleaner into a socket that cannot provide the power to run it, and you will never be able to plug your car charger into a socket that would overload your phone."}]}

Tor is a darknet: It encrypts your data, breaks it up, and sends it through multiple computers (who are also running Tor) and then finally lets the data leave and join the 'normal' Internet. The purpose being that it would be very difficult (but not impossible) for anyone to find out who really did or said what. Because your data has to be sent and resent by many computers, it will be much slower than accessing the Internet normally -- and probably not fast enough to make it useful for streaming video content -- but it provides the best protection for people who NEED to be anonymous. There are also websites ending in .onion instead of .com that are hosted within the Tor darknet. Because the data never leaves the darknet it's much more secure. But these websites are probably not suitable for 5 year olds! Criminality, scamming and illegal adult content are rife. But that's the price of a truly free, anonymous network. there are also whistle-blowing, wikileaks and political .onion sites. As a last note, running Tor as a server could mean that your computer could appear to download or do something nasty even though you didn't do it. You would be unable to tell who the real perpetrators were and depending on where you live, it could get you in trouble."}]}

There's a great book called \" [A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23]( URL_0 ) \" where he discusses what sheep are like. I think he goes too far in trying make the analogy work, though that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. Best example of how sheep are sheep - they are so top-heavy with all their wool that they can actually fall over and get stuck on their back like a turtle. They stay stuck like that and can die within a matter of hours due to gas buildup in their gut or something. Add heat of the day and it gets worse. Other sheepy thing: Shepherds the world over will break the leg of a sheep that stray too far or do not respond to the shepherd's voice. They then have to carry the sheep around with them until the leg heals. This stops the sheep from running off cliffs (which they often do), and it allows the sheep to learn the shepherd's voice/trust the shepherd, etc. Goats, like others have said, are jerks. Generally. Story from a missionary friend - On a mission trip, the people in the village were making the missions team dinner. The men and women on the team were always asked if they would like to assist, and they usually agreed. This involved the women getting to actually butcher a chicken or two on a daily basis - new for all of them - but the people in the village decided to make stew from goat and lamb one night. So, my friend was asked to butcher them and he agreed. The goat went first. It was a small, young one, and that thing fought while being chased, fought while caught, fought while it bled out, fought until death. Then the lamb went. Didn't need to be chased. Didn't disagree with being picked up. When my friend laid the lamb on the table, on its side, it didn't fight or move. It didn't even make a sound when it was cut.

Why you may ask? Let's rewind back to 2011, Intel just released their 2nd gen of core i3/i5/i7 CPUs and AMD needed to respond. AMD's response to the market is their Bulldozer line of CPUs, Bulldozer failed because it was made with too much emphasis on multi-core performance and as a result, Bulldozer CPU's single core performance were horrible. Combine that with the fact that most programs at the time did not support multi-core CPUs, AMD gave way for Intel. Fast forward to 2014 and Intel knew that AMD weren't a threat anymore, as a result Intel gotten lazy at generational improvements, causing them to \"milk\" the CPU market for time to come. Fast forward to the present and AMD needs to respond badly, and Zen is their last ditch effort at it.

A cattle rancher named Cliven Bundy has been in the southern Nevada area for a long time and is using federal land and allowing his cows to eat the grass. This guy claims that he paid for and inherited rights to use this federal property for his cattle's purposes. Up until two decades ago, there was little or no issue with what he was doing. In fact, he says he was paying the state of Nevada to manage the land, whatever the hell that means. Around that time, the Bureau of Land Management started trying to assess fees for grazing, which Bundy wouldn't pay because he felt he was reimbursing them for driving his cattle off the land, and push his cattle off the land, stating that his cattle were trampling the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise. Now, the BLM has stepped up their game and has been actively rounding up Bundy's cattle, which he obviously disagrees with and doesn't like. The family has protested and at times gone a bit overboard, so the BLM setup a First Amendment Area where they could protest and not be in the way of the BLM operation. As you might have guessed, this pissed off the Bundys even more and drove even more protesting. Now the Bundys are pushing to get the BLM to leave them alone and return their cattle. Bundy is also a local militia member who rounded up his buddies and is ready to fight the government that he says is trampling on his rights. Several people have taken sides and it's unclear why this has come to a head now, but conspiracy theorists believe that there is something going on with Harry Reid and that he might be brokering a deal to setup a solar energy farm on the land.

The federal law that protects from employment discrimination says that you can refuse to hire someone based on their gender if their gender is that specific to the job. HOWEVER, Hooters has to be willing to hire male cooks, busboys, etc, because those jobs are \"behind the scenes\" and so are not protected by the Hooters = women thing. Basically, it works because Hooters' entire brand is based on hiring women as waitresses. Doesn't mean they can get away with never hiring men for OTHER jobs, and doesn't mean any restaurant could get away with it. If I had a restaurant that was 100% branded to be all about hot guys, I could legally hire only hot guys. But if I had a regular coffee shop that wasn't marked as a hot guy coffee shop, I could not legally refuse to hire women. ETA: Race is not a BFOQ, so no, you can't refuse to hire someone based on race. It's not going to fly. ETA 2: YES, EVEN FOR A MOVIE. As I have said below, race is not a BFOQ even for movies, but physical characteristics associated with race are okay in some circumstances, and yes, it is a big complicated mess. When the law was passed in the 1960s, the Senators who wrote a sort of guide to the law (which does not carry the same legal weight as the law but is considered by judges interpreting the law) said while the law says race is not a BFOQ, physical characteristics that go along with race might be in the case of a movie. Later judges have said that this means you can't base your hiring of actors based on race, but you can based on physical characteristics. In the words of one judge, \"A film director casting a movie about African-American slaves may not exclude Caucasians from the auditions, but the director may limit certain roles to persons having the physical characteristics of African-Americans.\""}]}

{"id": "2es05y", "input": "What is it like to have a sense of smell?", "output": [{"answer": "Many of the responses here deal with the emotional response that smelling something produces. I think that's good, but I prefer digging deeper, since there's still a link in the chain there that's missing, and that is the actual physical perception of smell. I'm sure that you know what it feels like to have the emotional experiences that the people are talking about, so that isn't explaining anything that you don't already experience or know, so a more detailed description of how the stimuli presents itself to your awareness is in order, I think. /u/pyr666 does a good job of comparing it to touch, since that makes a link between your experience of touch and what it feels like to smell. Maybe that's just my take on it though, since I can understand how all sense is in a spectrum and that they cross over from time to time (I'm a mild synesthete). To me, extreme hot and extreme cold are similar to white, which are similar a loud trumpet playing its highest possible note, which is similar to very strong and distinct tastes like pure lemon. To me, they all share the property of being \"high energy\" because they present themselves to my awareness such that I'm keenly aware of them and they can't be ignored. In the same way, some smells have that same kind of spectrum of \"can't ignore\" - they \"shock\" your nervous system - often in a specific way. A very bright point of light to your vision is like a sharp needle to your touch, which is like a squirt of lemon juice or wasabi to your taste, and perhaps like vinegar to smell. That's generally what sour smells (and tastes) are like. Then there are those at the other end of the spectrum - tastes and smells that aren't overpowering, but that you need to pay attention to your sense to make it known to your attention. This is like the smallest amount of hair on your arm being moved but you just barely register it in your sense of touch. Similarly, colours that are hard to distinguish such as very pale colors or very dark colours may blend together and not be as distinct or catching to your awareness. In terms of smell, you might say this is like the smell of something fairly muted, like the smell of paper or sand. Bitter, as both a taste and a smell, to most people, is not pleasant if too strong, and might even be said to be painful and presents itself to your awareness with a kind of sense of immediacy, like being overwhelmed by looking at the sun (that sense of needing to look away), or pull away in the case of getting a deep papercut. Sharp spices like cinnamon are like having the blood flow back into your hand and you get pins and needles - many tiny bursts of individual neurons. Like the tickle you get in your nose when you're just about to sneeze, but milder and more diffuse. For more complex smells, such as where someone invites you to try to smell the different \"notes\" in a wine, it usually has a very strong sensation of one sort (usually the alcohol or the sourness of grapes) which makes it very difficult to make out the other smells - like trying to pick out the clarinet with a tuba blaring beside it (one drowns out the other, or makes it necessary to search harder for it). Some smells \"feel\" pleasant, like silk caressing your skin (such as the smell of butter or vanilla), or \"warm\" like the feeling of warmth on your skin after being out in the cold (such as the smell of freshly baked bread). These smells generally produce an immediate effect on your body of making your muscles relax, or to feel tingly all over. Similar to medium-saturation warm colors like yellow, orange, and red. Blue and green colors are like fresh coolness on your skin, which is the same as \"cool\" smells. The coolness of the sensations is also a relaxing one, often. A cool smell is like mint, pine, citrus because they seem to \"reset\" your sensory pallatte and don't linger long. A cool mist on your warm skin will seem to numb your skin very slightly and then cannot be felt soon after."}]}

Why does the US continue to lag behind other developed countries in spite of our (more than generous) education budget?", "output": [{"answer": "There are several reasons that higher spending doesn't always translate into better outcomes: * Underlying social problems (poor nutrition, unstable home life, low SES, lack of sleep, untreated medical conditions) affect how much students can take in, learn, and utilize. These things are factors from fetal development onwards (brain development depends on proper nutrition), and there are large segments of US society which may be overweight but are nonetheless not getting the nutrition and social support needed to grow and develop properly. * Cultural factors - the US has a profoundly anti-intellectual culture, glorifying athletes and businesspeople rather than those who devote themselves to knowledge. We look down on teachers (those who can, do; those who can't, teach), and in many states, only require teachers to have an education degree, rather than a degree in the subject they are teaching (this is not necessarily bad for those teaching younger students, but can be problematic once you get past elementary school). * Our schools are structured to teach compliance and make good workers, rather than developing creative thought or even fact-based knowledge. We focus on obeying rules (dress code, zero tolerance, don't be late for class) and observing a strict schedule (move to the next class at the bell, not when you're through with the material) - these things make good workers, but they don't necessarily reward thinking (and sometimes discourage it - if you're stuck working on a problem and the bell rings, you have to give up and move along, rather than getting the reward that comes from solving it). [Washington D.C. spends more per student on K-12 education than the rest of the country ]( URL_0 )(PDF, page 26 and 29), partially because they have fewer students than most states, but also because many of the public school students have low SES. Other states, like Mississippi/Alabama/Arkansas/Missouri, don't spend nearly as much but also have terrible education outcomes. That said, it also depends how you measure education spending. If you're throwing college costs in, you're going to skew the numbers high for the US, because it costs a lot to go to college here, and the state isn't paying all that much of the costs anymore. If you measure state funding, you're leaving out places that use local tax $$ to fund schools (and thus have very wealthy and very poor districts). It's also very difficult to compare countries across even uniform testing measurements, since populations differ so much - the US has much higher social inequality than Finland does; is it really fair to compare our education scores directly knowing that the US has many more students who face challenges due to home life (and not the educational system directly)?"}]}

The water released has huge amounts of energy, as you can see in the video. Think of all the damage that water can do when it reaches the bottom. If you just had a ramp straight down, the water would reach the downstream riverbed with huge amounts of energy, and start pushing away the soil and rocks at the bottom (causing erosion). But, so what if that stuff gets pushed away? Well the dam is a really heavy structure that's supporting lots of pressure, and so it requires a good base to stand on. If this erosion goes uncontrolled, the dam can become unsupported and lose stability, leading to a collapse. This would be catastrophic for anyone/anything that is downstream. (You can google dam collapses, that shit ain't pretty). With this in mind, spillways are designed with a big curve at the bottom called a 'ski jump'. The purpose is simple: to dissipate all of that energy flowing downstream. And tbh it also has the added benefit of looking super cool."}]}
{"id": "65knxh", "input": "Can alcoholism actually be \"passed down\" from an addicted parent, or is it just a sorry excuse people use to keep being alcoholic?", "output": [{"answer": "I assume ELI5 actually means explaining like OP is 5. So I'll give it a shot. When someone says *passed down*, they typically mean transferring a trait from parent to child. There are 2 ways this can happen. **Environmental factors** (these are things that are *outside* the body. Like home-life, parent-child relationship, type of friends, role models, all that good stuff)  &  **Genetic factors** (things that are *inside* the body. Like genes and...well mostly just genes) The potential environmental factors are obvious, so I'll spare reddit the details. Genetic factors are a little more complex. You see, the mechanism of **addiction** is in the brain. But not just in a person's thoughts and/or feelings, but *literally* in the brain. In the pink tissue inside our skulls, there are tiny receptors (think of a baseball glove) that *catch* tiny neurotransmitters which are chemicals created and released *by* and *to* other brain tissue (think of tiny baseballs). Now, drinking alcohol, for most, makes a person feel good, right? When the brain feels good like this, it releases baseballs to their respective baseball gloves. However, overdoing this will cause the brain to create more baseballs than gloves. But the brain is basically a god-damned 3d printer. So it just creates more baseball gloves for the extra baseballs. Here's where the plot twist comes in, and where alcoholism rears it's head. These gloves don't *just* catch baseballs. They catch all kinds of balls as well, such as tennis balls (seizures), golf balls (hallucinations), and ping balls (death). An alcoholic, then, has to KEEP drinking alcohol to make the brain continue to release enough **base**balls to fill up the available gloves and to prevent these random other balls from entering the gloves. These gloves have always been able to catch these random balls, but since there was always a limited number of gloves, the chances of catching a tennis ball in the middle of a baseball field was always highly unlikely. So addiction comes down to too many gloves catching the wrong balls. Now, the most common way this happens is by the pathway mentioned above: a person drinking way too much and then causing the brain to make shitload a gloves. However, genetics has a role here too. There are some folks who's brain's 3d printer is way too efficient and is programmed to build more gloves quicker. In other words, in these folks it would take less drinks to cause them to become full blown alcoholics. Also, genetics can affect how *good* a glove can catch these other balls. So if you're brain's 3d printer is building Hyuuuge gloves, then obviously that person's glove will catch more random balls. Genetics can affect any part of that terrible baseball metaphor. I'd go on, but I'm sure you're getting the point. I think we've talked about balls enough today. **Serious Note**: So, no. It's not a sorry excuse for some people. It's a real disease. Hey, from personal experience, I know how problematic dealing with alcoholics can be, but they deserve empathy and patience. Some of them were just dealt a bad hand."}]}

In science, the article might be the details and results of a new experiment; in a history journal, it might be a new theory based on re-reading a ton of old documents, etc. If we restrict the discussion to science, then articles can be of several types. A common set of types are: Full papers (a long detailed description of a new experiment/trial, and its results, together with how they affect current theories), short communications (a brief description of a new result, not important or complicated enough to need a full paper), reviews (an article going through all the existing papers on a particular subject, pointing out which are good and bad, which results are reliable and which might not be, and producing an overall conclusion about the current theories, etc.) Anyone can write a paper and submit it to a journal. Editorial staff will then look at the paper, make sure it is something that journal readers might be interested in, and then find some volunteer experts to review it. Typically, the experts will be authors who have previously submitted papers on a similar topic to the journal and had them accepted for publication. However, they might also be personally recommended to the editors, or the editors may be familiar with their expertise from other journals. The reviewers will then review the paper, and make a recommendation to the editor as to whether it should be published or not. So, who reads the journals? Anyone that is interested in the up-to-date knowledge. For science journals, that would be scientists working in that field. For medical journals, it would be doctors who need to know about the latest advances. The journals are essentially a method for people to get their results and theories out to the wider world. Some are old and have a long and prestigious history, taking care to make sure that the reviews are of good quality and that the papers are interesting and important. Some, especially these days, are little more than scams which will publish anything if you pay their \"publication fee\". The older ones were typically weekly or monthly printed magazines, but these days people prefer online subscriptions; with many of the new low cost journals being online only. One of the problems with just using number of papers published as a metric, is that it doesn't reflect on quality. A preferred metric is \"impact factor\" which is based on how many times an author's papers are cited."}]}

{"id": "jv91t", "input": "What prime numbers are and why they're important", "output": [{"answer": "I think others have covered what prime numbers are quite well. Let's talk about why they're important. First, every whole number bigger than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes--and the series of primes that represents a whole number is unique. Reducing a number to the series of primes that represent it, however is *very hard*. In fact, it's so hard that we haven't come up with a fast and consistent way of doing it that doesn't depend on trying every possible combination--or at least making educated guesses. This is particularly true of semiprimes--the product of two prime numbers. However, checking if a number is prime--and checking the factorization of prime numbers is correct--is a *very* easy thing to do. We can check 300 digit prime numbers within a fraction of a second using computers! Now, one thing we can do is use two very large prime numbers to scramble messages--as all messages can be encoded as numbers. What's more, the way we scramble it means that I could hand you one number to use to scramble the message you want to send me, while I keep one that de-scrambles that message. It doesn't matter how many people know about the number I give you: as long as it takes several hundred computers two years to factorize a large semiprime (large here meaning more than 200 digits), nobody's going to calculate *my* number using yours. This process is called asymmetric key encryption (or public key encryption). Why is this important? Every time you want to make a purchase online, you want to make sure that bad guys don't get your credit card number. Websites use asymmetric key encryption to ensure that bad guys listening to your Internet connection cannot get your credit card number and take trips to Thailand with your money. Banks use similar methods to ensure that bank-to-bank electronic money transfers are secure and that bank robbers can't take their money by tapping into an Internet connection. The military uses it to pass its orders around so that enemies can't see the military's plans. Indeed, the Nazis lost the war at least in part to the fact that their message scrambling wasn't as secure as they thought. But you didn't ask about how computers were invented, so we'll save that story for another time."}]}

I believe Mulholland drive is about a young woman who comes to Hollywood to become an actress, at the start her name is betty(blonde). The brunette is her alter ego type character who is confused at the start but guides Betty to adapt to the corruption and fakeness of Hollywood, which explains the theatre scene where we are shown the need for illusion as a movie star. As the movie star persona takes over, the innocent blonde girl suffers and becomes jealous of her her alter ego (everyone knowing her movie star personality and not her true personality, as we see at the fancy dinner near the end where the blonde is like a helpless bystander). She and the director both came to Hollywood to make art but find success only when they go along with the corruption. The dead body is a vision of the death of her innocence later in the film. I'm not sure about the hobo, he may just represent the hidden underbelly of hollywood: giving up your innocence in order to become a movie star, which would explain why he was in procession of the blue box which transforms the actress into a star earlier in the film. There isn't much importance in deciphering what is real or fake, dream/awake in my opinion, its more of a commentary on this internal struggle and corruption of art."}]}

{"id": "2vvciy", "input": "Why haven't we made ski boots that don't hurt yet?", "output": [{"answer": "Former boot tech here. In a previous life, I fitted ski boots for a living. How many pairs? I suppose I've worked on over 200 pairs of boots. I've also been a skier for 30 years, and snowboarder for perhaps 15 years. Here are my views on the subject at hand...ski boots and the fitting there of. In normal life, people wear shoes...normally runners or dress shoes. They are soft, light and flexible and are available in many sizes...usually length and sometimes width. They are made this way because feet come in a HUGE array of sizes...I've never seen 2 sets the same...and believe me, I've seen a lot. A soft shoe, while perhaps not a perfect fit to a foot, can bend, twist and adapt itself to the foot it is on. The main purpose of a shoe for most of us is to protect the very bottom of the foot when we *walk* or *run*. Not a difficult challenge. Now for skiing, you need to basically attach a 170-190cm long board to each foot. There is a *lot* of load that needs to be dealt with here...a ski provides a lot of leverage. You can't use a canvas or plastic shoe to provide this...you need to move up to stronger materials. Ski boots are made from injection molded plastic. They need to be to transfer the energy of the skier to the skis. The boot is *rigid* but the foot inside is *not*. So the challenge here is to make the inside of the boot match the foot as closely as possible, and still be able to transfer load effectively. This is the challenge! Let's look at the extremes. Let's say you took a huge boot (several sizes too big), and filled it with soft foam. Nice and comfortable for sure, but the foam will *not transfer load*. Let's look at the other extreme...a small boot...several sizes too small. You can mash your foot in there, and the energy transfer will be great, but this boot will hurt like hell, you will have cold feet, and likely hate life. Ok? The trick then, is to get the hard outer part (the shell) to fit as closely as possible. The inside part (the liner) needs to help take up the space where things are a bit big, and provide some insulation against the cold, and manage moisture (foot sweat). Making a mold for a shell is *very expensive*. Each manufacturer uses biometric data (foot sizes) from large population samples to size their shells. Some data leads to wider shells, some narrower. Some fit feet with higher arches, some with lower. When I was in the business, Dachstein and Koflach tended to fit wide feet, while any of the Italian boots (Munari, I think...) fit narrow feet. These days, things are probably different. Also, know that the boot shell does not change for every boot size... there are normally 2 or 3 boot sizes per shell size. The shell changes dramatically at the \"jump\"... the liners will just have more or less padding. The best fit will happen when the shell all by itself fits closely, with only the smallest possible liner. The lesson here is to fit the shell first...with no liner. If your boot fitter does not fit the shell first, seek another fitter. Some liners are better than others. Some are heat moldable over time, some have variable density foam. In the end, the more performance oriented the skier, the tighter (and probably less comfortable) the fit needs to be. A common trick used by shops is to sell a boot that is too large. Nice and comfy in the store, but the skier will hate it on the hill... they try to crank all the buckles down to take up volume, and it does not work. Almost all boots I've ever fitted could use a modification. Grind the boot board down to drop it and create more space. Dremel out the toe box a bit to make room for fat toes. Cut the back down to allow better circulation for big calves. A note on cold feet. Your feet are cold because of a crappy fit, not because the \"boots are cold\". The key to warm feet is circulation, not insulation. Any pressure point on the surface blood vessels will hinder blood getting in and out of the foot. A note on putting boots on. Stand up. You don't ski sitting down, do you? Open the boot and make sure the liner and tongue are straight. Put in your foot in one smooth motion. Buckle the top buckles first (a bit) and flex the boot as much as you can. This drives the heel back into the boot. Do this a few more times, and tighten the buckles on the top. Flex forward, and do the toe buckles now. There should be minimal pressure on the toe buckles...just enough to keep the shell from flexing open. Final note, wear one pair of ski socks...preferably on the thinner side. Don't wear two pairs thinking you will be warmer...remember what I said about circulation? Feel free to comment or question. tl; dr: Ski boots are doing a much harder job than running shoes, and have to be made accordingly. Don't expect them to fit like Nikes.

{"id": "42tb8b", "input": "Why are eye colors only blue, green or brown and not other colors like purple, orange or yellow?", "output": [{"answer": "What determines your eye color is primarily influenced by the presence of melanin in the eye. To put it very simply, melanin effectively makes things darker. Although, the colors you mentioned do exist rarely. * Brown Eyes: These are the easiest, tons of melanin! The melanin darkens the eyes to a brown shade. * Green Eyes: Melanin is present but, in smaller amounts than you would see in brown eyes. One interesting thing is that melanin still creates brown pigment, there is no actual green pigment in green eyes. The reason that the eyes appear green is because of the way light scatters after being reflected by the eye. * Blue Eyes: Very little melanin (but, not necessarily none). There is still no blue pigment, appearance of blue eyes is caused by the same light scattering mentioned for green eyes. Now for the rarer colors, including the ones you mentioned! * Hazel Eyes: Hazel isn't an agreed upon color but, hazel eyes are usually between brown and green in terms of melanin production. The light scattering explains a lot about how people with hazel eyes tend to seemingly have blue or green eyes depending on lighting. * Grey Eyes: Very little melanin, like blue Eyes but, also thought to contain collagen deposits in the colored part of the eye that influences how the light is scattered. * Amber/Golden Eyes: This would be the orange/yellow eyes that you mentioned. Animals have this a lot more than we do but, it's not unknown in humans. It's caused by a pigment called 'Lipochrome', the eyes also have melanin but, not as much as someone with brown eyes would have. * Red Eyes: Severe albinism can cause you to have near zero melanin. This can result in eyes appearing to be red in the right light. This is caused by the underlying blood vessels showing through. * Violet Eyes: Violet or Purple eyes can also be caused by albinism/near zero melanin. There is a theory that a separate genetic trait called 'Alexandrias Genesis' can cause violet eyes. Elizabeth Taylor is thought to have potentially had this trait, but, others believe it may have just been a trick of the lighting. There are a tremendous amount of positive traits connected to 'Alexandrias Genesis' that make it seem like pseudoscience, it is most likely just a very mild case of albinism. **tl;dr**: Eye color is primarily determined by melanin which works on a scale of less brown - >  more brown. Extra colors are caused by light scattering combined with the brown of the melanin but, some other factors exist to produce rarer eye colors."}]}

Not because mammography is complicated - it isn't, compared to other types of diagnostic imaging - it's because the FDA takes any program where (usually) healthy people are exposed to radiation on purpose VERY seriously. And frankly, they should. There needs to be a definite trade-off between early breast cancer detection and any harm that might occur to patients, not just from radiation but from the stress of having to go through a biopsy when it turns out to be negative anyway. So let's say we were to start screening for something else. We would need to impose all the safety guidelines, regulations, and checks on that type of imaging as well. This is starting to happen for lung cancer, a few screening programs are already in place nationwide. Like for mammography, these have to be scrutinized to a ridiculous degree in order to be FDA (or state, in some cases) approved. This increases cost per scan, and also substantially increases throughput on CT machines. So to do it, you can't already be booked solid with emergency patients, inpatients and what have you. No problem, you say, let's not use radiation. Let's use MRI or ultrasound instead. Those don't emit (ionizing) radiation. MRI is most likely a straight-up no go. Depending on the equipment and the anatomy of interest, those exams might be 20-60 minutes each (mammograms and chest CTs take 5 or less). Most MRI scanners already have near-constant throughput, so adding hundreds more patients per week is not going to happen. As for ultrasound, since they can only penetrate into the body a few centimeters, it's difficult to examine large body parts with them. Plus, ultrasound is useless on air-filled structures like the lungs (air reflects ultrasound) and is problematic with water-filled structures like the bladder (which block ultrasound). So what would you screen with ultrasound, then? Pregnant mothers? Yep, we already do that. Those considerations aside, let's say we did screening anyway - a full body CT for everyone who wants one. That's a lot of radiation, for starters. Plus it'll take radiologists a long time to scrutinize hundreds of full body scans (radiologists are already accused of missing breast cancers because of the ridiculously high throughput needed when reviewing mammograms). And even if you find anything, there's a huge chance it'll just be benign. You end up worrying the patient, exposing them to a ton of radiation, and subjecting them to biopsies or even surgery for nothing. Independent CT clinics offering full body scans used to be commonplace, but aren't anymore, for precisely those reasons. The worst outcome of all would be a patient that actually had cancer, and then a scan missed it. They might develop symptoms later, and then ignore them, because the scan turned up negative, right? It's a false sense of security. Bottom line, it sounds like a good idea, but it's just not worth it. It's much better to restrict scans to people with risk factors and/or symptoms."}]}

They transmit temperature signals as well as pain signals. They submit the information of heating or cooling from external sources to your brain. You brain, therefore interprets the binding of menthol or capcasin as a cooling/heating event on your extremities or skin. The relationship to pain is not well understood, but these receptors can also transmit pain signals. It is thought that loading these receptors up with the temperature-related compounds keep them from transmitting a pain signal as they are now more actively transmitting the temperature specific signals to the brain."}]}

The same way you can have a dream where you're falling - except you're awake and imagining this scenario. So the next question I suppose is why you get this feeling when you fall for real. Presumably it has to do with the temporary weightlessness your body experiences and your genital area is sensitive. A car going fast over a hump in the road can create the same effect sometimes. Fear of heights is instinctive afaiaa - pretty much everyone has it. It's the one thing in a game or movie that actually affects me - i.e I can sit and watch horror films etc with no reaction at all - I don't get scared watching them. But if I fall in a game I sometimes experience the sensation of falling for real and the mere thought of being somewhere precarious and high up can make me shudder."}]}
{"id": "2c4zmh", "input": "Why do fight scenes in older movies look so fake compared to newer movies? Isn't it just choreography? Not CGI (mostly).", "output": [{"answer": "Hi, I do professional fight choreography. The last century has seen a lot of innovation in staged violence. Prior to the advent of film as a medium staged combat was only really used for theater, and the main type of serious violence that plays had been using for centuries was fencing. (pummeling someone would have been more slapstick, and likely would have just used an actual slapstick for the fight) This meant that the fight choreographers of the early to mid 1900's were educated in how to put together a sword fight, with any hand to hand combat as a bit of an afterthought. (there would also be firearms used, but that was more of an armorer's department, rather than a fight choreographer). In the 1900's brawling became the primary way to have physical violence outside of gunplay, as swords were no longer a modern weapon. Unfortunately we did not have the stage combat \"technology\" to choreograph these fights well. The blocking techniques used in film also did not lend themselves to good fight scenes. (the scene of shatner punching the alien: look at how close their heads are to one another, there is no room for a realistic punch) In film people's faces are generally closer than people naturally get to each other, so that they can both be in the same frame. With the advances in stage violence over the last 60ish years we now have some good western brawler choreography styles to use for knock-down drag-out fights, which also works well for simulating domestic violence, and we have a new generation of fight choreographers who can do a brawl as well as they can do a sword duel."}]}

Your job is to create a pattern inside the box (so I can't see) and my job is to guess the pattern you created. I'll start by giving you one red cube. Go on, place it inside the box in any order you want. Done? Great! I'm going to guess that your pattern is... red! Am I right? Yay! Well, that wasn't very fair, was it? Ok, I'll give you another cube. A blue one this time. Go on, place them inside your box. Ready? great! Now, let's see... is your pattern red - >  blue? No? Well, is it now blue - >  red? It is? Great! I'm GREAT at this game. What? Not fair still? Ok then, have a green cube. Ok, so I'm now guessing it could be: * Red - >  Blue - >  Green * Red - >  Green - >  Blue * Blue - >  Red - >  Green * Blue - >  Green - >  Red * Green - >  Red - >  Blue * Green - >  Blue - >  Red It is one of those? Ha! You can't beat me! What? You want ALL the cubes? But there's 9 of them! That's a lot of combinations... sit tight' this will take a while and I'm a stubborn fella. wait, what? You're only giving me 3 chances and after that I have to wait an hour before I can try again!? That's not very fair... What? you're increasing your number of cubes to 52? But that's impossible to guess in a few minutes! Are you... are you mixing stuff?! It was CUBES only! No spheres, pyramids or legos! I'm not playing this game anymore... --------- You see? I want to know your password, but you won't tell me what it is, so I have to guess. However, I have an advantage: I know, in advance, what are the elements of your password. In the above example, it's coloured cubes. I know you only have red, green and blue, so the amount of combinations is easily guessable. The more options you add, the hardest it gets to guess. This is because there are many possible combinations and orders you could use. Tech-heads call this \"high entropy\". It just means \"lots of possibilities\". In the real world, it's more complicated than that: * Passwords can have PLENTY of characters (at the very least, 52: all lowercase and uppercase letters), so from the start, you have a lot of possibilities to play with, even if your password is only 2 elements in length (still, easy to guess by a computer). * Passwords can be encrypted. This is just french for \"modified in a revertible way\". To decrypt (revert) your password, a spy would probably need to know how exactly it was encrypted in the first place, may require a key or know some secret you kept well hidden somewhere else. * Passwords don't have to be a single word or gibberish. You could use the chorus of your favourite song, a tongue twister, random words that sound funny together or some other easy thing to remember, but is really hard to guess. My main password is a 28 letter sentence to which I've added a few uppercases, some symbols and a few modifications (like writing \"bcz\" instead of \"because\"). It's pretty hard to guess. * Passwords are usually protected by a security guard. Unless stolen, this security guard will keep a strict protocol for anyone trying to guess your password: he won't let more than a few attempts, he'll stop anyone trying TOO fast, he'll let you know someone is failing too many times at guessing your password and ask you to change it, he'll become suspicious and ask the guesser some question to make sure it's a human and not a computer, etc. etc. So, by making your password long enough, you're making life so much harder to anyone trying to guess it it just becomes worthless to attempt to guess."}]}
{"id": "6g1bnx", "input": "Why is it that the constant orbit of electrons around the nucleus of an atom is not classed as an example of perpetual motion?", "output": [{"answer": "Like explained in another post already, electrons aren't \"orbiting the core\" like planets orbit the sun. As said, they would emit electromagnetic waves constantly and end up falling into the core once their energy was radiated away; if they kept moving though, they would indeed be an actual ''perpetual movement machine'' (meaning they would basically generate energy from nothing). This problem arises because in most schools, you are taught to think of electrons as an actual particle (a classical concept), when in actuality they are quantummechanical objects i.e. excitations of their respective fields (probability \"waves\"/fuctions with partly \"particle-like\" properties so to speak). We can't measure their \"velocity\" and locality at the same time (or rather, the more precise you measure one, the less precise the other measurement gets), thus we assign them probabillities. We can calculate these probabilities and we find that they have a 0% chance of being in the atom's core, everywhere else however, that probability is not 0, even though it is infinitly small, on Venus for example, it may still be there. To get around that we calculate the arrea that has a 90%-99% chance of being and call them orbitals (basically what you get taught as the different \"shells\" of an atom in school (it's somewhat more complex than that, but that's *basically* it)). These orbitals are basically the \"room\" you speak of when refering to an atom minus the room taken up by the core (less that 0.1%). As such, \"electrons\" aren't really moving, but are *dislocated* in a large cloud of their probable positions around the atom's core. You can collapse this *cloud* into a single position by measuring them, but as stated above, you are unable to attain their \"velocity\" then."}]}
{"id": "5dh34s", "input": "why is California shutting down its last nuclear power plant, I thought nuclear power was a good thing?", "output": [{"answer": "In the 40's-60's the world had a can-do attitude and as soon as they could do a thing, they did it. So, when they figured out how to make fission power plants, they made them; nevermind that they required active cooling to prevent meltdown. The time between man splitting the atom and utility scale power plants it not a long time at all. These plants maybe weren't the best designs and maybe not safe at all. Fast forward to Chernobyl and fissile energy got a big black eye and basically all development and education related to fissile energy production stopped. There was a pretty large knowledge loss as people educated and experienced in the design of nuclear power plants grew old while no new plants/people were brought in. After Chernobyl, they tried to make existing plants safer. The outcome was a lot like old airports post 9/11. A mess, but more or less secure. Unfortunately, this reputation built up by old designs for being unsafe is preventing the world from moving forward with perfectly safe newer designs. Somehow anti-nuclear has gotten momentum with environmentalists that don't seem to realize that it isn't renewables vs nuclear but coal vs nuclear. By being anti-nuclear, they are pro coal. There are currently new reactor designs that could safely burn the waste from old reactors for decades and decades and designs that could burn fresh fuel much more safely. The problem is, they can't build the new reactors because no one wants a new reactor built anywhere near them (despite coal plants releasing more radiation). Also, over the top safety regulations for older plant designs are stifling new design. Imagine if every car on the road needed a guy with a flag to walk in front of it, that was a real regulation for early cars and the same level of nonsense exists for nuclear energy."}]}

{"id": "3wyefk", "input": "How do music royalties work? Does a composer get a check every week or month for life? And typically how much for a hit song?", "output": [{"answer": "There are two components of a song that are distinct and separate and understanding how they are different is essential. 1. The composition that a song writer composes and puts down in sheet music. This is the copyright and the royalty recipient is the songwriter. He is often represented by a Publisher. 2. A recording of such a composition. This is the master and the royalty recipient is the artist. He is often represented by a Label. The terminology is important. While \"artist\" seems like a fair way to describe someone who writes songs, it will cause confusion if you try to apply it that way in this kind of discussion. So songwriter-copyright-publisher and then artist-master-label is the way it is. Both the songwriter and the artist receive royalties but they are quite different in how they are calculated and handled. Sometimes the writer and the artist are the same person, probably more often they are not, but even if they are, they will get checks from two different entities. Think about \"singer songwriter\" as a genre, it's referring to someone who does both. Let's invent a writer and an artist for these examples - Joe Melody is a gifted songwriter and composer, and Bob Crooner is a singer with a killer voice. Joe Melody is represented by a Publisher, and Bob Crooner is represented by a Label. Each of those entities is responsible for tracking the usage of their intellectual property, gathering the income and distributing it to Joe and Bob. There are so many different revenue streams it's hard to break down who gets what from where but I'll try. I guess I will go by platform, and keep it simple. There is plenty of nuance and exception that will bog us down. CD, LP, Cassette or other physical format, and also digital permanent download: Crooner records an album of 10 of Melody's songs. His label gets him in a studio and manufactures a CD and gets it on Amazon and they also get the album on iTunes. On Crooner's behalf, his Label has requested from Melody's Publisher licenses to use the written songs. To keep it brief, these licenses are free and require only that Crooner notify Melody that it is happening. This license binds Crooner to pay Melody 9.1c for every sale he makes of him singing Melody's song. This rate is set by the government and the Label is responsible for paying it to the Publisher. The Label will administer this whole deal. So a track gets sold on iTunes. iTunes receives 0.99c and the Crooner's Label a month or two later gets their 0.70c. Crooner's label then owes Melody's Publisher 9.1c. So what happens to the other 0.60c and what does Crooner get? That depends. Because at first music could not be recorded and taken away to listen to again, we have a very well developed government mandated ruleset for compositions, but not for the master recordings. They were a relatively late development, and the free market has found its own level. Basically Crooner and the Label agree on a percentage of income that allows for both to earn something. Crooner agrees to a 15% royalty. Does that seem low? It's not really. Out of the 0.60c the Label is left with it needs to do a lot of things, including recoup the costs of the studio time, artwork, manufacturing, promotion etc. and also pay their rent and staff. The bargaining power of each party will ebb and flow over time and contracts will be renegotiated every couple of years. Three to five years is a normal range for a contract. If Crooner signs for 15% of net income on a three year contract and he really takes off as a singer, when the contract expires he can ask for more or shop around if he wants. Radio Play Crooner's song comes on the radio in your car. Crooner gets nothing. Melody's and his Publisher are members of a Performance Rights Organisation which arranges paid licenses with anybody who wishes to publicly play music and distributes fees to the songwriters based on how much airplay a song gets. This PRO will pay Melody his share direct and Melody's Publisher their share direct, this is not something the Publisher manages. How much it is depends on the PRO and what kind of deal they made with whoever is playing the music. Remember how I said Crooner gets nothing? That's just the way it is in the US right now. Luckily for Crooner, terrestrial radio is becoming a smaller piece of the pie. He will get performance royalties as an artist for digital radio and digital streaming services like Sirius, Pandora or Spotify. Melody is already set up to receive his songwriter royalty. For streaming it is set at 10% of net income, not 9.1c. A lot of streaming plays, especially if they are ad-supported might bring in a fraction of a cent. I'm going to stop here to see if I am getting at the info you want. I'm happy to expand and answer other questions. I've been in the business of operating label and publisher concerns for 15 years. ETA: the royalty cycle is either quarterly or half yearly and you can expect to get paid 45-90 days after the end of a period for any income processed during said period. e.g. Jan-Jun might be a pay period, and everyone would received checks mid August or end September."}]}

When passed by a magnetic reading head, like the kind in a cassette player, the bill will create an electronic signal. Imagine this signal is a single song.

So all dollar bills play the \u201cWashington\u201d song and all fives play the \u201cLincoln\u201d. So on and so forth. The vending machine has a chip in it that has a library of all these songs. Some only have one song saved (almost always for a dollar bill). So the machine will play the song, and then try to match the song it just heard to all the songs in the library. When it finds a close enough match, it\u2019ll add the value linked to the song to the tally of money entered. Sometimes machines can only recognize the song from side a of the bill, and it\u2019ll show you that you have to insert the bill face up. Some machines know both sides.

{"id": "3nxipf", "input": "why did cars used to have their engines in the back, then with more modern cars the engine was moved to the front, then with some sports cars the engine is in the back again?", "output": [{"answer": "The main reason is that the engine is probably the heaviest part of your car. Having it up front puts that weight over the two front wheels. These are important because they steer and do most of your breaking. For that they need traction. So having a lot of your weight on top of them keeps them on the road where they do the most good. Front wheel drive cars also use this force to stick to the ground while accellerating and rear wheel drive cars use it to counter balance the torque your rear wheels create with hard acceleration. Your front end actually wants to flip up if your engine is strong enough. Another point is that front engines are easier (cheaper) to cool because you have all that air you're driving through going against the front of your car. So no pipes or protrusions on the car. Just a nice simple grill with a radiator behind it. Rear engines in older cars are made mostly to be cheaper by not having a long drive train to your rear wheels. In sports cars and racing, the engine is placed so as to best balance the car for the race it's doing. Generally if you have your weight evenly on all four tires, your car races better."}]}

A woman who's had a chance to learn, to grow up without the role of wife and mother thrown at her before she's completed secondary school is a woman who is going to fight hard for her rights. If you look at the history of feminism you'll see educated women are treated better, have more choice and fight hard for their rights. Women who are married off young don't realise they may have other choices. Access to birth control. That's another huge step in empowering women. I cannot believe that there are still so many women being denied the basic right to choose if and when they should have children. In many societies women are still considered the primary child carers (which I think is bullshit, having been raised primarily by my dad) which means that when they become pregnant, usually at a young age, their whole life is fucked before its begun. Having a child is a choice you should make mutually with your partner, not something you have no say in. Religion seriously needs to rethink its stance in women. I'm an atheist but I have no issue with people who follow a religious faith. What I do have an issue with is people using arguments and writings than are thousands of years old as a template for his women should behave in this day and age. If we had left our medical practices the same we'd all be dying like flies but the mainly male religious leaders seem perfectly happy to ask women to stay in roles that were outdated a thousand years ago. Because they benefit from it. And the biggest thing for me is the right to speak out without fear of reprisal or hostility from authority figures. If women don't have a right to voice their abuse then society is failing them. This occurs even in western 'feminist' societies. Here in the UK there was a specialist rape case unit within the main police force. They have been investigated and officers fired for, among many things, flat out lying about cases being dropped by the victim, joking privately about women 'asking for it' and in one memorable case they pinned a rape victims underwear to their notice board because they thought they were sexy. Add this to the fact that most women are raped by someone they know and you have the fear of breaking families or friendships coupled with the fear that no one will believe you and a less than willing police force and its clear to see why so many women just don't report rape. TL:DR treat us like people, educate us, stop telling us god wants us to be second class citizens, give us the right to choose our pregnancies and for fucks sake, believe us when we report it."}]}

{"id": "28y373", "input": "If a person knew no form of language, written or spoken, what would the thoughts be like in their head?", "output": [{"answer": "I am going to disagree with /u/kparseyan. Obligatory mention here that I'm working towards a doctorate in English. You have to answer a question before you can even ask about this scenario: **what is language**? Obviously, written and spoken English/French/Chinese is a language. We all get that. But that doesn't really answer the question. We might also stipulate that, with no conscious thought (that we know of) plants don't speak a language. We can nail down both ends of the spectrum, but what you do with the middle is where the fun lives. What does language do? How does language work? Without getting super technical, language is a way of putting a symbol to a concept. The oldest adage about this is the word 'tree'. I say that word, you imagine a tree, but the tree you imagine might not be the same one in my head. We're not talking about a particular tree, we're talking about the concept of a tree. 'Tree' contains nothing. It is a symbol for a set of ideas. But even that's not enough. What language really does, its real power, comes in being able to differentiate between things. It's a relationship of various concepts, a network of ideas, that we separate out in taxonomies. What makes a tree a tree is that it is not a giraffe or a rock or a flower. What something is also implies what it isn't. The human brain, almost any brain, is capable of doing this. /u/kparseyan is incorrect when he says that, without language, you can understand sensations like hunger, pain, beauty....that's not true. Even if it isn't spoken or written, the brain has made a symbol for that sensation. There's an abstraction required, not to feel hunger, but to understand that the feeling is hunger and to act accordingly. Even without language, you'd be able to feel [gnawing hunger] and, probably by instinct alone, you'd be able to connect that feeling to satiation when you eat a sandwich. That's a language that is happening without words. That interaction relays a relationship between the feeling and the solution. That [hunger] is distinct from [sleepy] and [thirsty] and thus requires a different solution. When I feel [x] I identify it as distinct. Things can only be distinct things if I can tell they are different from other things. I need to be able to tell that hunger is different from thirst is different from pain is different from sleepy. Whether you put words or colors or pictures to those different sensations, you're creating a taxonomy of 'things' or 'concepts' that you identify as individual elements. Your brain, therefore, has a language with which to process those individual feelings. Even at the most basic level, you have to make the distinction of where you begin and the world ends. Seeing yourself an an individual, understanding that you are the 'I' is an an act of language. That written/spoken stuff is just a way for us to normalize symbols in social groups. It allows us to communicate our internal monologue with others. My ability to look at a tree and know it is different than a flower or a rock is happening by vision. My ability to talk to you about that time I fell out of a tree when I was six requires a set of symbols that you share with me, so I can relay abstract concepts reliably to another person."}]}

{"id": "3moi8g", "input": "How is 'planned-obsolescence' built into Smartphones?", "output": [{"answer": "Your question implies that planned obsolescence is companies *making* things fall apart/degrade after a certain amount of time. In fact, it's companies saying *they don't care* if something degrades after a certain amount of time. In smartphones, you can see this in a couple of ways: * Integrated batteries; even if you're nice to a battery, it will eventually stop taking enough of a charge to be useful. Batteries are picked so that most of the time the battery will not fail within the planned useful life. They save money by not using batteries that last beyond that planned life. * Software updates; as the OS and its core software advance in features and capabilities, it'll be harder and harder for older devices to \"keep up\". Every time the company releases a new device, their cost to test updates on every device goes up. They make up for this by reducing and eventually eliminating testing on the oldest devices. The older the device, generally the less testing it receives. This means old devices are more likely to have problems with newer software. * Wearing components; plugs/jacks, switches, and buttons are designed to survive \"typical use\" for a certain period. Things that wear out less-easily are more expensive. The company plans for the hardware to last past the point they consider the phone obsolete, and so such things often wear out not long after the point of obsolescence. The philosophy of planned obsolescence is really all about saving costs for the company by only spending what it takes to make a product last until it's considered obsolete by the company/majority of users. You can see that different companies approach this philosophy in different ways. E.g. my 2007 iPhone has been in continuous use and hasn't broken, even though it can't run a recent OS due to not being supported; but my inexpensive emergency flip phone died after about 2 years -- it was designed to be cheap and replaceable and the manufacturer *didn't care* about the phone surviving past the typical contract period."}]}

Every time you're there, you're subjected to long lines, convoluted regulation, and bad service. Why is it like that? Because there is nothing for the DMV to compete against. The government essentially created a monopoly that everyone had to use, and flooded the system by making it so centralized, leading to the long lines and inefficiency. If you hate the DMV, but need a license, there is nowhere else to go to, so you have to deal with it. Take this system into education and you see the same things. Book shortages, crowded classes, flawed standardized testing systems, under-qualified teachers, and substandard conditions. Take this system into healthcare and you see hospitals being overcrowded, leading to people waiting longer for vital services or having to resort to lower quality healthcare since there are not enough good doctors to go around, so the government will probably be hiring bad ones just like they hire bad teachers. The problem here is that you're paying so much through taxation for what is basically a shoddy product that could be produced better and cheaper if it were left up to a competitive market. Healthcare is already fully regulated even before obamacare, and all of it has been made unaffordable by the government. The one area where the government doesn't touch, the optometrist area, is the only area the average person can afford because it's legal for private doctors to bid prices down. If you're a public sector doctor, you have to serve these people at these prices, which makes it less desirable to be a doctor. A little known fact is that the most regulated businesses are healthcare and education, and they are completely unaffordable. The least regulated industry:technology. Computers are arguably just as complex of a field as biology, but one is affordable to the average person and one isn't. It has nothing to do with the complexity of the product, but how it's being economically handled.

For example, Mercedes-Benz chose to offer only the lower-output 380SEL model in 1981 to Americans, some of whom wanted the much faster 500SEL available in the rest of the world. BMW had the same issue with their 745i Turbo. The grey market was successful enough that it ate significantly into the business of Mercedes-Benz of North America and their dealers. The corporation launched a successful million-dollar congressional lobbying effort to stop private importation of vehicles not officially intended for the U.S. market.\" [Source]( URL_0 ) That lobbying led to making a bunch of arbitrary and bullshit laws, like needing US crash testing, US emissions, and US market glass, and only cars that are over the age of 25 are exempt.

The car market in Europe is 10x better and far cheaper if you buy used. New cars are more expensive as a result of certain trade agreements and high taxes.

Because you're filthy. JK lol. It is not coincidental that these people you've seen are all Asian. It's quite common in East Asia for people to wear facial masks when out and about. It's mostly out of health concerns. For instance, in some places (e.g., China) people are very aware that the air quality is horrendous, so they wear masks as an inexpensive way to protect their lungs. Similarly, people are very sensitive to airborne germs in places like subways or buses where many people are crammed into a confined space. So many people in such situations wear masks to prevent themselves from getting sick or, if they're sick themselves, avoid spreading germs to others. Casually wearing facial masks in Asia is sort of the Asian equivalent of hand-washing in the West. Where westerners are much more cognizant of hand sanitation than dirty air, East Asians are much more cognizant of airborne pathogens and pollutants than dirty hands. So westerners wash their hands but never wear masks, while Asians wear masks but don't wash their hands (as often). *[And before anybody takes issue with that last point, I dare you to visit a public restroom in any East Asian country other than Japan - there is rarely ever hand soap, and when there is,  < 50% of people actually use it.]* Of course, everything I just said is an enormous generalization and there are obviously plenty of exceptions at the individual level.

For example the moon orbits the earth, but also the earth orbits the moon, its just that the moon is much smaller so its a much smaller orbit. You can see a drawing i just randomly pulled off a google search here:  URL_0  . The barycenter, the center of mass, between the moon and the earth lies inside the surface of the earth, but not at earth's center. So there's actually a wobble going on as the earth orbits the moon. This is also true of everything else, because the distances are very large and the masses are pretty large, its generally enough to talk about an object being close enough to dominate, the one object, the planet, the star, that's close enough to make all the other gravitational pulls look insignificant. Though really the moon is actually not so much dominated by the earth, its orbit around the sun is always concave, basically the moon is always falling toward the sun the earth just sort of slows it at places, never bends it away like a bigger planet might do with their moons. Anyway, basically gravity goes from anything to any other thing, the center of mass of our solar system drifts around as the planets, especially the giant ones like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune move around. Sometimes its inside the sun, and sometimes its outside the sun, the sun itself can orbit that. In a broader sense, the Milky Way galaxy that we're in has a bunch of other mass distributed throughout it, and may have a giant black hole at its center. The sun can feel that pull and orbit the center of mass there. And the Galaxy can feel all the other mass in the universe transmitting gravitational force at the speed of light across vast distances, the sum of immense amounts of mass generating force that dissipates over vast distances. Essentially an orbit is just a way of talking about the motion under gravity when there's a big heavy thing close enough by to make all the other big heavy things far away seem insignificant. In reality, everything is orbiting everything else all the time. Everything is falling towards everything in the most efficient way it can."}]}
{"id": "5sgfzh", "input": "Parallel was faster than serial, why isn't there an UPB - \"Universal Parallel Bus\"?", "output": [{"answer": "To summarise others' contributions here and add a couple of minor points: Problems with parallel: 1. Synchronisation of data across multiple parallel lines at very high data rates is very difficult due to variable propagation speeds of those lines (due to variations in capacitance, inductance and resistance of those lines) 2. Increased cost due to increased complexity of the transmit-receive electronics and mechanical connectors and wiring. 3. Increased size of the connectors and cable, which is at odds with increased miniaturisation and available space on the connected devices. 4. Potentially increased noise due to cross-talk between the data lines, which can only be reduced by increasing (3) and hence (2). 5. Not all data transfers need to be at the maximum bandwidths possible with either serial or parallel connections, since both the data source and destination are likely to have other internal systems that have more limited bandwidth, such as a mechanical hard drive. So, why not stick with the smaller, cheaper serial solution? Back in my day as an electronic engineer, when RS-232 was standard, few could possibly have imagined the data rates that are achievable in serial connections today.

{"id": "7fo79c", "input": "Can You Protect Electronics From EMPs/solar flares? If So How?", "output": [{"answer": " >  I'll start with the grounding question, because that's the easiest to answer: Doesn't help a bit. All that matters is that the metal container is conductive and doesn't have gaps (ammo cans are bad at isolating from UHF on up because that rubber gasket only leaves the lid connected to the body at the ends, and that allows radiation in if the wavelength is short enough). If you're concerned about direct lightning hits, then having the can connected to ground could attract lightning to it, especially if it's much above ground level. I'd leave it ungrounded.  > The paint can sounds like a great solution for anything small enough to fit inside. Since it's designed to make an airtight seal, you know you have metal-to-metal contact all the way around the edge of the lid. Trash cans aren't very good on that point -- the lid probably only touches the can at a few points, leaving long (also thin, but it's the long part that matters) gaps, so RF can get inside. They, like the ammo cans, will still protect well from low frequencies (such as indirect lightning effects). Insulation on the inside isn't really necessary (the whole point of the Faraday cage is that currents only flow on the outside surface), but I suppose it can't hurt.  >  Radios are a fine way to test isolation. It's better if you can control the signal strengths involved and have some basis for comparisons, so you can get an idea of how much attenuation the can provides. The point about testing at high frequencies is valid -- in all but a very very few cases, low frequencies will always be better-isolated than high frequencies. The microwave, I think, is one of those few counterexamples -- it's a resonant cavity tuned to one specific frequency (2.45 GHz), and the edges of the door are positioned at natural zero-current areas for that frequency. At any other frequency, the fact that the door isn't electrically connected to the body around most of the edge allows some RF through.  > As for what frequencies matter for what sort of threats, it's time for numbers. Starting with the lowest, and therefore easiest for a Faraday cage to handle: * Solar flares and resulting geomagnetic storms: Hundredths of a Hz. Complete non-issue for anyone but the guys running the power grid and pipelines. Small risk of surges on the power lines themselves from transformer failures, but absolutely no RF risk (i.e. if it's not plugged in, it doesn't give a damn). * Lightning: Mostly below 1 MHz. That means wavelengths of hundreds of meters, so anything that more or less surrounds your electronics will protect from the electromagnetic waves (i.e. the indirect effects that extend hundreds of meters from the strike). Direct hits from the strike itself are nearly impossible to protect against, since a lightning strike can easily blow a hole through something like an ammo can. But those follow conductors, so don't store your Faraday-protected electronics next to that wire running to the old TV antenna on your chimney. For testing in this frequency range, try an AM radio tuned to the strongest station you can find. * Nuclear EMP: Worst below 100 MHz, but significant up to several hundred MHz. Wavelengths as short as several inches. This is where things become demanding. Gaps of several inches in length may allow RF to penetrate into a Faraday cage. Making sure the lid contacts the body around its whole circumference, or at least every inch or two, is important. To test isolation for this sort of thing, try at least UHF (FRS/GMRS radios operate around 460-470 MHz, which is a good example). * Non-nuclear EMP bomb: Up to several GHz, perhaps tens of GHz. Wavelengths down below an inch. Damn hard to shield against, but short-ranged and, in my opinion, not likely to be seen unless you're on the wrong end of a serious attack from a high-tech power. If you're still concerned about it, then look to absolutely, completely seal your Faraday cage. Consider soldering the lid on to that paint can. Testing at cellphone/wifi frequencies would be a start, but threats could go well beyond that frequency range. There just isn't much consumer hardware that uses frequencies this high. First off: The after-effects of solar flares abso-farking-lutely cannot damage anything that isn't connected to miles of metal. If it isn't plugged into the grid, and isn't a miles-long pipeline, and isn't outside the Earth's atmosphere, it doesn't freaking care. While removing batteries won't do much, removing antennas from radios is an excellent first step (having something that's designed to collect RF energy attached to your electronics is obviously a bad idea). Also, power lines can act as pretty effective antennas, particularly for VHF and lower frequencies, so removing that connection is also a beginning step. It's all a matter of degrees of protection, and something is better than nothing. I don't know exactly where you got [the idea that lead is the best EMP shielding], but I'm guessing you have nuclear EMPs confused with nuclear (i.e. ionizing, mainly gamma) radiation. They are very, very different things. Lead is popular for shielding from x-ray and gamma radiation because it's cheap and extremely dense, but there's nothing else particularly special about it. Its relatively low conductivity gives it a larger skin depth than other metals, which doesn't help for electromagnetic shielding. There are several things wrong with [the listed requirements of quarter-inch-thick-steel]. It sounds like you're talking about a low-altitude or surface nuclear burst. Those don't produce any significant EMP except deep within the kiss-your-ass-goodbye zone. Unless you're inside a hardened blast shelter, you'll be rather too smashed, scorched, and irradiated to notice that your radio isn't working. Widespread nuclear EMPs come from bursts extremely high in the atmosphere -- we're talking low-Earth-orbit altitudes here, hundreds of miles up. The effects are continent-wide, and they don't weaken very much with distance until you pass the burst's horizon. Non-nuclear EMP sources (lightning and conventional, engineered EMP bombs) are short-ranged, but generally on the scale of hundreds of feet to hundreds of yards, not several miles, so your guidelines don't really apply to those either. As for the shielding recommendations, those again sound like you're talking about gamma radiation. A quarter inch of anything is total overkill for RF shielding except at very low frequencies (tens of kHz, maybe?). Such low frequencies don't couple to small circuitry, so there's no reason to worry about them. In response to insistence that all shielding/cages must be grounded: The bit about grounding is simply wrong. Gauss's law does not care if your shielding is grounded, only that it forms a continuous, closed surface. If you don't know what Gauss's law is, or why it applies here, stop giving advice right now because you do not have the background to understand what you're talking about. I mostly agree about digital stuff being more vulnerable than analog. However, once again, lead is not special. Electromagnetic shielding is not a matter of absorbing energy, but reflecting it. Lead isn't uniquely good at either of those. You want conductivity and lots of it, but that's pretty easy to get from common sheet metals. The tough part is making sure that you don't have gaps with poor or nonexistent connections (like around the lid of a container, or at the door of a safe), so if you're choosing a metal you should go for something that makes good, reliable electrical contacts. Also, I'm pretty sure fire-resistant safes don't use lead in their construction. My personal contribution to the thread: HERO. Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordinance. HERO is defined as the threat to electrically and non-electrically fire ordinance and equipment from electromagnetic radiation. It's also one of the first things I learned about before the .mil let me within pissing distance of a blasting cap. Thing is, the military's been thinking about this EMP hoo-yah for quite sometime, and they are worried about both pulses, pulse weapons, and rapid accumulation, which has a tendency to fire ungrounded ordinance. So, to prevent electrically fire rockets and sensitive electronics from malfunctioning or \"cooking off\" due to HERO and EMP (which presents a HERO threat) the solution is simple. Mylar baggies, about .7mil thick, and sealed on all four sides. No grounding, no lead, nothing else. Mylar baggies. Shit works too. Next time you order a small electronic component from some internet company, look at the little baggie it comes in. Sealed mylar. That protected that chip from air travel at 35,000 feet, land travel through rural, urban, and suburban areas, and all the electromagnetic radiation that the trip entails. No ground wires. No lead shielding. No safes. Just what I've learned both from electronic warfare specialists, and from my own training in How Not To Get Myself Blown Up Or Fry The Radios. Source:  URL_0 "}]}

I believe what you're thinking of as \"old lady perfume smell\" is from aldehydes, which is a category of compounds that are present in a wide range of perfumes. The perfume that popularized aldehydes (though not the first to use them) was the classic Chanel No. 5, released in the early 1920's. At the time, I believe it felt distinctly modern and avant garde to feature a synthetic smell as a prominent note in a lady's perfume, instead of traditionally feminine florals; I'm sure you can imagine how that turned things on their head! This character of perfume was duplicated and riffed on through the 50s and 60s. But of course, as with so many fashions, the effect is now dated. Combine the outdated trend with the fact that most of the people still wearing it are probably using very old bottles of the stuff (and perfume does change in character as it ages, never in a good way), you get \"old lady smell.\" Fashion is cyclical, though, so don't be surprised if aldehyde-based perfumes start to get popular again, though I predict they will be far more subtle and nuanced this time around."}]}
{"id": "1qkwsq", "input": "Why are people so paranoid about government surveillance or surveillance in general?", "output": [{"answer": "Someone else actually explained this exact thing to me, so I'll relay what I remember to you. Pretend we've got a huge school (talking thousands of children), and the principle wants to stay up to date on their very activities. After all, it'd be very bad if there was a little incident in a school this size as it can easily balloon over, plus there are idiots from other schools whom know kids from your school and come by to mess things up. So you ask a very smart, honest, and secretive kid to ask about three or four of his friends to keep their ears open, and to relay results to you. At first, this plan is perfect, after all nothing bad could possible happen. I mean, he did choose great kids. However, these kids in turn gave their responsibility to their friends and that's where the buck stopped. However, we've gone from a brilliant kid, to just some people helping their lazy friend. This is maybe about 1% of the school population whom know what the principle wanted done. So the smart kid from earlier and his select three or four are trust worthy. After all, they wouldn't abuse the information they found out just to get back at someone. However, what about the couple of other kids whom have never even come face to face with you? So now back to your question, the principle is the US government, the smart kid is the head of NSA with the people he chose personally the upper executives. The people they in turn chose are just the normal workers whom listen to all interactions done by people. Now the problem with why people don't want the NSA listening on to them is because the people at the bottom level haven't done anything to prove that they have robot like mind-sets. After all, they are human and and could very well succumb to their human emotions and reveal something important or embarrassing to get revenge on someone who may or may not have wronged them. For example, would you want your mother, grandmother, teachers, boss, coworkers, and the nice old lady at the supermarket knowing about your giant amputee porn collection? As well, this much information given to so many people could very well fall in the wrong hands (leading up to what I just said). And that my 5 year old class, is why we don't want the NSA listening to us."}]}
{"id": "1mpljf", "input": "how does hypnosis work? Does a person who is easily hypnotized not have as much of a powerful brain as someone who isn't able to be hypnotized as easy or at all?", "output": [{"answer": "Your susceptibility to hypnosis depends on your ability to bypass your \"critical factor,\" not on your intelligence. So what is the critical factor? Every day, you have random thoughts, such as \"I really hope I don't spill this cup of apple juice all over myself.\" Or \"I should go study now.\" Whether your subconscious mind automatically carries out these instructions depends on your critical factor. When you are child, you have not yet developed the critical factor. That's why if you tell a small child: \"don't drop that,\" they will invariably drop whatever they are holding (since the subconscious mind can't understand \"don't\" - e.g. if you read \"don't picture a pink elephant,\" you tend to automatically picture a pink elephant). It's because they have no critical factor. The instructions you give them go directly to their subconscious mind, and and their body implements them. As you grow older, you recognize that you can't simply blindly follow every external instruction that you receive. However, you still need the ability to communicate with your subconscious. How else do you instruct your body to do things, like eat, drink, walk over to the bed, etc? Your critical factor parses which instructions you want to follow and which you do not. A hypnosis \"induction,\" which is said before any instructions are attempted, is supposed to induce the subject into a relaxed state and to distract the conscious mind so that the critical factor will be lessened (for the later instructions to come). For 99% of the population, hypnosis places them in a relaxed state where their critical factor is not as strong. These people are more likely to follow suggestions. But for those 99%, when they are hypnotized, they still feel in complete control. If they are hypnotized by a stage hypnotist, for example, to squack like a chicken, they will report that they were aware of what was happening the whole time. They complied because they thought it would be funny and didn't see any harm in it. The hypnosis induction made them relaxed and lessened their critical factor, so they were less worried in this state about embarrassment or the social implications of doing something stupid. The fact that everyone expected them to comply also lessened the social embarrassment from doing something stupid and in fact placed peer pressure to comply. So most people under hypnosis are still in complete control of themselves. They are simply in a state of heightened suggestiveness. However, one could choose not to be hypnotized. The induction won't do anything to you if you think hypnosis is stupid or won't work (this is your critical factor telling you not to pay any attention to the hypnosis). I have personally been under hypnosis and gotten an important phone call and decided to break out of the trance state and go back to my \"normal\" state so I could answer the phone. There is no such thing for most people that if they are not broken out of trance, they will continue to walk around like zombies. For most people, also, unless they are completely skeptical of hypnosis, the longer you spend on the induction (relaxing their critical factor), the more susceptible they will later be to suggestions. So for 99% of the population, hypnosis is not strong enough to alter your perception of reality or force you to do anything you would not otherwise. However, approximately 1% of the population are extremely susceptible to hypnosis. They can be hypnotized to *completely eliminate* their critical factor. They will accept all suggestions with critically evaluating them, just as a small child might. The hypnotist is giving commands directly to their subconscious, with no interruption for their conscious mind. These can be hypnotized not to feel pain. They can be age regressed so they can perfectly describe a memory from when they were 2 years old and can be led to believe they are actually still 2 years old. They can be hypnotized to forget whatever they have done while under hypnosis. There are various measures of susceptibility to hypnosis, such as the Harvard Group Scale (HGSS). Hypnosis works better to treat some types of disorders because they tend to be more susceptible. For example, people with multiple dissociative personality disorders tend to be VERY susceptible to hypnosis and can be hypnotized to switch between various personalities to allow the therapist to talk to a certain personality. Here are some examples of what can be done to this hyper-sensitive 1% with hypnosis. They can be convinced to throw what they believe to be acid in someone's face:  URL_2  They can be hypnotized not to feel extreme cold (to the point where they could die of hypothermia without ever feeling cold):  URL_0  They can be instructed to forget what has happened (Derren has already hypnotized this subject at this point in the video not to remember anything he does when he sees polka dots):  URL_3  Disclaimer - Derren is an entertainer, but what he does in selecting a subject (narrow down to only the most susceptible person he could find) is done by many other researchers who have tested hypnosis theories. You can also see Derren himself being *shocked* at certain points in the video that his subject really doesn't seem to remember anything. Derren himself is amazed at how far he can go with hypnosis with someone who is so hyper-sensitive to it, which leads to the conclusion that these videos are not merely staged for entertainment purposes. Derren even makes the subject take a polygraph to see if he is lying about being that deep in trance:  URL_1 "}]}

Anyone about please correct my if I err. In Gaelic, the vowels a, o and u are \"broad\", and so broaden consonants near them, whilst e and i are 'slender' and so 'slenderise' consonants near them. The Slender form of 's' is pronounced like \"sh\". Also, h is used to asperate the consonants: b, c, m, p, d, g, t, and s. (The lenited 'sh' is also pronounced like the english, so when leniting 'Se' to 'She' we have a slenderised lenited 's' - pronounced \"h\"). A better example of this effect is in Seamus. Seamus is pronounced with a slender \"sh\" sound at the beginning and a broad 's' sound at the end. If we are to put the name in the vocative case we have to to two things, first we lenite, so 'Se' - >  'She', pronounced \"h\", secondly, we have to slenderise the end of the word, so '-as' (pronounced \"sh\") - >  '-ais', pronounced \"sh\".

I would wholly appreciate if anyone can convince me to change my mind on any of this. To start off, reality is a pervasive thing. Especially the reality of the past. Every time you remember a memory, that memory has the potential to be altered. There was a woman who had fully convinced herself she was present at the twin towers on 9/11, when she wasn't actually there at all. Regression hypnosis therapy was an extremely popular thing for a while, until we started to realize how fragile memory was. Lots of people wound up in jail, because therapists trying to 'unlock' repressed memories of abuse in their patients would actually *create* those memories. Patients who were not actually abused would come out of regression hypnosis therapy with vivid memories of ha inn been abused as children. Really, people's minds are open books, ready to believe whatever they're told. So, now that I've hopefully explained *how* people can just believe whatever, let me try and answer the *why*. I'll start with the religion one, since that's surprisingly the less controversial answer. Simply put, telling myths full of miracles provides the people telling them with power over the people believing them. If you say \"I want you to give me 10% of your money every week\", no one will do it. But, if you say \"God created man, man sinned, and was condemned to hell. But God was loving enough to send his son Jesus to earth to perform miracles to prove he was God's son, and then die for our sins on the cross, so that as long as people know about him they won't go to hell. Believe in him, and you won't go to hell. Also, btw, if you care about everyone, please give me 10% of your money every week so that I can keep telling people about Jesus so they won't go to hell.\" Well, now you're getting somewhere. So, people believe it because they're gullible, and they're told it because someone else benefited from telling them that lie. Now down to the meaty part of your question -- Why *do* people believe in things like moon landing and holocaust denialism? At this point, we start to enter territory where truth is like a treacherous swamp, full of sinkholes and crocodiles. There will be all kinds of differing opinions because this is an area where truth has been so skewed that people for the most part just don't know what to believe. Regardless, it's a real that I'm fascinated with, and so I'm pretty sure what I'm about to say is the truth. Repeat after me these two words. *Conspiracy Theory*. Don't they make you feel kind of dirty? Why is that? A conspiracy is just a plot by a group of people to accomplish a goal. If you think about it, it's actually absurd to suggest that powerful people *don't* conspire to get things done. In a world ruled by money, it doesn't matter how you got that money. If you look around you, I'm sure you'll see that the noblest people are often the poorest. That's because they don't think it's worth violating the law or lying to people to make money. Any 'legitimate' business that makes a sufficient amount of money is pushed flush up against the line of legality and is usually well past the line of morality. Beyond that line of legality is a whole world of illegal business. Money is money. 'Legitimate' business do deals with criminals, such as banks laundering money for drug cartels. Look at the Iran-Contra scandal, for example. That was *our own government* buying and selling *illegal drugs* in order to fund the contras and provide weapons to Iran. The whole reason they're doing this is to manipulate the working parts of our society to create advantages for American businesses to prosper. That's why countless democratic governments have been overthrown by CIA coups throughout the years. That's why JFK was assassinated, and why the twin towers fell. 'Okay -- hold up. You can't prove those last two edgarallenbro. Those are just *conspiracy theories*.' Well, that's true. When conspiracies are proven, we no longer call them conspiracies. We refer to them as 'scandals' or the like. The fact of the matter is that the CIA tried VERY hard to cover up the Iran-Contra scandal, and nearly succeeded. The journalist who first sought to expose it is dead, allegedly from suicide, although it is likely that he was killed, and it was made to look like suicide. Things like the JFK assassination and 9/11 have so far been covered up with much more ferocity, due to the implications of people knowing the truth. So what does any of this have to do with the moon landing or holocaust denial? Those things are one of the many ways in which institutions like the CIA have sought to cover up their clandestine actions by manipulating public opinion. By introducing clearly ludicrous theories like holocaust denial, moon landing denial, hollow earth theory, reptile people, etc. etc. etc., they have been able to delegitimize serious theories. A lot of the 'people' you see believing these theories *do not actually believe them*. Many of them don't even actually *exist!* There are identities that are *proponents* of these theories that have been revealed to be government operatives. They are straw men, meant to convince *just enough* gullible people to go along with them so that *you*, the average person, are convinced that 'people will believe anything'. This is so that you can turn around and say \"Well, I know there are people who believe JFK wasn't assassinated at the hands of a lone gunmen, but there are also people who believe that the holocaust was a a hoax. They're all just crazy conspiracy theories.\" and the people who are willing to do unbelievable things to seize and maintain power can continue to get away with it."}]}

The reason we're so keep to keep it lifeless is because we're trying to figure out if there is life there already or if there ever was. Once humans show up and our little biome gets out of the domes then we're going to have a really hard time figuring out what might be Martian and what's Terran. Now here's something that'll keep you up at night. If Mars DOES have life or ever had life then that means that, statistically, the whole universe should be crawling with life. I mean, to have two planets (and lets not forget Europa) that have life would mean that it's pretty common. Now why haven't we heard from any of our neighbors yet? Check out the Fermi Paradox sometime. Suffice to say, I really really hope we don't find life anytime soon. The implications are terrifying."}]}
{"id": "3tx8tl", "input": "Why can't batteries be recharged infinite times?", "output": [{"answer": "In the case of lead-acid, the \"plate\" is a thin leaf of Pb (negative) and PbO2 (positive) and the reaction absorbs the sulfide ion from the sulfuric acid electrolyte to convert both plates to lead(II) sulfate (PbSO4). It's reversible, of course... but it's like this. If you had an iron plate and it scales apart into rust, and electrolytically turned the rust back into iron, it's not a plate anymore, is it? Lead plates can be cycled about 300 times total. The material swells and contracts during discharge/recharge and slowly falls apart. It flakes off bits of lead, it cracks which disconnects a part of the plate from the terminal. There is a porous separator (a plastic or rubber mesh) between the positive and negative plates to allow them to be sandwiched very close to keep the resistance down, while separating them to prevent a short. Flakes shedding off pack into the separator and can poke through, resulting in a short. You might envision it as \"plating\" a new lead surface when it's recharged. That's not it- *the lead never moves in either plate*. The sulfide ion moves in and out of the electrolyte. The plate must be thin and porous on a molecular level (because each lead molecute can only react with electrolyte it's in contact with, otherwise the lead is useless). You might think \"well we could glue the lead to fiberglass cloth to hold it together\" but the lead will still flake and crack apart and come off at about the same point. You might say \"well let's make the lead plate like 1/4\" thick\" but then the battery would only have like 5% of the capacity it should for its size- and the shedding flakes off the plate surface will STILL clog the separator. People often ask \"well can't I just wash out the old electrolyte with new and fix the battery\"? Well, each cell is like 200 plates of interleaved positive/separator/neg plates with flaked bits of plate packed into the separator. The flaked stuff is insoluble and can't be washed out. Replacing the electrolyte fixes nothing. It can only be truly reformed by melting it back down and rolling it down into a new sheet during remfg. In the case of NiCd/NiMH/NiFe Edison cells (rare, used early 20th cent), it's different- the plates don't really break down. Rather, every time we charge them, the electrolyte loses a bit of water. In the typical sealed \"AA\" steel-can battery, there's no surplus electrolyte, and no way to refill them. But there ARE very uncommon flooded-plate NiCd/NiMH/NiFe batteries which you can add distilled water to. I have a lot of vintage flooded-plate NiCd that work fine that I sell on eBay. These DO last basically forever. It's crazy how long they last. But they do require maintenance and their charging cycle management is a bit crazy. The NiCd/NiMH/NiFe has one other enemy- carbonation. Regardless of whether they're the sealed type or not. The electrolyte is a strong base (not acid) of potassium hydroxide. If exposed to air, it absorbs carbon from the small trace of CO2 in the air and forms potassium carbonate, which is chemically useless and charging doesn't reverse that back into hydroxide. However... you CAN simply drain the electrolyte and mix up new KOH and refurbish the cell like-new again."}]}

{"id": "412zym", "input": "Why do Aboriginal Australians have it worse of than other natives people in developed countries?", "output": [{"answer": "there's several things and it goes both ways. One is the Indigenous communities lack of education. The Australian Government WANTS indigenous Australians to go to University, get well paying jobs, good educations and improve their conditions but many Indigenous people don't take these offers, instead preferring to live off Centrelink. Secondly, welfare is an issue. The government provides more generous welfare towards Indigenous communities which is fine, many communities are in the middle of the barren Outback and require additional assistance but there are also a significant number of Indigenous Australians who take advantage of welfare which can be seen in some of the poorer suburbs of the main cities (Melbourne, Sydney etc.) where I can see this myself, many Aboriginal people abuse substances and just bum around not doing much. Third, there was an insane amount of mistreatment given to Indigenous Australians behest of the Australian Government many decades ago (Aboriginal Australians were considered \"native fauna\" until the 1960s) which adds to tension between the Government and the Indigenous communities and also kind of puts many Indigenous Australians in a repeating circle of low-income, laziness, vagrancy etc. Fourthly, Indigenous Australians do receive a lot of shit from almost everyone here (although I notice it more in non-Anglo Australians) that they're shit-kicker junkies who drink goon (cheap bagged alcohol), smash darts (smoke cigarettes), hit the sniff (sniff petrol) and steal your shit. The problem is, this isn't actually a stereotype, a lot of Indigenous Australians (\"Abos\" or \"coons\" from the racist fuckwits) live like this which leads to high suicide rates and lots of substance abuse. This all falls into that whole repeating circle of Indigenous life that I mentioned. In America, you really wont hear white people, Hispanic people or anything refer to African Americans as \"Niggers\" to their face, nor will you hear it out loud, Indigenous Australians can and almost always do get insulted non-stop just for walking past someone, it's actually fucking insane how much shit they get. People will move away from an Indigenous person and if they try to talk to someone, they'll get called a dirty abbo and told to fuck off. Really, there's motivation behest of the Government to get the Indigenous communities off the ground and get Indigenous Australians into well paying jobs and a successful life but they staunchly refuse to help themselves and they also get an un-godly amount of shit from almost everyone. They pretty much get decent money from the government and don't have to do shit for it, it's not too hard for them to get so they usually just end up going to that. I'm afraid I might come off as a racist or someone who hates Indigenous people but that's not the case, I grew up with a lot of Indigenous people and I used to have a family sleep in my father's truck because the father of their family would kick them out of the house. He eventually sold their mattresses for drug money then they moved in with us, that's the kind of life many Indigenous children go through (in regards to substance abuse) and am actually half Aboriginal myself (one of my parents were Stolen Generation)."}]}

Retreading is a system by which a used tire has new tread applied to it at a tire plant, thereby making it a \"refurbished\" tire. Retread tires are used on every position on a truck except the steer axle, only new tires go on steer axle (this is the very front two tires on a truck, if they are not new then they are against DOT regulation). Is it safe? By and large, yes, we have never had a major failure across the board in a retread campaign. Do I recommend driving next to a truck or a trailer on the highway? Absolutely not. It isn't even so much because of the tires but because of the driver, sitting on the side of one they usually won't see you, if there is a blowout the tread may hit your car and damage it severely (we have large steel belts, sort of like in your car, but unfurled they would be about the size of your car). Another thing is that if a retread blows then it could blow out other tires, the truck could swerve and destroy your car. If you are on city streets being next to a truck is a lot like being next to a car so I wouldn't worry there but on highways I would suggest sticking as far as you can away from a tractor, especially one that has a trailer attached because trailer tire retreads tend to be several times retreaded tractor tires. tl;dr tractors have copies of copies of copies of tires and therefore trend toward the weaker side.

After the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, she stopped giving out marriage licenses to any couple. Davis based her actions on the idea that same-sex marriage conflicts with her Christian beliefs, so she refuses to be involved with a marriage between people of the same sex. Davis took the matter to court, arguing that her religious views should excuse her from the aspects of her job that she considers immoral. The court did not accept her position, so she appealed, and again the courts said she could not stop issuing marriage licenses. While this was going on, Davis was granted a \"stay,\" which basically said she could keep denying marriage licenses while the matter was in court. The stay just expired and the Supreme Court rejected an extension to the stay. As a result, it's pretty clear that Davis will not be able to get legal permission to continue avoiding issuing marriage licenses. In spite of the courts telling her she needs to issue the licenses, Davis still refuses to do so. By continuing to do this, she risks being fined or jailed at a later point in time. However, because County Clerk is an elected position, she cannot be fired. It is possible that she could impeached by the legislature, but that would not be a simple procedure. TL;DR: County Clerk refuses to give out marriage licenses, citing religious objections to same-sex marriage. Issue goes to court and all rulings go against her. Clerk continues to refuse to give out marriage licenses, but she can't just be fired or anything straightforward like that."}]}
{"id": "344kc6", "input": "There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly?", "output": [{"answer": "Note: I wanted to give a logical, legible, and casual examination of the question. As a result, it's pretty dull - but maybe helpful? This question makes me think of the major traits I personally associate with dragons: they're reptilian and they breath fire. Lots of creatures - mythological or plainly observable fly, so I don't think that's critical to the 'idea' of a dragon. Also to be fair, not all 'dragons' are supposed to breath fire - and I'm sure there are plenty of other fire-breathers within various mythologies. I think with the first thing, a mythological creature being described as reptilian in it's physical characteristics is a perfectly natural consequence of people being exposed to snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, ect. It would be quite strange for a culture to ignore an entire class of animals. It may be the case that there are cultures that depicted 'dragons' that were entirely unaware/unexposed to reptiles of any sort, but were these people also perfectly isolated from people who did? I don't think it is much of a stretch at all, from that point, to expect that a good number of isolated cultures could have conceived of an original version of a reptilian animal inspired by the observance of real, living reptiles. This character, through stories and artwork, would naturally be adopted by other other cultures as people interact with each other and share their ideas. Just as with music, religion, or what have you. So the idea of a dragon becomes attached to other ideas, which become a part of people's collective imaginations, and consequently become a part of those people's cultures. As for the fire-breathing part of the mystery, I think I have a good comparison. The thing that's strange about 'fire-breathing dragons' existing in multiple cultures is that there is no evidence (to my knowledge) of any observable animal being able to expel a stream of fire from it's mouth/nostrils/whatever. I think that's the gist of what we understand from depictions of such dragons. Here's my comparison: zombies eating brains. Zombies are another 'character' that can be observed in many cultures. If we decide that the most basic quality of a 'zombie' is that it is a person that has died who has come back to life, I think most people would agree that it is unsurprising that such an idea could be imagined naturally by many isolated groups of people observing death. Just as it's unsurprising that people familiar with snakes would imagine a special kind of snake. The thing that doesn't follow naturally of observing the real world is the 'brain-eating' part. As with 'brain-eating zombies', the idea of 'fire-breathing dragons' is too specifically fantastic for us to believe that several distinct cultures could have conceived of it naturally. I don't think it's reasonable to conclude from this that 'brain-eating zombies' did in fact exist in a physical capacity. My reasoning in this case is: those ideas are too specific to have originated in isolated cultures in every single individual case. Dragons only properly become 'fire-breathing dragons' once that idea becomes a part of stories and artwork. The stories only have to become popular for them to influence a people's culture. People that are a part of a culture where this popular fiction has not been accepted may very well imagine a fantastic creature that is similar only in being reptilian in nature. TL;DR People who saw reptiles were bound to imagine fantastic exaggerations, which all can be recognized as 'dragons'. Beyond their reptile-inspired characteristics, their similarities could largely be a case of specific incarnations (flying, fire breathing, poisonous, aquatic) becoming especially popular, and thus more likely to spread between cultures."}]}

The Nazis were far right and the Soviets were far left. Due to the nature of the political spectrum the two extreme points actually did have some things in common. Many of the things they had did have in common were however less outgrowth of their respective ideologies but rather a result of them both being undemocratic and not tolerating dissent as well as accumulating as much power as possibly at the top and removing possible competitors. Nazism was all about race and with some great mythology build around the concept how the Aryan race was destined to throw of the shackles of the lesser race and eventually rule. Communism had a completely different ideology that was less centered around race and more around the fact that their political ideology was destined to eventually overcome all others.

{"id": "3giduh", "input": "How is pure mathematics researched?", "output": [{"answer": "Pure mathematician here. Just to add to the comments below (or, will be below once you upvote this comment - zing!): Pure mathematics, as a discipline, originates from the process of successively abstracting the ideas of concrete math. In other words, it looks for the essential structural features that make concrete math \"work,\" without the nonessential, context clues that make it concrete. Think of it like building a taxonomy of the animal kingdom by studying a bunch of animals, classifying them into categories based on their common features, then classifying those categories into categories based on *their* common features, and so on. For example, one path in mathematics might be Euclidean geometry - >  [inner product functions]( URL_5 ) - >  [norm functions]( URL_3 ) - >  [metrics or distance functions]( URL_1 ) - >  [topologies]( URL_0 ) - >  [sets]( URL_2 ) - >  [foundational axioms]( URL_4 ). At each step, \"structure is lost,\" meaning that you sacrifice some of the special properties of each for the sake of putting concepts into successively bigger groups, like squares passing to rectangles passing to quadrilaterals to polygons, or bumblebees passing to bees passing to order hymenoptera to class insecta. Anyway, the \"facts\" which hold these classifications together and connect among them are called theorems, which in order to be accepted must be able to be logically deduced from the accepted theorems \"above it\" in abstraction. For example, you can prove a statement about squares using facts about rectangles, but not vice versa. (That's what makes it deductive reasoning.) The thing is, just like we could discover a new species of bee tomorrow, we could discover some new fact about a mathematical system that hasn't yet been deduced. Or, perhaps more commonly, we could discover a proof -- pure math's standard of demonstrating logical deduction -- for something that mathematicians \"believe\" to be true based on their knowledge of the field. How would you do that? The same way you discover a new species of bee: get familiar enough with all the existing species so that you can spot the one specimen that doesn't fit the pattern, or a new pattern that no one has spotted before. In math this means immersing yourself in all the recently discovered theorems in your field, looking at how their knowledge was constructed from more general and related principles. And then go immerse yourself in those more general and related theories to understand how they work. And so on. Naturally, you typically have to start with learning a lot of general knowledge in the field, growing more specialized as you go. And then, reading a paper, you spot a theorem that you can take one step further down the line. From a logical perspective, this usually takes the form of a hypothesis you can weaken (\"All red squares are rectangles...\" Wait a minute, they don't need to be red!) or a conclusion you can strengthen (\"All squares are quadrilaterals...\" Wait a minute, they're more specifically rectangles!) And then you embark upon constructing a proof, borrowing recent results as well as general knowledge and often a stroke of insight and creativity to form the logical scaffold of the work. You write up your proof, submit it for publication, present it at conferences, teach it to your graduate students, rinse, and repeat. The last paragraph is probably an answer to what you were asking - the \"process\" of pure math research is difficult to describe because it is so often a slow, deliberative, and creatively frustrating search for the right pieces and the right way to put them together, like being in a room full of mismatched puzzle pieces and trying to put together a picture of the specific dog you had as a child. It can be years of labor for small amounts of progress, and there's no accepted procedure, just as there's no fixed procedure for designing great sculpture. But at least from my end, the few rewards pale in comparison to the thrill of the hunt. If you have the chance to pursue pure math even for a while in university, take it! TL;DR: Boil math down to its essential features. Look for hypotheses to weaken or conclusions to strengthen, and try to prove it."}]}

Because of this daily contact with multiple species of animals and their associated waste along with the fact that their residences were often in very close proximity to animal pens, they had more of a chance for diseases isolated to those animals to cross over (mutate into a form that's transmissible) to humans. There are *a lot* of deadly or harmful diseases that originate in animals often due to their own poor hygiene and general wild conditions. The disease that comes to mind foremost to me is the Bubonic Plague which was spread primarily via fleas on rodents, and reportedly killed off around a third or more of the European population. However, even today, we still have problems with animal to human cross over with diseases like Ebola, Bird Flu, and Mad Cow Disease. Thus, while Native Americans certainly had diseases that were unique to the land and killed off or harmed European settlers, the European settlers simply had more deadly/harmful diseases in their repertoire than the Native Americans did. **Edit:** And as others have mentioned (and I neglected to mention) Europeans tended to have more densely packed urban centers (which were perfect for human to human transmission) and more trade/contact between disparate populations than Native Americans."}]}

No one can know. It's reasonable to suppose that the color you see is about the same as the color that others see, but there is no way to test that hypothesis. It's not just color. When you smell a rose, do you have the same sensation as others who smell the same rose? When you feel a texture, is it the same as others feel? When you pick up something heavy, do you feel the same sensation of weight as others? The list goes on and on. Ultimately, these are questions about consciousness itself. You are conscious of experiencing the color red. By comparison, a very smart computer or robot could, in theory, be programmed to detect the color red, and talk about it in the same way that conscious people talk about it. Would the robot be conscious? How would you know? You can take that even farther. Let's say hyper intelligent aliens built two very sophisticated robots. One is programmed to perceive, act and communicate much as humans do. It is not conscious, but it is programmed to behave and communicate as if it is conscious. The other robot does the same, but it is in fact conscious. How would you tell the two apart? The short answer is, you couldn't. Philosophers have been puzzling over this question for a long time. They aren't getting anywhere. This is called \"The hard question of consciousness.\" There's a wikipedia article about it."}]}

This is dangerous because your body needs a constant supply of oxygen to keep functioning. Things doctors look for to identify whether someone is in shock include low blood pressure, increased heart rate and respiratory rate, low urine output, and confusion. It typically means that a person is very sick. It can be caused by a number of things, however there are 4 basic \"classes\" of shock. It is very important to identify what type of shock a person is in because the treatment for each is very different. The classes are: 1. Distributive: This type of shock involves dilation of your blood vessels, such that adequate blood pressure cannot be maintained. As a result, your tissues and organs don't receive enough blood. The most common cause of this type of shock is sepsis, an inflammatory state in response to a disseminated infection. Other causes include Anaphylaxis -- a severe allergic response to something like peanuts. 2. Hypovolemic: Your body does not have enough blood to circulate to your tissues. This is often seen in trauma victims who have lost a lot of blood (\"hemorrhagic shock\") 3. Cardiogenic: The heart is failing to adequately pump blood throughout the body. This may be due to conditions like heart attacks or irregular rhythms of the heart (i.e. ventricular fibrillation). 4. Obstructive: There is a blockage in the circulatory system preventing the heart from pumping blood throughout the body. The most common cause is a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the vessels of the lungs. The heart cannot mount enough pressure to overcome the blockage created by the clot."}]}

This means that THC lowers blood pressure and widens the veins and capillaries throughout your body, including the ones in your eyes, allowing for more blood flow to these areas. This dilation of blood vessels is also why many people experienced a flushed/red face when high on cannabis, and the drop in blood pressure explains why many people may feel dizzy while high."}]}

That, and a central bank with extraordinarily large quantities of dollars and yuan to spend to defend the exchange rate. Germany and many other Western countries used to have a policy of fixed exchange rates. That changed when savvy people with lots of money figured out that they could \"attack\" the fixed rate. How they \"attacked\" the exchange rate is by borrowing vast quantities of German marks and buying British pounds at the fixed rate. Many investors repeated this until the German banks no longer could afford to sell pounds and buy marks to keep the exchange rate constant. At that point, the price of marks went down, the investors traded back and paid off their loans, and pocketed the difference. This process is simply not possible with China, since China does not allow currency traders to do the things they need to do to attack the exchange rate. Furthermore, the Chinese central bank has vast quantities of USD that they can use to defend the exchange rate."}]}

The law recognizes certain \"protected classes,\" groups of people like blacks, Jews, and (mostly) gays. Their status as a protected class in federal law is currently in transition. If a business is normally open to the public, it is illegal for them to refuse to do business with a protected class. This is one of the things people fought--and even died--for in the civil rights movement. If you don't want to do business with \"those people,\" you are perfectly free to get the fuck OUT of the business and let somebody else have your market share. The people who are citing their religious beliefs today to refuse to do business with icky gay people are using the SAME arguments that people used to use to refuse business to blacks. It is perfectly legal to refuse service to an *individual,* even if they happen to be a member of a protected class. So you can toss out a disruptive crackhead even if he's black. And no, you can't sneak around the law by \"just happening to\" refuse service to a bunch of individuals who \"just happen to be\" members of a protected class. Once a pattern of class discrimination is found, you're in trouble. Although religion is a protected class, the members of *one specific* church are possibly not. You *might* be able to get away with refusing to serve any member of a *specific* church, as long as you have no pattern of discrimination against people of that religion otherwise. You'd probably better have a good lawyer on standby if you wanted to try it, though, especially if the \"church\" is the WBC, which is really just a family of legal trolls who intentionally act outrageously to provoke people into violating their civil rights so they can sue. Mostly, protected classes are things you're born into, not things that you join by choice. There are some exceptions, like family status, pregnancy, etc."}]}

Human beings may or may not be delicious, depending on whether or not you're a fan of veal. [William Seabrook]( URL_0 ) was a guy from about a hundred years ago who got to try out some human meat while on a trip to Guinea. He had this so say: \"It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.\" Veal is really tender and flavourful and fatty, so if you've got taste buds like most of the rest of us, you'd probably find TASTING your BUD to be a pretty yummy experience."}]}

One is a nice considerate kid who was there first and took one, another is a bully, the 3rd is just a w/e average kid. The bully takes the last candy because that's what he's about. Let's say he's rough about it. The nice kid can set aside his sweet tooth to let the other kid get the candy. If either the nice or average kid take issue with the bully being forceful in taking a candy what can they do? Do they try to reason with him? They can, but being a bully chances are he won't give a damn. Do they get angry that someone's just so mean and it escalates physically? Now they're all kicked out from the store and no-one gets any candy. The phrase symbolizes this dynamic. Being nice and considerate leaves you with nothing (other than your self-satisfaction or pride) while being a jerk usually gets you your way. If you're a jerk, most won't bother trying to oppose you over minor stuff, and if they do, you can easily make it so much trouble that their victory feels empty. Of course, it's a rather cynical view-point (but not wholly unwarranted). In the real world, integrity and charity are highly valued by those that care to look for it. For example, the shop owner in the example could have seen the whole thing and just kicked the mean kid out, maybe even given you an extra piece he had on him for being a good kid."}]}

Over time, this brain grew symbiotically with out modern brains, and they communicate through the [vagus nerve]( URL_0 ) It is thought that this is where the \"butterflies in the stomach\" feeling comes from.

Whether this has some specific physiological purpose or is just a remnant of evolution is debatable, as you can see from other answers to your question. Overstimulation of the vagus nerve can also result in a sharp drop in blood pressure, causing fainting, as a last resort defense mechanism.

While I'm not sure how much Bachman knows about the founding fathers, scholars have a pretty good idea on how the founders viewed government and how it should work by reading material they've written such as articles, documents, and letters to other people. As far as the great respect people have for the founders, I think this comes from how they proposed a completely different governmental system that had never existed before. Before then, most governments were ruled by kings, dictators, oligarchies, theocracies, etc... The founders devised a system of self governance, in that the people are the ones in control of the government, and not a ruler chosen by birth, God, or a select few. The founders took great care in crafting the constitution, in that they intended the federal government to be very limited in scope, with only a few responsibilities, while implementing checks and balances to keep the three branches in check. As to why some politicians glorify the works of the founding fathers, I think they're just trying to appeal to the emotions of their constituency, as well as trying to say, \"Hey, I agree with these geniuses!

For example, if your camera runs out of battery, or something moves in shot that shouldn't be there, or you accidentally bump the camera, it's a lot easier to edit that in post processing and simply remove those frames rather than have your whole long exposure ruined.

Isn't it just a shipwreck like the many others?", "output": [{"answer": "She was billed as invincible, she was the biggest passenger liner built at the time and they had one of the most experienced crews of White Star Line at the helm. Unfortunately a chain of completely avoidable errors caused the accident, including the ship having the absolute legal minimum of life boats which was the start of the problem. A last minute reshuffle of senior crew meant that the holder of the key to the cupboard that contained the binoculars ended up not going with the ship, and he simply forgot to hand the key back over. Numerous warnings from ships nearby (notably the Californian which was close by and had stopped surrounded by icebergs) were pushed aside by overworked radio operators who were busy sending and receiving passenger messages. The iceberg was spotted very late due to a moonless night and eerily calm waters, meaning there were no waves crashing against the bottom of the icebergs. Once it was apparent the iceberg was there, First Officer Murdoch attempted a manoeuvre to swing the front of the ship round to the left, and then push the rear of the ship outwards using the propellers in a move called a port-about. However the delay involved in switching the engines to reverse caused the ship to adopt a slow sideways drift towards the berg. Many experts believe that if Murdoch had simply turned the ship at its current speed, it would avoided the collision by some feet. Once the collision had taken place, the Captain was roused and almost immediately told by the ships designer that sinking within 2 hours was a 'mathematical certainty'. The Captain became paralysed with indecision and gave no orders other than to rouse the passengers and put their life jackets on. Prompted by other officers onboard, he ordered the lifeboats to be loaded and lowered saying \"women and children first\". However the officer in charge of one side of the ships evacuation took it as \"women and children ONLY\" and therefore dramatically reduced the amount of passengers to be saved. It is believed the Captain never officially ordered to abandon ship, or even evacuate, with many officers and staff working on their own initiative. The Californian had shut its radios down for the night, and even though both radio operators on the Titanic worked tirelessly sending distress messages (even the yet to be introduced SOS signal), the closest ship was 4 hours away. The Carpathia made full steam through the minefield of icebergs towards the ship that had given its position as 15 nautical miles from where it actually was. The Captain of this ship was later credited with saving nearly every possible survivor. The Titanic shot rockets from the deck which was seen by the Californian, however the Captain elected to ignore them. The sinking of the Titanic was a major wake up call for the authorities to start tightening procedures and regulation, as well as the media attention it received. Imagine the inaugural flight of the Airbus A380 crashing - it would hit news big time. I'm probably missing out a few details as well as having forgotten the vast majority of the crew members' names, but I've given the just of what happened and hopefully it helps.

For instance he was told a story of a group of kids on a field trip who took off on a plane that crashed almost as soon as it was in the air - everyone died. The mothers of the kids wailed and cried - and he asked why no one had bothered to fix the plane (because mechanical failure and crappy repair jobs caused the plane to crash), they replied that \"why bother...God made the plane crash it was meant to be, no foresight on humans could have changed that - or that planes crash all the time, its normal why change it?\" But of course a little foresight would have changed the outcome of that plane crash, if the mechanics had taken their time it would have been avoided - if the cabby had fixed that back seatbelt his passengers wouldn't have died in the car crash...and so on. I guess where I am going with this is that logic, reasoning and cultural norms are very different in Africa and from country to country - going in there many aid groups do their best but their goals may go against the cultural grain... Sometimes the people of the country don't think of long term consequences to actions because they justify them using other means, or they simply say its the way its always been. Lack of education plays a role in this justification, and so does religion, as well as culture and local history. I am not saying that they don't want change - of course those mothers would want their kids back if given a choice, but its as if they don't understand it could have been prevented. It just is."}]}

Finally one I *can* answer: Your computer is finite and has a finite amount of resources. You (as a person) can only multitask and do a few things without slowing down and losing quality of what your trying to do. Don\u2019t believe me? Try writing two different sentences on paper with each hand. Now, instead of trying to do both at the same time, write one word or one sentence after the other. You get it done a lot faster and better. This is what computers do, though they\u2019re a lot faster, they actually do one thing at a time. It just happens to go so fast it looks like they\u2019re doing it at the same time. Now, continuing with our human example, when you\u2019re writing your sentences, what if you don\u2019t know how to spell a word, or your pencil breaks? You have to stop and figure out what went wrong, and try to fix it. If you can\u2019t figure out how to spell it, or don\u2019t own another pencil, you\u2019re stuck. What makes us different than computers is that when something goes wrong for us, we always have alternate solutions. For example, we can grab a pen or look up a word in a dictionary. We can see alternatives. When a computer has these kinds of errors it depends on how well the programmer made the program. If it\u2019s a good program, it has pre-built alternatives that don\u2019t stop it from accomplishing its task. If it\u2019s a poorly written program, or something goes extremely wrong, the program, or the computer entirely will stop because it doesn\u2019t know what to do. This is what causes computers or programs to freeze, or crash."}]}

It is after all a computer prone to errors. Here's how I troubleshoot slow internet: 1) Ping my router. If the ping is double/triple digits, the problem might be there. 2) Ping Google. If the ping is triple/quadruple digits, the problem might be somewhere between my router and Google. 3) Ping the gateway. There are three \"gateways\". The 1st is your router. We've already covered that. The 2nd is the modem. The modem has 2 ip addresses. The first is the IP address between your router and the external IP address of the modem. The second is the external IP address of the modem. Ping the external IP. If the ping is high, double/triple digits, it's the modem. The 3rd gateway is outside your home network entirely and is a router belonging to the ISP. You can find its ip address by looking at your router's WAN page, if it has one. Ping it. If it's triple/quadruple digits the problem isn't yours, it's the ISP's. If none of this gives you poor ping results then the problem is farther out. Time to use another tool. 4) Tracert google. This will show you the hops and their ping times between you and Google. Hops are the routers between you and a destination on the internet that your traffic travels through. This will demonstrate where the slow down is between you and Google and generally if it's your ISP or someone else. Assuming the problem is with your router there are some things you can do. Without getting into more technical aspects, the most effective means of dealing with poor connections between the router and devices is to move the router's antenna as high as possible and centrally locate it, if possible. Change the channel. Wifi routers have about 11 channels to choose from. Defaults for routers are usually channel 6, depending on manufacturer. Moving your router off manufacturer default channels may improve things for you. Change your antennas. You can buy or make more sensitive antennas. [You can also make easily and cheaply using paper, glue  &  tinfoil a sort of directional attachment for existing antennas.]( URL_0 ) Now, if you want to get more technical, try upgrading to a 3rd party firmware like DD-Wrt. Doing so will enable additional metrics  &  features not available in stock manufacturer firmware. 3rd party firmwares often include the ability to adjust transmission power. You can literally spend weeks playing with this feature getting it just right. You can also purchase repeaters that are simple to use. Or, if you have older wifi routers sitting around, using 3rd party firmware will also enable repeater functions if not already available in stock firmware. I've done this and it works extremely well. If you're sharing your router with roommates and/or family, they might be hogging your bandwidth. 3rd party firmware literally turns a $40 router into a $10,000 router by adding features such a QoS (quality of service) allowing you to meter bandwidth based on criteria such as type of traffic and/or devices. This will allow you to give higher priority to traffic such as video streaming and/or VoIP or by allowing your roommates a maximum bandwidth so as to preserve your own or banning certain traffic such as P2P. Sometimes there's nothing you can do given the environment. Steal/concrete constructed buildings will always pose a problem for Wifi. In these environments a mix of technologies might solve certain problems. If you don't want to install networking cable, or can't, then Ethernet over Powerlines might be an option. These devices are fairly cheap turning your average power outlet into a network jack. As with everything, there are limitations and problems to be aware of and overcome."}]}
{"id": "24l24j", "input": "What are surveyors doing when I see them looking through that tripod?", "output": [{"answer": "Surveyors use levels to find level, theodolites for relative angle and tape for distance. Laser range finders have been incorporated in the last twenty years to make total stations that combine all three capabilities. There are also laser levels that draw a standard height or line. Sort of common uses are to stake out the positions of the centreline of curve in a road. In that case they calculate the entry into the curve, then through the curve the radius is steady. For laying out a curve in a road the station can be set at the beginning of the curve then regular distances marked off along the curve with regular increases in angular divergence. So the first mark at 100m might be 2.5 degrees, 2nd mark at 200m is at 5 degrees etc. With computers there's no longer any need to setup in a simple way like that. The station can be put more or less anywhere nearby. The location of the station is only constrained by the error in the relative measurements. Elevation, transit angle and distance all have errors involved. There are standard methods of determining positions and levels that seek to correct for, minimize and check for errors. A simple one is to 'tie back in' when running a transit level. So if our survey is measuring heights of roadways near a benchmark we don't just go out with a rod and level to determine the heights through 8 setups, we also have to setup a return route to come back after our survey and tie in our height to the original benchmark to show we haven't gone too far off level during our survey. A level survey is done by setting up the tripod near a hard point that is at a known height. That is called a benchmark. The rod is set on the benchmark. The level can measure the relative height of the eyepiece, let's say the eyepiece is 2'3\" above the benchmark. Then the first shot is taken maybe 45 m away. The level has stayed in its spot and now measures its height at the eyepiece relative to its height above the spot the rod was placed as 8'4\". That's recorded. It indicates that the rodman has the rod resting on an object that is 2'3\"-8'4\" or 6'1\" below the height of the benchmark. The level moves, the rodman stays at their spot and the level sets up to take a shot at the same spot the rodman was at before. Let's say the shot shows 4'2\" as the height the eyepeice is above the spot the rod is set. That shows that the height of the eyepiece is now -6'1\"+4'2\" or 1'11\" below the height of the benchmark. My guess is that surveying will start using image recognition to automatically map topography and locations. It would speed things up a lot."}]}
{"id": "32gawc", "input": "Why isn't the horror genre as respected as other film genres?", "output": [{"answer": "While I think that the current top comment by /u/o0joshua0o is the closet to summing things up (others have added a few solid points as well), there is still something missing. I'll try to best explain my point in a way fitting to ELI5, though this might lead to a fairly long post. The short of it is this: scaring people is easy. It isn't that the story is lacking impact or that it relies on gruesome visuals or jump-scares. If the goal of a story (a book, a movie, etc.) is to scare and it manages to do just that, then it has made a solid impact. This can be anything from the many kid-friendly campfire stories about men with hooks for hands to various urban legends or creepypastas about sleep experiments to novels about a father and husband who struggles to be a good man while dealing with his personal demons (that also happens to have a popular film adaptation that completely misses the point). Storytelling is all about the manipulation of the audience. It is like a magic act. But rather than having an audience who wants to believe an elephant can really disappear then reappear, a storyteller has an audience that wants their emotions manipulated for the purpose of entertainment. Whether it involves making them laugh, cry, or fear for their own well-being is not entirely irrelevant though it is most important that they at least feel *something* during the performance. And a good storyteller will manage to illicit at least one or more of even the most basic emotional responses all without the audience being actively aware that they are being manipulated. An audience wants to believe in the illusion. They know the story you're telling them isn't real, or at the very least isn't actually taking place at that very moment. It involves words on a page, or a man sitting at a campfire, or actors on a stage. A bad storyteller will rely heavily on familiarity to get their point across. A reused joke. A familiar plot and twist. Cliches that are meant to act as emotional shorthand, like putting a mother and child inside a burning building. The whole \"showing, not telling\" thing you often hear in writing courses or in threads like those in /r/books. The audience is, at that point, doing all the emotional work. They have to make all those connections. That music means something exciting is happening. The fat guy fell down so I need to laugh at his being fat and clumsy. Or, back to my previous example, that mother and child are in danger so I should feel concern for their safety. Shorthand is fine. And reusing old material is as well. But it's all in the execution. Anyone can reference an old Simpson's gag or quote Airplane (just look at all the reposts on reddit or anywhere else for proof of that). But not everyone can make people actually laugh at it the same way they had the first time they saw or heard it. If any laughter happens at all, it's more because they fondly recall that original moment. And this is getting to what I mean by \"scaring people is easy\". Comedy, generally speaking, is really hard. Getting a genuine laugh from people is a lot of work. Timing, delivery. To take a very basic observation and present it in such a way that gets a crowd to snort and chuckle is a quest unto itself. A bad joke or weak delivery can stink up the house real quick. Drama is the same way. A combination of a solid performance of at least passable material is required to illicit a positive response from the audience. Stilted line delivery can suck any and all emotion out of a romantic scene between lovers. Cringe-worthy dialog can lead even the most tense moment into melodrama and result in laughs from an audience. Even action requires a strong understanding of framing, editing, pacing in addition to solid choreography. An action scene is a story unto itself. The fight. The chase, be it toward a goal or away from an antagonist. It's a story within a story. And a poorly shot action sequence will not keep an audience on the edge of their seats. Weak stunt work will not get them to cheer. A poorly framed or edited punch will look fake and break the illusion. But scaring people is easy. We're all afraid of something. We all are hardwired to feel things like anxiety and stress. And to trigger such things isn't hard because it involves primitive responses to stimuli that have kept us alive generation after generation. This is why a jump scare will work on many if not most people. A video with a sudden, disturbing image and a loud audio cue is no different to the human brain than a wolf jumping out of the bushes. Horror doesn't necessarily require an emotional response so much as it does a physical and chemical response. Empathy with any of Freddy's victim isn't required to enjoy A Nightmare on Elm Street. Stilted delivery won't necessarily detract from the gore or jump scare. So long as your nervous system is lighting up and your body is flooded with things like adrenaline, the scene or story works just fine. This is why a lot of storytellers, a lot of filmmakers can cut their teeth with horror and transition to something else. All the basic ingredients are there for a good movie. Lighting. Music. Framing. It's an entry level attempt at all the emotional manipulation required in dramas and comedy. But the bar is set so low for an effective horror movie that even a weak effort can be seen as a success. Low-budgets also help convince studios to take risks on inexperienced talent. A lot of directors and actors started off in horror. Dementia 13 was one of Francis Ford Coppola's first directing jobs. Spielberg made a name for himself with Jaws. That [guy]( URL_5 ) who helped bring one of the most successful superhero franchises of all time to the big screen started off making a no-budget horror flick with his brother and big-chinned friend where a tree rapes a girl. And the dude with the two highest grossing films of [all time]( URL_3 ) started off making a sequel to a movie about killer fish, then did a movie about a killer robot, and then did a sequel about killer aliens before doing a movie about a killer robot fighting another killer robot. Not to mention the likes of actors like [Johnny Depp]( URL_1 ), [Jennifer Connelly]( URL_11 ), [Kevin Bacon]( URL_12 ), and [Crispin Glover]( URL_6 ) who all got early breaks in horror. Or even established talent that find themselves diving into (or even returning to) horror like [Gary Oldman]( URL_7 ), [Frank Langella]( URL_10 ), [Willem Dafoe]( URL_8 ), and [Sir Ian McKellen]( URL_2 ). Scaring people is easy. And even the most [mundane]( URL_4 ), [uneventful] ( URL_0 ), [low-reaching]( URL_9 ) horror films can become runaway successes. It isn't the talent involved. It isn't the story failing to make an impact. It's that anyone with a camera and a few friends can make it happen and garner some attention. Of course, like all other genres it takes a lot of work and effort and talent to master the horror genre. So few names have managed to do it compared to others. When everyone can be scared, when we all share so many of the same fears, it takes a real creative mind to present something so daringly unsettling that it not only perseveres for years to come but also illicit the same emotional response. King, Barker, Lovecraft, Poe, Romero, Craven, Hooper, Carpenter, and so many others have mastered the genre. Some stick around and love to play in the same sandbox time and again. Others move on to the next challenge, maybe returning now and then when the mood strikes them. It isn't that horror isn't respected. It's that scaring people isn't hard. Keeping people afraid is. And so few manage to do it just right."}]}
{"id": "51tgax", "input": "Why does using data on phones cost so much money?", "output": [{"answer": "In the US, the primary cause is scarcity, and the one limiting factor for wireless carriers is access to the wireless spectrum. (Source: I've deployed GSM networks) In much the same way your ISP provides you with a limited amount of bandwidth, the throughput of a wireless connection is also limited, and the total area being served by a cellular broadcast tower needs to be divided up between all the people who wish to use it. Compared to voice calls and many other wireless users, cellular data is bandwidth-intensive, and require large portions of spectrum to transmit data at high speeds. The highest-capacity towers are serving up at most a few hundred MB of total capacity. For many of us, this capacity isn't much greater than our home WIFI. When cellular communication hit the market, the FCC had already reserved the rights to the best parts of the wireless spectrum for radio, television, government, industrial, or medical use (which could be best utilized by cheap, reliable hardware). So, wireless companies bid on whatever portions of the spectrum they can get their hands on (which also drives up the prices). Some of these portions of the spectrum required new or specialized (and more expensive equipment) to operate. For example, in 2008, the rights to use the 700mhz spectrum was auctioned for about $12B US. I believe the networks who were able to secure the largest portions of usage rights in this deal, at best, doubled their capacity in some areas. Also, there is effectively an upper-limit to the portion of the spectrum that can be used for mobile communication devices. In order to maximize battery life, cell phones need to transmit at very low power. And, at lower wattages, lower-frequency signals will have an advantage, attenuating at a much slower rate, and traveling much farther. The only real option available now to combat the high cost of the wireless spectrum is to deploy smaller cell towers more densely, which each cover a much smaller area. If the area was reduced significantly, new portions of the spectrum would be available at higher frequencies, and low-power broadcast would still be feasible, since the total broadcast distance is reduced. Prices are not likely to come down any time soon. However, advances in battery technology or the mass deployment of very small (pico) cell towers could one day dramatically reduce costs. TLDR; Not all portions of the wireless spectrum are \u201ccreated\u201d equally, and demand is very high for the best parts of it. This is driving up prices, and activities which utilize it the heaviest (such as wireless data), are forced to pay a premium for it."}]}

That is, how much money does it cost to make, install, and maintain enough solar panels to create [X] watts of power capacity. Right now, solar is still being developed, and it cannot yet compete economically with more established conventional electricity generation, mostly coal and natural gas, with nontrivial amounts coming from hydroelectricity and nuclear. (Wind and biomass are pretty small compared with the other four I listed, but are most of the remainder.) Consumers demand electricity, and rational economic agents would seek to get it at the lowest possible price, so in the absence of regulatory action, they would get their electricity from coal and natural gas, which are cheaper per watt-hour (i.e. energy/Joules). However, coal and natural gas both have pollution externalities - the pollution produced by burning coal is really nasty (not just carbon pollution, which contributes to climate change, but also sulfur, NOx, and heavy metal contaminates, which are ugly stuff), and consumers aren't paying for the harm caused by this pollution. Therefore, we want to steer policy in the direction toward cleaner fuels, of which solar is a part. The problem is just what your title asks - solar isn't yet cost-effective enough to compete with natural gas and coal (though it probably will be in five years). This is because we are still making great advancements in developing solar technology (it's a relatively new and highly technical field). So, in order to stimulate investment into the solar industry, we have to subsidize it somehow, generally either through adoption credits (giving tax rebates to people who install solar panels), feed-in tariffs (mandating that your utility company compensates the supplier for the electricity that household/business generates), or carbon taxes (not exactly a subsidy, but a tax on coal acts in a similar manner to a subsidy on coal). The hope is that with a temporary subsidy, we can get enough investment in the industry to make solar cheaper than natural gas and coal, after which point we permanently move into a clean-energy world. If there is enough demand for solar (because of government subsidies), this encourages innovation into the solar industry, which should lower the cost of adoption (either by making the photovoltaic cells themselves more efficient, cheaper to produce, lowering installation costs, economies of scale, etc.) to the point where solar can compete as a cost effective alternative to conventional electricity generation. But we're not quite to the point where solar can directly compete on the basis of costs alone. (Storage capacity is a big part of this.) I'd be glad to elaborate further on any part of this."}]}

Foreigners were not welcome, and Japanese were not allowed to travel. This ended in 1853 when an American navy fleet led by Commodore Perry [sailed in]( URL_4 ) and said \"Hi, you're going to be trading with us now.... or else.\" The Japanese leadership was still stuck with 200-year-old technology -- literally bows and arrows and swords -- and had nothing to fight back against modern steam warships. So they had no choice but to agree to Perry's demands. Over the next few years, other world powers including Russia also used their navy to push Japan around. Japan was humiliated, and decided to do something about it. They engaged in a crash program of modernization. During the [Meiji]( URL_3 ) era, they hired westerners to teach science and engineering, built railroads, factories, modern schools and hospitals, and most importantly, conscripted a powerful modern army and navy. Within 30 years, Japan had become a modern industrial nation, powerful enough to defend itself against western powers. But that meant it was also powerful enough to go up against its neighbors. As a small island nation, Japan had limited food and mineral resources, and was worried about attack from foreign powers. And hey, if you've got a modern army and navy, there's a huge temptation to use it. To keep its new modern society running, Japan decided to [attack Korea]( URL_1 ), which was very weak militarily, and under the control of China, which had a much less modern military and was dealing with a major revolt on the other side of China at the time. Japan won handily, taking over Korea. Several more conflicts followed against [Russia]( URL_2 ) and China, centered around Japan being worried that they might try to take Korea away, and Russia and China being worried that Japan might not stop with Korea. Japan won all of them, eventually leaving them with control of all of Manchuria (what's now northern China). Not just the coastline, as /u/Dueling7 describes, but up to 700 miles inland to the modern border of Mongolia and Russia. This gave Japan control over the resources of a huge region, and the (unwilling) labor of about 45 million people. This, plus their technological superiority, made them the most powerful empire in the region. So the main answer to the question is that Japan engaged in a crash modernization program after being bullied by Western powers, but it's worth mentioning that things in China were not going nearly as well at the time. The ruling Qing dynasty were ethnic Manchurians, and not popular among the majority Han Chinese. Several popular uprisings against the emperor occurred during this time. In addition, Western powers were working hard to get the entire country hooked on opium so they could profit off it, and several failed revolts against Western trade occurred as a result. China tried to carry out the same modernization program the Japanese were pursuing, but civil unrest and foreign meddling made it impossible."}]}

We declared war on Afghanistan and Iraq, so nobody much minds if we try and kill people there. We also say we're in a \"war on terror.\" What the fuck that means, nobody really knows. You can't be at war with an idea. You can be at war with a defined group of people, and Congress also passed a bill after September 11th saying that the president could take any steps necessary to kill or capture the people behind the September 11th attack, or in other words, Al Qaeda. We have, for the most part. Is Congress' declaration still good to let us go around killing whoever the fuck we want as long as somebody, somewhere, is still using the name \"Al Qaeda\"? Nobody knows. If you take the view that it is not --- that is, the view that has held for pretty much all of civilization, which is that just going around and killing anyone who might pose a threat to you someday is fucked up and should be illegal --- then drone attacks are a problem. As a general rule, crossing other country's borders with your military and killing people is regarded as an act of war. The reason we're getting away with it is that we have this vague \"war on terror\" fig leaf and also we're the richest country in the world and have the biggest military, so no matter how much other countries don't like it, there's really very little they can do to stop it. 2, terrorists aren't the only casualties of drone attacks. Civilians are often killed. Sure, you might argue that they're often somehow connected to the terrorist --- their wives and children and cousins, people sheltering them. Sometimes though, it's just someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the intelligence was wrong in the first place. If we're at war, then this is maybe legal.

{"id": "3u0eam", "input": "How are refugees vetted?", "output": [{"answer": "**A friend of mine is an immigration lawyer in the US. He posted a really comprehensive answer to this question on Facebook the other day. Below is his description in full (rather long). Note, this applies to the process in the US.** Most of my friends know I practice Immigration law. As such, I have worked with the refugee community for over two decades. This post is long, but if you want actual information about the process, keep reading. I can not tell you how frustrating it is to see the misinformation and outright lies that are being perpetuated about the refugee process and the Syrian refugees. So, here is a bit of information from the real world of someone who actually works and deals with this issue. The refugee screening process is multi-layered and is very difficult to get through. Most people languish in temporary camps for months to years while their story is evaluated and checked. First, you do not get to choose what country you might be resettled into. If you already have family (legal) in a country, that makes it more likely that you will go there to be with family, but other than that it is random. So, you can not simply walk into a refugee camp, show a document, and say, I want to go to America. Instead, the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees) works with the local authorities to try to take care of basic needs. Once the person/family is registered to receive basic necessities, they can be processed for resettlement. Many people are not interested in resettlement as they hope to return to their country and are hoping that the turmoil they fled will be resolved soon. In fact, most refugees in refugee events never resettle to a third country. Those that do want to resettle have to go through an extensive process. Resettlement in the U.S. is a long process and takes many steps. The Refugee Admissions Program is jointly administered by the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) in the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and offices within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) within DHS conducts refugee interviews and determines individual eligibility for refugee status in the United States. We evaluate refugees on a tiered system with three levels of priority. First Priority are people who have suffered compelling persecution or for whom no other durable solution exists. These individuals are referred to the United States by UNHCR, or they are identified by the U.S. embassy or a non-governmental organization (NGO). Second priority are groups of \u201cspecial concern\u201d to the United States. The Department of State determines these groups, with input from USCIS, UNHCR, and designated NGOs. At present, we prioritize certain persons from the former Soviet Union, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Iran, Burma, and Bhutan. Third priority are relatives of refugees (parents, spouses, and unmarried children under 21) who are already settled in the United States may be admitted as refugees. The U.S.-based relative must file an Affidavit of Relationship (AOR) and must be processed by DHS. Before being allowed to come to the United States, each refugee must undergo an extensive interviewing, screening, and security clearance process conducted by Regional Refugee Coordinators and overseas Resettlement Support Centers (RSCs). Individuals generally must not already be firmly resettled (a legal term of art that would be a separate article). Just because one falls into the three priorities above does not guarantee admission to the United States. The Immigration laws require that the individuals prove that they have a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d (another legal term which would be a book.) This fear must be proved regardless of the person\u2019s country, circumstance, or classification in a priority category. There are multiple interviews and people are challenged on discrepancies. I had a client who was not telling the truth on her age and the agency challenged her on it. Refugees are not simply admitted because they have a well founded fear. They still must show that they are not subject to exclusion under Section 212(a) of the INA. These grounds include serious health matters, moral or criminal matters, as well as security issues. In addition, they can be excluded for such things as polygamy, misrepresentation of facts on visa applications, smuggling, or previous deportations. Under some circumstances, the person may be eligible to have the ground waived. At this point, a refugee can be conditionally accepted for resettlement. Then, the RSC sends a request for assurance of placement to the United States, and the Refugee Processing Center (RPC) works with private voluntary agencies (VOLAG) to determine where the refugee will live. If the refugee does have family in the U.S., efforts will be made to resettle close to that family. Every person accepted as a refugee for planned admission to the United States is conditional upon passing a medical examination and passing all security checks. Frankly, there is more screening of refugees than ever happens to get on an airplane. Of course, yes, no system can be 100% foolproof. But if that is your standard, then you better shut down the entire airline industry, close the borders, and stop all international commerce and shipping. Every one of those has been the source of entry of people and are much easier ways to gain access to the U.S. Only upon passing all of these checks (which involve basically every agency of the government involved in terrorist identification) can the person actually be approved to travel. Before departing, refugees sign a promissory note to repay the United States for their travel costs. This travel loan is an interest-free loan that refugees begin to pay back six months after arriving in the country. Once the VOLAG is notified of the travel plans, it must arrange for the reception of refugees at the airport and transportation to their housing at their final destination. This process from start to finish averages 18 to 24 months, but I have seen it take years. The reality is that about half of the refugees are children, another quarter are elderly. Almost all of the adults are either moms or couples coming with children. Each year the President, in consultation with Congress, determines the numerical ceiling for refugee admissions. For Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, the proposed ceiling is 85,000. We have been averaging about 70,000 a year for the last number of years. (Source: Refugee Processing Center) Over one-third of all refugee arrivals (35.1 percent, or 24,579) in FY 2015 came from the Near East/South Asia\u2014a region that includes Iraq, Iran, Bhutan, and Afghanistan. Another third of all refugee arrivals (32.1 percent, or 22,472) in FY 2015 came from Africa. Over a quarter of all refugee arrivals (26.4 percent, or 18,469) in FY 2015 came from East Asia \u2014 a region that includes China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. (Source: Refugee Processing Center) Finally, the process in Europe is different. I would be much more concerned that terrorists are infiltrating the European system because they are not nearly so extensive and thorough in their process."}]}

That's why marriage equality was important a few years ago. If someone was with their partner for 15 years and then suddenly dropped dead, their partner had better hope their in-laws liked them or even supported the partnership in the first place. If not, the parents could just take the house and all the money (provided the person didn't have a will). There are probably other benefits, but I think this is one of the big ones."}]}

According to the rules we discovered when measuring magnetic fields (Maxwell\u2019s equations and Lorenz invariance), electric fields have to travel at a fixed speed regardless of the speed of anything else. Photons are a kind of wave in the electric field (electric and magnetic fields are really the same and relativity is what causes magnetic fields too). This is the speed of light. But that\u2019s confusing. If you're on a train going nearly the speed of light and then flip on a flashlight, it seems like either you would perceive the speed of light as slower relative to your fast speed or your speed gets added to the speed of light and a stationary observer would disagree about the speed of light. But the equations say neither happens. Somehow both observers would see the speed of light the same relative to themselves. But are the equations right? Measurements like the Michaelson-Morely experiment seem to back this up. When lasers are fired North-South and compared with lasers fired East-West (adding the rotational speed of the earth, roughly 1,000 mph) there isn't a difference in measured speed of light at all. How can this be? Well Einstein figured out that of you do the math (simple geometry really) the implication is that a bunch of really counter-intuitive things happen to allow light to stay a fixed speed. *Space itself warps* to accommodate a fixed speed of light relative to all observers. One of these warping effects happens in gravitational fields. At the big bang, things were really really compressed, so there was a lot of gravity. As the universe expanded, some parts remained dense with high gravity. Since space was compressed and really space and time are related just like electricity and magnetism are related it means time was compressed too. Areas that did not expand spatially, also didn't expand temporally. Time didn't pass in those places as fast as it has here."}]}

There's a difference between biological sex and gender identity. Your biological sex is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics, male or female. This is in most cases a binary, except in the case of individuals born with ambiguous sexual characteristics, often termed \"intersex\" individuals because their biological sex falls somewhere between simple \"male\" or \"female\". \"Gender\" is socially constructed, meaning that we as societies and individuals determine what it means to be male or female. Behavior, appearance, dress, speech, all are examples of gender norms. Gender roles change over time and space, meaning that what it means to be a woman or a man means different things in different places. People referring to there being more than 2 genders may be in reference to the idea that gender is fluid, or is kind of like a spectrum. People express their gender identity in shades- for instance, some women wear dresses, some women wear pants, some men are masculine, some men are less masculine- there are thousands of ways to express gender."}]}

To increase the yield of a crop, the crop is genetically altered to scare away/kill any bugs that typically eat it. The crop is a success and is sold everywhere. 5 years later a bug has become immune to the implanted defense mechanism and starts to eat the crop.

These are laws being made by politicians so they are looking at numbers primarily. Vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people in the US under the age of 55. Over half of these deaths happen to people that were not wearing a seat belt. This is not to say that all of them could have been prevented had the person been wearing a seat belt but a lot of them likely could have been. By passing seat belt legislation, politicians are addressing one of the main causes of death for people under the age of 55. That is good politics and has a major impact on reducing traffic fatalities. For motorcycles, there are far less deaths than compared to passenger vehicles. In fact, until the seat belt laws began to take effect, motorcycle deaths regularly made up less than 10% of all vehicle related fatalities. After those laws began being enforced with fines more universally, passenger vehicle fatalities began dropping and motorcycle fatalities began to make up about 12-13% of all vehicle related fatalities. The real issue with motorcycles is the impact that helmets can have and despite this, only 19 states require helmets.

{"id": "557drz", "input": "Why are there so few venomous creatures in the UK and Northern Europe?", "output": [{"answer": "A little late to post, but I have some knowledge in this. First off, the two things you mention are very different. **Venomous** means that the creature (animal) is capable of injecting toxins by means of a bite or a sting. **Toxic** creatures (also including things like caterpillars and poison arrow frogs) are not safe to eat because they have toxins in their bodies (or leaves/stems/flowers/roots/berries). Poisonous plants are generally considered toxic. (For true ELI5, scroll down to the TL;DR) Now the two are very different evolutionarily but they do have a common component: making toxins is metabolically expensive. That means that it takes a lot of energy to make toxins. It only makes sense to produce toxins if there is a lot of evolutionary pressure to do so. In fact there have been studies done on plants that suggests when non-native species are introduced to a new area, because there are usually less predators that feed on them in the new area, they tend to lose the potency of their toxicity (the study was specifically on weedy plant species). ** Now, a lot of people in this thread have made two claims: A) that there is a lot less biodiversity in cooler climates (which is true) and B) that human populations have been a driving factor in eliminating venomous/toxic species. To address the second point: this is obviously not the case because there are plenty of toxic/venomous species in tropical areas with high human populations. In fact, regions like Siberia and Canada have a very low human population and fewer venomous/toxic species and places like India and Nigeria have high populations of human and high populations of venomous species. To address the biodiversity claim, thats partially true. Since there are fewer species further north (because there are fewer resources like sunlight), this results in fewer overall numbers of venomous/toxic species. I would argue, however, that there is still a similar percentage of *toxic* species, compared to the tropics. For example there are plenty of toxic caterpillar species (monarch butterfly, for example) and, some amphibian species (Pickerel frog) and many toxic plant species (hemlock, or poison ivy). But that does not address the lack of *venomous* species in northern climates. There are examples, such as many spiders, and bees and wasps, but venomous species make up a smaller percentage of species than warmer climates. The reason for this is two fold: evolution and size. Venomous species tend to have evolved in a couple specific groups. The list includes: spiders, bees/wasps/ants, snakes, a handful of truly venomous lizards (the Gila monster), centipedes, jellyfish, many species of fish, and some mammals. When looking at the list, every singles species that is venomous is cold blooded (ectothermic) with the exception of mammals. When looking at the mammals that are venomous they are all very primitive: insectivores such as shrews, and the platypus (male only). It has been proposed that the reason most mammals never evolved a need for venom is because mammals evolved much stronger jaw bones and jaw muscles than their ancestors the lizards and snakes. Mammals were capable of actively killing their prey with their newly evolved jaws, teeth and retractable claws, whereas most reptiles killed more passively. This makes sense, being ectothermic, that snakes (as well as spiders, scorpions, jellyfish, fish etc) kill their prey with a single bite/sting, and then wait for the animal to die, exerting less energy overall. The venom found in the few species of shrew is a little bit different. From Wikipedia:  > Shrews cache various prey in a comatose state, including earthworms, insects, snails, and to a lesser extent, small mammals such as voles and mice. This behaviour is an adaption to winter. In this context, the shrew venom acts as a tool to sustain a living hoard, thus ensuring food supply when capturing prey is difficult. Keep in mind that these shrews are insectivores, meaning that they only eat insects and small vertibrates, no nuts/berries. Comparing this to mice, which do eat nuts and berries, despite their similar size, the mouse jawbow is much stronger than their shrew counterpart. There are handful of venomous shrews, no known venomous mice. Coming back to the main point, there is one species of toxic mammal in Europe, the european mole, which does use it venom to paralyze earthworms. It is likely that mice, being able to store nuts/berries through the winter, AND eat insect in the warmer months, are better equipped to survive in colder months than the weaker jawed shrew. The second point I was going to make was about colder climates, size and body temperature. Bergmann's rule states that generally: the further north you go, the larger the size of the animals. The theory behind this is that when an animal is larger, it's volume increases faster than surface area, making it relatively easier to maintain a constant temperature. Likewise in warmer climates, a smaller body sheds heat faster than larger body. There are exceptions to this, there are mice that live in cold areas and elephants that live in warm areas, but both within species and among species this rule is generally true. For example, in western hemisphere, the white tailed deer live from Venezuela, all the way up to Canada. The tropical subspecies of the deer are significantly smaller than their arctic brethren. Why is this important when talking about venom? Well, the larger the prey, the stronger the venom required to bring down the prey. The stronger the venom (usually) the more expensive it is to metabolically produce. And remember, the northern climates already have less energy available in the food chain than tropical climates. This likely helps to explain why we never see something like poisonous wolves or big cats, as stronger jaws are better at killing large prey faster than a very expensive to produce toxin. The one time we do see something like this is in the Komodo dragon, which is a more passive \"venom\". The lizard will bite it's large prey and then just follow, chill and wait, sometimes a week or more, for the beast to die. (Originally the thought was that the venom is bacterial, recent research has called that into question, as the venom may be an anticoagulant that then encourages infection of the open wound). Since the Komodo Dragon lives in a warm climate, they have less of an issue waiting for an animal to die, compared to a wolf which needs to maintain it's body temperature in the cold climate. **TL;DR**: *Toxic* plants and animals do exist in northern climates. *Venomous* creatures aren't as well represented because northern climates tend to favor larger animals, especially mammals, who have other adaptations like strong jaws that make venom unnecessary. ** (Not ELI5, but a couple people have asked me about metabolic cost of toxin production, specifically in snakes. I was taught, back in the early 2000's that it was more expensive to produce more powerful toxins, but in doing some quick research to answer their question, it seems that the research has changed. Studies [here]( URL_0 ) (caution paywall) and [here]( URL_1 ) both suggest the cost of snake toxin production is quite low. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I standby the plant studies that plants, over generations without evolutionary pressure, will begin to reduce toxin production in favor of growth (the 'non-native plant species exposed to new lands' study I alluded above)."}]}

They work by inhibiting certain mechanisms in the body, including the ones that cause inflammation. Basically, your cells can produce a lipid (fatty) compound called prostaglandin. It's part of your body's immune/pathogenic response, or how your body reacts to an infection, presence of a foreign body, or trauma. It encourages functions that help your body fight off pathogens and begin to heal. \"Inhibitors\" work in a particular way. Essentially, your cells have what are called receptor sites where certain chemicals and compounds can \"connect\" to the cell, if you will. Inhibitors work by taking up some of those spots so there's less room for whatever chemical you're trying to prevent from affecting the cell. Imagine that for whatever reason you want to keep a particular group of people off of a bus. You could try to get other people to fill in all of the seats first. Not a perfect analogy, but I think it sort of helps. Prostaglandin causes inflammation and an increase in temperature, i.e. a fever. Fever, swelling, redness, and pain are all generally interconnected as part of your immune response. To a certain degree, stop the prostaglandin, stop the fever. Prostaglandin also has many other functions, including controlling smooth muscle structures in your body, like blood vessels and the intestines, which is why people who fear they are having a heart attack or are having chest pain will often chew a few \"baby Aspirin.\" It causes widening of the arteries which can help resolve issues with blood supply to the heart muscle. Ultimately, the prostaglandin is one of the common factors in the fever, headache, and sore throat you might be experiencing. Acetominophen and ibuprofen can't stop it from being generated really, but it keeps that stuff from getting where it needs to be to cause a fever, etc. I hope this was helpful, I'm really weak when it comes to pharmacology but I've always found it interesting.

I'll save the complex talk for another article, but what is important to note is that a high-end watch typically uses a hand-made, super-accurate automatic movement. These movements are constructed of very small gears, springs and synthetic jewels to prevent friction. So small, in fact, that even a speck of dust can through off the accuracy of a watch. If you compared an expensive watch to a to low-end, you would notice that the more expensive of the two is made of much nicer materials and that everything just seems to look and feel right. I know, it sounds so corny, but it's true. The high-quality watch has the right amount of polish, the movement sounds right (the ticks), the crown clicks and functions flawlessly and the band is heavy duty.

Well, you'd be an idiot to think that watch value is based on those details alone. Many of the best watch brands are rich in history and extremely trusted. When buying a top-tier watch, there is no doubt that you'll be paying a pretty penny to be a part of that history.

And Facebook makes *loads* of money from advertising. From a [CNN article]( URL_0 ) on Facebook's acquisition of Whatsapp:  >  Facebook said it is not looking to drive revenue from WhatsApp in the near term, instead focusing on growth. Zuckerberg said he doesn't anticipate trying to aggressively grow WhatsApp's revenue until the service reaches \"billions\" of users. This is a common approach for many consumer Internet companies, even those that don't have Facebook's hefty bank account to fund them. This is particularly true if your product relies on any kind of social network, because the value of those products increase with the amount of users on the network. The more people who have Whatsapp installed, the more people you can communicate with through it, and the more valuable it becomes to each of those users. It's hard to make money if you only have a ten thousand users because (a) putting hurdles like fees or ads in front of users will slow growth and (b) it's too easy for that small group of users to all jump ship for a competing service. Therefore, many vendors -- especially those of social apps -- first focus on building a *huge* user base. Because if you have ten million users, it's likely they depend on that network more heavily than they do if you only had ten thousand users. Once you've got them hooked, then you can start finding ways to squeeze money out of the users (or, if you take the ad approach, use that huge user base to squeeze money out of advertisers)."}]}

Some older machine guns were even water-cooled, or had rotating barrels that would share the thermal load (i.e. the classic Gatling gun).

Perhaps the biggest difference, in that sense, is that classical physics is purely deterministic. Particles have location and momentum, and that's basically it. If you know these things accurately enough, then you know exactly what they will do in any given situation. Quantum physics, by contrast, shows that the more certain you are about one of those, the less certain you can be about the other, since you've changed it when you measured it. Think about it like this: I want to know where something is, so I look at it. The process of looking requires photons to have bounced off it and then hit my retina. Now, for the sort of objects we're familiar with, photons bouncing off it has no real impact. When you're talking about incredibly small things though, the photons have similar momentum (energy, technically) so they have a significant effect. It's like instead of throwing bouncy balls at a car, you're throwing motorbikes. Now, an interesting and related property is that on a quantum scale, things exist as probabilities, they don't really have a discrete location, just areas where they are more or less likely to be, and can pop in and out of existence at random. *All* things in the universe smaller than an atom behave like this (and possibly some atoms too, research on that is ongoing). The reason we don't see this sort of behavior from larger objects is because of probability again, in order for a classically sized object to randomly disappear, a **huge** number of constituent particles would need to do something unlikely, all at once (like if you were to take 10,000,000,000,000 dice and roll them all at once, and every single one comes up six) tl;dr: when things get really, really small, we can't find them anymore."}]}

{"id": "1jsye0", "input": "why do the touch screens of some mobile phones only work with the finger. They dont work with a pen or anything else.

The surface of the panel forms a capacitor with your body and the circuitry senses this. It requires a slightly conductive pointer, hence why a hotdog will work but an insulating pen wont. A resistive touchscreen (they are *slightly* squishy to press) relies on physical pressure, so any pointer will work with them. Then there's infra red touchscreens too, which line up a row of sensors and IR transmitters (like a row of tiny versions of your TV remote) along the edges of the screen and sense your finger blocking the light from travelling from one side to another.

Western religions tended to develop as an *orthodoxy,* which means that you have to think what the church tells you to think. Buddhism specifically (other eastern religions may have as well) developed as an *orthopraxy,* which means you have to practice how the authority figures tell you to practice. This is a very important difference, as early Buddhists were allowed to think whatever they wanted, so long as the chanted the right words and sat in the right place. There are also ideological differences. As a Buddhist, I can account for the existence of other religions, since other ideologies do not threaten my beliefs or teaching. Western religions, however, tend to teach very polarized ideologies, which means that Buddhism cannot exist within Christianity. Lastly, I've had multiple professors and religious figures say that eastern religions aren't actually religions, since they fundamentally have little in common with the practices in the west. Since Buddhism and Shinto are more about ways to live your life, it's easier to accept other religions and ideas, whereas Christianity is specifically concerned with being right and making a single choice."}]}

So, let's pretend your job is making Ninja Turtle action figures in my Ninja Turtle factory. I pay you ten gummy bears an hour for making these Ninja Turtle dolls. Now, I think you're a good worker, so I want to pay you fifteen gummy bears instead of ten. The U.S. government steps in and says, \"No! That's not fair. You can only pay ecfunj1 ten gummy bears an hour. That's the law. It's for the greater good- we're in a war, doncha know.\" Now I, being the staunchly capitalist factory owner that I am, who thinks that you should be paid what you're worth, say, \"Well, you're not the boss of me, Federal Government! I think ecfunj1 should get more money.\" However, not wanting to go to jail, I devise a way around this ridiculous statute. Instead of giving you more money, I pay for your healthcare, which gets around the wage controls set by the government and compensates you more for your labor. Other ways I find to get around this law are paid sick and vacation days. Basically, the reason there is a strong tradition of employer-based healthcare in the United States stems from 1940s government-mandated price and wage controls. Employers who competed in hiring workers in a scarce labor market were unable to pay more money to attract more/better workers. Employers resorted to offering perks, such as health insurance and paid sick/vacation days, to compensate workers more without breaking the law by paying them more. Additionally, there are special tax-deductions in the Tax Code for employer-paid healthcare. Employers are able to reduce their tax burden by providing health insurance to employees, and employees do not report health insurance paid by their employer as income. These special tax privileges reinforced the employer-based health insurance structure that came into existence in the 1940s. Edit: Here's more reading for the economically-curious:  URL_0 "}]}

Artists often *reference* files from other artists into their scene, so changes that one artist makes will automatically be reflected in their scene.

If you drive a stick down in the ground and attach a string on it, that string will run in a straight line if you pull it hard and attach it to another stick. Primitive but damn efficient. Ever seen one of those instruments on a tripod that are manned all the time that are accompanied by someone else with a long stick that walks around a lot. The optical instrument is, among other things, a very exact scope with a crosshair. The stick is a ruler with easy-to-see markings. In the scope is also an optical reading that gives the distance to the stick (remember how I said that the stick has reading that are easy to see? They only are if you focus properly with the scope) so now you also know the distance between the scope and the points. Compare two points and write down the markings on the stick and you know the height of three points (including the one you are standing on with the scope) and while you are at it the tripod also tells you the direction you point it, which gives that you know the angle between the points. You have effectively given yourself enough knowledge to calculate distance and establish if the height difference between the points is the preferred one. You can do the exact thing with more precise laser equipment and you can use positioning satellites and a very exact receiver. The entire road will be built with a lot of reference points. Someone walks around a lot with an instrument and writes things like +5, -2, 0 (which translates to add five, remove two or keep) on the ground at regular intervals so that he machine operators can see where to add some dirt and where to shave some off. If you want to make it more advanced you set up a reference radio beacon that all the machinery listen to and combine with gps positioning, and run all of the reference points as data lists where the machine helps you and gives you a constant reading on a display in front of you. Costs a lot, but the machine operator can do his job better if he had less guesswork. EDIT: ...if you attach it to another STICK."}]}

It hasn't experienced any nation-scale natural disasters basically ever. Sure, almost the entire American South has been affected by a major hurricane at some point over the last century, but *never all of it at once*. Same goes for things like earthquakes, fires, whatever. The AD 1755 Lisbon earthquake pretty much leveled that city. It was rebuilt, and the Kingdom of Portugal survived. But Lisbon was the *only* city of any real size in the country, so the economic effects on that country were far more drastic than, say, the Great Chicago Fire (AD 1871) or AD 1906 San Francisco earthquake were on the US economy. Both of those evens pretty much leveled their respective cities, just like the Lisbon earthquake did there.

After that, you\u2019ll be fine as long as you\u2019re placed back in a pressurized environment within about 90-180 seconds. These numbers are based on both human accidents that have occurred and on experiments run on animals. For instance, in 1965, researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas ran a series of experiments on dogs. They exposed the dogs to 1/380th normal atmospheric pressure for varying amounts of time to see how the animals\u2019 bodies would react. In most cases, the dogs survived without permanent damage, so long as the time frame was less than 90 seconds. Once they pushed it to two minutes, the dogs typically suffered cardiac arrest and died. So that\u2019s dogs. **What about humans**? Chimpanzees were chosen here as the guinea pigs. They did much better than the dogs, with most able to survive for up to 3 minutes, with the record being 3 and a half minutes. For those under 3 minutes, they not only were fine, but the researchers were able to confirm that their cognitive abilities, with one exception, were not damaged in any way. We don\u2019t just need to rely on animal tests though. One of the first such accidents was when a technician at the Johnson Space Center in 1965 accidentally depressurized his suit by ripping out a hose. He remained conscious for 14 seconds. During this time, he remembered feeling the water rapidly evaporating off his tongue. Around the 15 second mark other technicians started the process of re-pressurizing the chamber. He regained consciousness at around the 15,000 ft. atmospheric pressure level, which was about 27 seconds into the ordeal. The only residual effect noted was that he couldn\u2019t taste anything for several days after the accident, though his sense of taste returned to normal within a week. On the other end of the spectrum we have an incident involving a man who wasn\u2019t so lucky. According to a paper by Dr. Emanuel M. Roth, Rapid Decompression Emergencies in Pressure-Suited Subject, published in 1968, it took about 3 minutes to re-pressurize the chamber the man was in. Once it was re-pressurized, he gasped a few times, then ceased to breathe. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.

Stock is basically, well the stake of a company, broken up into tiny tiny pieces and put on the public market. Usually a board of directors own enough shares to control the company while the shares that go out on the market are called publicly traded shares. Say for example, you are a cannibal recipe website called Facecook and you as a private company have grown in popularity. You now need an injection of money to go to the next level and you don't want some huge investment firm controlling so much they could replace you. You break up your company's ownership into tiny shares, keep a majority for yourself, pass on some smaller amounts to your board of directors and your employees and the rest goes on the market. You set a reasonable valuation for it on the day it goes public, called the IPO or initial public offering. People all want a piece of the action, because they know if you do well, the stock value goes up (including that face cook stock you bought). Stock price goes up as demand goes up, or if there's rumors of something awesome you're doing. But in all honesty, most people on the public market are there as hawkers at a bazaar. Their aim is to buy at low prices and sell at high prices. The amount they get to own of your company is so little, they have little to no say in what your company does as an individual. But as a collective, every time there's Frenzy to buy, they drive your stock price up and inject capital into your company.

When they scream sell sell sell, they want people to dump the stock because there's reason to believe it will drop. Once it bottoms out. They'll buy it again and sell it once it rises.

So it's possible if someone created the purest chemical THC extract in the world and then *injected* over an oz of it they would die, but you'd definitely die from just filling your blood with an oz of an oily non-blood chemical just for mechanical reasons. Very few chemicals have this property of being able to be consumed em masse with no issue because many chemicals have a job to do in the body and too much of this effect will cause an over/under activation of that process that leads to death. A body is essentially a sack of chemical processes that consume, convert and use chemicals to maintain what is called \"homeostasis\". It in only in homeostasis, a state where all processes compliment each other to keeping the system working, that you can be healthy. One of the few other chemicals you can take in en masse is B12 which you can drink by the glass and just pee funny colors. It's LD50 is the order of grams (1000mg) per kg making it very hard to reach those levels. The reason why is biology and luck really; it just doesn't cause trouble. Most chemicals in high doses will disrupt some bodily process you need to keep living either by increasing, stopping it, etc., and in high enough concentrations you die. Sometimes they just do their job too well, or they mimic other important chemicals but they don't do the job at all, or other times the chemical itself is simply destructive to your body directly. B12 is a simple chemical that does not mimic (is not shaped like) other important bodily chemicals, so it does not disrupt processes normally kept in homeostasis by those chemicals being present by replacing them (which is what THC does actually, but non-harmfully). It doesn't produce harmful oxidation or release lots of free radicals that can cause tissue and DNA damage when it's metabolized. Whats more the metabolites produced when B12 is metabolized do not harm you either. In high concentrations it doesn't destabilize blood serum levels like water or salt does and make it impossible for your cells to respirate or get nutrients. It just hangs out, being B12, waiting to be used or sent to the bladder. Why? Well your body likes B12, it needs it, so if you couldn't take in B12 without it screwing up everything we wouldn't use it. But lots of (most) chemicals we need will kill us in high concentrations because of the above. If a chemical's job is keeping your body producing a certain hormone or regulating sodium channels in your nerves this can be super important and changing it can kill you. THC fits in a receptor for another naturally occurring brain chemical called a canabanoid (named after cannabis even though it is natural in the brain) and changes your perception, and few other things. It can change your perception *a lot*, but in the end a change in perception won't kill you unless you fall asleep somewhere you shouldn't. So it's a combination being similar to something that occurs naturally in the brain, and won't kill you in high concentrations because the chemical it's mimicking won't either. Also, we're just lucky nothing else about the chemical makeup of THC happens to kill us in high doses from to the hundreds of other ways chemicals can cause you to die. TL;DR Luck mostly."}]}

But they were TRYING to teach you about subtractive colors (even if they didn't use that word). This applies to dyes. You take a surface which reflects white light and you add dyes that **subtract** from the colors that surface reflects. If you have Magenta dye (not red) it subtracts Cyan (not blue) and Yellow. If you have Cyan it subtracts Magenta and Yellow. If you haveYellow it subtracts Cyan and Magenta. So subtractive color is based on Cyan/Magenta/Yellow Additive color is what your high school physics class was talking about. Additive color is what happens when you add LIGHT to something. If you have no light and you add red light you get red. If you have no light and you add blue light you get blue, if you have no light and you add green light you get green. Additive color is based on Red/Green/Blue They are different color systems. Subtractive is for dyes and paints (because it changes the reflective surface, not the light, which is white). Additive is for light."}]}

Kelvin is an absolute scale, there is no negative (in the sense of being colder than 0). 0 Kelvin is the absence of heat. (Note, I'm doing some handwaving here, there actually systems that can have a negative kelvin temperature, but these are actually *hotter* than any system with a positive temperature. They are not negative in the sense of being 'colder'.) Part of the confusion of why we can't 'go lower' probably arises from Celsius and Farenheit, which are not absolute scales. Their zero point is arbitrary, and doesn't correspond to some 'minimum.' Hence, going below zero is not a problem for them. The thing to realize however, is that even negative x Farenheit or Negative Y Celsius still has heat present. It's only negative in the sense that *it is below where we decided to put the zero.* The same is not true in Kelvins. 0 is when all of the heat is gone. You can't remove more heat than all of the heat."}]}

Like it's binary- either you don't modify, or you do. It is so much more nuanced than that. There is an extremely wide range of ways to modify food. Some of those practices are just fine, and some aren't. Yet, all the actions of genetic modification are clumped together. People get very defensive one way or the other when your bring it up. GMOS ARE OK!!! GMOS ARE HORRIBLE!! It all depends. Some are amazing, and in the future, could massively expand in a very incredible way, and the misconceptions could easily get in the way of that beneficial expansion. But the other side is that some of these GMO practices are really not good, at all. Monsanto, employs both positive and negative practices. The negative is the cycle they have put themselves into with pesticides. Continually modifying the seed to withstand more and more bombardment from what is essentially a nerve agent. Insects have short lives, and thus many generation in a short time. They adapt to the new pesticide levels, so they blast more on. Whoops, they adapted again, let's spray more! Whoops, it's damaging the plant. Let's modify the plant to take it! Whoops, the bugs adapted again. More pesticides it is! Whoops.... on and on. This is their 'solution.' And this is, very fairly IMO, part of the root of the mistrust for GMOS. And that's not good. Modifying food is something we've done for a long time and we're on the edge of really expanding it in wonderful ways. Synthetic meat, for example, could really be amazing . But with the current trust level, it will be hard for it to be adapted when it's ready to go. Some of the mistrust is earned, and some of it isn't. One thing is for sure though- this 'one way or the other' thinking has got to go, as do these endless cycles that companies like Monsanto perpetuate."}]}

This is nonsense. It's pretty much just propaganda, chosen to make it look like Anonymous is legion, and also because it just sounds cool. I'd say you are Anonymous if you fulfill two criteria. 1. You understand--to some unspecified amount--what Anonymous *is*. 2. You *identify* as part of Anonymous. 1\\. makes it so my mom--who can't even use a computer nor understand the history of Anonymous or even what they stand for--can't call herself Anonymous just because she saw a brief newsreport on them and their support for OWS.

{"id": "5t0r10", "input": "How pizza delivery became a thing, when no other restaurants really offered hot food deliveries like that.", "output": [{"answer": "Three factors: the nature of pizza production, the physical and financial infrastructure available for that production in the United States after World War II, and the portable nature of pizza itself. First, production: a pizza parlor needs only two pieces of specialized equipment, a heavy stand mixer for the dough and an oven that will hold temperatures over 700F. If you are handy, you can build the oven yourself with brick and pipe. So long as you aren't trying to open a full-service restaurant with lots of seating and a varied menu, the only expensive piece of equipment you have to acquire is that stand mixer. Second, infrastructure: after World War II, the US government had a lot of surplus items they were selling cheap: jeeps, canteens, army boots,... and huge Hobart stand mixers. The Hobart mixers were big enough to mix a battalion's bread, and they were going cheap. A veteran could get a small business loan from the GI bill, buy his mixer, rent a small storefront, build his oven, and boom, he was in the restaurant business. It's a restaurant that can make a lot of pizza efficiently, but it can't make much else. You aren't going to get a lot of sit-down trade. People want to take what you make to eat someplace else. This brings us to the third item: pizza is a perfectly portable food. It doesn't need a knife and fork. It can be reheated multiple times without a discernable loss in quality. By varying the toppings of vegetables and meat, it can easily be a single-dish meal that makes the entire family happy. As pizza parlors spread from urban centers, owners realized there was a limit to the walk-in traffic they could expect. They knew from their urban experience many customers were taking the pizza home. How could they replicate that trade in the suburbs? By offering a new service: pizza delivered to the customer's house. Edit: something I forgot, which added steam to the spread of pizza delivery in the 1950's, particularly in the midwest: narcotics. Suppose you are an Italian organized crime boss in Chicago or Kansas City and you want to distribute narcotics in Lincoln, Nebraska. You can't just send a couple of Sicilian nephews to hang out on a street corner. Two Italian guys just stopping to buy gas in Lincoln would attract attention in the 1950's. People would notice. If the same two guys open a pizza parlor, however, no one cares. They can hire compromised people down on their luck as delivery men. They will learn soon enough who can move and consume their product. They have the perfect cover business: all cash, deliveries going all over the city, and open late. I don't know how much this happened in the East, and I don't think it happened at all out West, but I know this happened around KC and Chicago a lot."}]}

{"id": "5x51wd", "input": "Why do Britain and other English empire countries still bow to monarchs? What real purpose does the queen serve?", "output": [{"answer": "The monarch is head of state, as opposed to head of government (that would be the Prime Minister); in European republics, the monarch is usually replaced by a President, who may have more definite powers and is either directly or indirectly elected. The head of state basically represents the country, while the head of government sets the broad agenda for the legislature and also chairs the cabinet. The US President effectively combines the roles of head of state and head of government, which is sometimes problematic in terms of diplomacy: a recent petition (signed by 1.8 million people) called on the government not to accord President Trump the honour of a full state visit due to controversies surrounding his conduct as head of government. In the last few centuries, the role of monarch has declined, and since Victoria has kept out of party politics altogether -- in public, that is. In private, she has regular audiences with the Prime Minister in which they talk of matters of state. In theory, the most important role the British monarch has is to ensure good governance, but it's unclear how much she can actually do to that end. It's also unclear just how much influence she does have on government policy, since the details of her meetings with the PM are confidential. It is known that Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, once complained that if the queen could vote, she would vote Liberal Democrat. The murky nature of her exact role, given that she is unelected and accountable only to constitutional law (whatever that may be on a given day), obviously makes a lot of people nervous. On the other hand, given her very long reign (her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill), her experience may well be extremely useful. Diplomatically, she performs a role that is arguably very important. As head of state, she meets other heads of states, and that certainly helps to oil the complex machinery of international relations. It may be helpful that, since she is a hereditary monarch, she doesn't have to toe the party line or keep one eye on her approval ratings."}]}

(Source Mary woods Thomas Jefferson and uva) Essentially, the multiplicity of buildings and the quad and gardens are more pleasant to hang out in and more conducive to learning. Also, a second reason, a \"university\" is a collection of \"colleges\". Colleges are specific schools within a larger institution. (Which is why they often have separate names, ie MIT is a university with a \" Sloane school of management \" within, or within \"Harvard university\" there is \"Harvard college\" and \"harvard business school\" and \"Harvard medical school\") Essentially each college is a small self-contained school with its own dean, its own funding, and it's own admissions, etc etc. Therefore, although the university is large, each individual school is not sufficiently large enough to have a tower. Finally, horizontal buildings are easier to enlarge as that part of the school expands.

{"id": "4tvyy2", "input": "Drinking or taking drugs \"to feel normal\".", "output": [{"answer": "In truth, people who say that \"taking drugs makes them feel normal\" say this because when they take a particular drug, the way the drug makes them feel, or the effect of the drug, makes them feel how they perceive others who are \"normal\" must feel. For example, \"normal\" people, one might postulate, do not have a constant distraction of a million painful-thoughts running through their heads all the time. On the other hand, there ARE people, who DO suffer with non-stop thoughts: rapid, relentless, repetitive, ruminating thoughts that parce their neurons all day every day. If when a person take a drug, that drug's effect reduces the non-stop, relentless, ruminating thoughts, that person could then suppose, that how they feel while under the \"influence\" of the drug, is how \"normal\" people must feel all the time. If one were to say that \"drugs\" makes them feel normal, they could be articulating that \"drugs\" (take away the relentless, ruminating thoughts) and make them feel \"normal\", and/ or how others must feel without the indications of relentless ruminating thoughts. You can apply this formula  &  that \"perception of normal\" statement to one of many hundreds of conditions that those who suffer from alcohol and drug addiction seek remission from. Some people seek relief without even understanding why they they do what they do. Achieving relief from a symptom that \"normal\" people do not usually suffer from, is the most logical and the most basic explanation of such a statement. When one states that drugs make them feel normal\" is does not suggest that how they may be \"explaining\" their particular condition is any \"less real\" or a \"bad sign\" because it is the only way they know how to verbalize their experience. Suggestions to the contrary, that all \"addicts\" or people who take \"drugs\" are seeking to achieve anything other than relief from a particular malady, demonstrates a lack of understanding of the disease of addiction and further perpetuates the myths and stigmas associated with mental illness."}]}
{"id": "2xw1bq", "input": "How to appreciate abstract modern art.", "output": [{"answer": "For this explanation I'll stick with painting, though it applies to art in general. There's two main things you look at when viewing a painting. It's \"form\" and its \"content.\" Form describes the physical stuff about a painting: color, size, what type of paint, thickness of paint, type of canvas, type of brush strokes, and so on. Content describes what the painting is depicting: a house, a person, a group of people, a particular event, a collection of objects, whatever. We'll look at two paintings, one \"normal\" painting and then an abstract one. First up is [Leutze's painting of Washington crossing the Deleware.]( URL_0 ) What are its formal qualities? Well, it's really big, 21 feet long. It's painted in oil paint using brush strokes that aren't really visible unless you're right up close. The colors are natural and a little muted. It's a horizontal rectangle. It's probably very heavy. And I assume it's made out of wood and canvas. Other than the size, there's not much going on as far as form goes. But as far as content is concerned, well... I'll just link you to the [wikipedia article.]( URL_1 ) There's a whole story being told in the piece. There's men in boats, there's a great general, there's an icy river and terrified horses. There's content out the wazoo. **This is the point of most \"normal\" painting**:to depict something, and do it in such a way that the viewer isn't really worried about the how it's painted or the formal elements. It's like when you watch TV, you don't think about all the transistors and LEDs that make the thing function, you just watch your show. Now on to the abstract piece, [Jackson Pollok's Autumn Rhythm No. 30.]( URL_2 ) Where \"normal\" painting is all about content, abstract painting is all about form. This painting is 17 feet long. The paint is thick and applied with a crazy dripping, splattering technique. The canvas is left bare in many places; you can see what its made out of. As far as content goes, there is literally none. The entire point of this painting is the form, how the paint is applied to the canvas. In the absence of any kind of content the viewer is left to simply react to the painting however they'd like. There are no politics in Autumn Rhythm, no story, no reclining nudes, no faces--no content. Going back to the TV metephor: It'd be like if somebody broke your TV down into it's individual components and spread them out on the floor. It's no longer about what it's displaying, it's about what makes the TV work, and what it's made of. Why is abstract art important? Because it's progressive. Since the beginning of civilization most, if not all art was representational. Cavemen painted pictures of mammoth hunts and fertility goddesses on their cave walls, and up until very recently all that anyone in history could really do was paint that hunt a little more realistically. In the twentieth century (arguably a little bit earlier) artists deliberately moved away from representational art and simply tried to capture their feeling of a time and a place. This acceptance of emotion by itself, not attached to any concrete meaning is the essence of the abstract, and reflects a growth in the consciousness of humanity as a species. We're no longer just goofballs staring at the TV, watching whatever is on. We've taken it apart and now we're learning about electricity and transistors and LEDs and wires and the specifics of what makes the whole thing work. So to answer your question: you should appreciate abstract art because of it's formal qualities. Look at the brush strokes. Look at the colors. Look at the size and shape of the work. Ask yourself why the artist made the decisions they made. Think about the feeling the artist was trying to communicate. Think about your own feelings while you look at an abstract piece of work. Is it uplifting? Depressing?Energizing? Chaotic? Orderly? And you should appreciate abstract art because of what it means as a milestone in the grand endevor of human expression. I should add that little reproductions of these works on your computer screen don't compare to the seeing the real deal. **Go out and see art.** edit: formatting"}]}

That's also the reason why you don't feel the force of the earth rotating on its axis, or revolving around the sun at 30 km/second. What creates a force is a *change* in speed, which is what acceleration is. Picture yourself in a stopped car. You're going 0 miles an hour. Do you feel any forces? Not really, you're sitting still, things are good. Now imagine you slam on the gas pedal, going up to 60 mph. Now you feel a *force* because your speed is changing - your body is pressed backwards against the seat by that force. Now you hit 60 and you ease off the gas, maintaining a nice freeway speed. Do you feel any force while you're on the freeway? No, you feel just about the same as you did parked - if you opened a window you could feel the air moving, but inside of your car, everything is just the same as if you were going 0. Except now, slam on the brakes. You're decelerating and changing speed - a force pushes you forward, straining against the seatbelt. Once you hit 0, that force is gone. An airplane works the same way - you accelerate up to 600 mph slowly, so that the force isn't too overwhelming, but once you hit that speed and stop accelerating, it feels just the same as being still on the ground. Aside from any bumps or turbulence, which (just like in a car) change your acceleration by a little bit and affect you as forces."}]}

These words are buzzwords for fad diets that make them sound more scientific when they are not. There are certain chemicals that can inhibit your body's ability to process nutrients, but few of these are significant or harmful in any way, and lots of them have helpful effects themselves. Almost anything you eat can be toxic in the right quantities (like water!) and most of the \"harmful\" elements in food are processed away by your liver and kidneys. Apple seeds are a good example - they actually contain a tiny amount of a chemical called amygdalin, which can convert into cyanide when eaten. Cyanide is a very deadly poison to humans, but the quantity in a few apple seeds isn't enough to harm you - you'd have to eat a few cups worth of seeds to cause any damage, and that's never going to happen if you're eating a couple of apples a day. But nobody would say that apples contain \"toxins.\" Paleo is a fad diet with no real scientific backing that spreads because people latch on to pseudo-scientific buzz words like \"natural\" or \"toxin.\" Now that doesn't mean that paleo diets are necessarily bad - I actually cook pretty close to it at home (mostly seafood, meats, veggies, fruits, and pretty few grains or carbs).

Its done, more or less, by taking away a representative portion of a colony and, giving it a new queen and then poof, new hive. In reality its a lot more difficult than that and it sometimes doesn't work very well but depending on your breed of bees and their hardiness, beekeepers can split tons of new hives. The upper limits is of course how fast the hives can build up for another splitting which can take time (remember the queen is only laying one eggs at a time). There are obvious downsides to this mitigating strategy, a big one being a lack of genetic diversity. Colony collapse disorder is on the mend right now and populations are recovering. That is due in part to new understanding about some pesticides such as neonicotinoids which are suspects of playing a part in the colony collapse disorder phenomenon.  URL_0 "}]}

The same reason why anyone gains weight when they are in a high-stress job that requires a lot of travel. It's a stressful job with intense hours during production periods, and it gets really easy to neglect exercise and just eat crappy foods, especially because you usually celebrate after performances with your friends/colleagues/family. You often don't get a lot of sleep, and that can also mess with your overall health. As far as actual singing goes, there's actually no evidence that being overweight makes your voice bigger, lets you sing louder/over an orchestra, or anything like that at all. If anything, vocal scientists are finding that being in better physical shape actually IMPROVES vocal stamina and quality, just as being in shape improves performance in any physical activity. HOWEVER, being fat has some \"advantages\" when learning to sing classically. Some of the most common phrases to singers is that they need \"to be grounded,\" \"sing from their diaphragm\", \"have low-breath,\" etc. When you're carrying around a lot of extra belly weight, you have a constant tugging-down feeling. You have extra weight physically pulling the breath mechanism downwards. It can help in learning to sing. Also, until recently, it didn't matter if you were fat and unhealthy. If you had a god-like voice, you could look however you want and still perform and get good work. Opera used to be (and, IMO, SHOULD still be) about the voice and music over anything else. Now that there is a big push for opera singers to LOOK like the roles they play (nobody wants to see a 300 lb Juliet anymore), many professional singers have taken to losing weight in unhealthy, crash diets. They lose weight so quickly, they are unable to feel the changes that happen in their body and take time to make proper adjustments. They no longer feel \"grounded\" because they don't have the weight actually \"grounding\" them. So their technique suffers, their voice gets \"lighter\", they have an existential crisis, say they can only sing when at a certain weight, and eat themselves into oblivion again. Those who lose weight responsibly and healthily rarely, if ever, have any problems singing. **TL;DR It's a big, mental game. Some singers think they can only sing at a certain weight and size, and actively try to stay large.**"}]}

The yellow colors mean that the air is more dense while the pink colors mean that it is less dense. The more dense the air is, the colder it is. You can also tell from that picture which way the wind is blowing overall in the atmosphere. It blows along those black lines and from west to east. As you can see the wind goes strongly from north to south in the west and carries cold air with it. Then it goes from south to north, doing the opposite. On top of this, there is a cycle that happens to the water in the Pacific Ocean between South America and Indonesia called ENSO. Sometimes, the surface water is warmer in the west and sometimes further east. Right now the warm water is further east towards South America. This cycle effects the weather around the world, as shown by [this picture]( URL_0 ). As you can see, it makes the NE warmer than usual and makes the south a bit wetter (e.g. snowier).

It has been nearly 6 years since I returned to the United States from Brazil. When I first got to Brazil, I didn't know any Portuguese. I studied a ton, practiced daily, and was immersed in their culture. I rarely had the time or opportunity to speak in English. It was more or less a sink or swim situation, and was very difficult at first. I would have to think in my head what I wanted to say, try to compute whether or not I had the vocabulary to do it, then modify what I wanted to say based on my Portuguese vocabulary, and then translate my English thoughts as they traveled from my mind to my mouth. It was often a very slow and surprisingly exhausting thing to do all day. Over the course of several months, certain phrases, words, and ideas that I expressed often would begin to flow more easily. The time it took for me to translate and speak my English thoughts in Portuguese became easier and quicker. I'd say that around 5-7 months I was pretty good at being able to communicate almost any idea I had in Portuguese, although my grammar, accent, and vocabulary very clearly indicated I still had lots to learn. Throughout this time and process, there is no clear, \"ah ha!\" moment when you wake up and realize, \"I can speak and think fluently in Portuguese!\" It's so gradual that you don't really notice it, and I cannot clearly pinpoint a time when I can say I \"became fluent\" and could \"think in Portuguese\" from that point on. The process was too gradual. Through this learning process, even from early on, there would be times when I would \"think in Portuguese\" naturally, even if it was in small phrases or sentences, or even single words. My brain would just think that way without me thinking about it. I would sometimes realize, \"Hey! I just had that tiny thought in Portuguese!\" The more fluent I became, the more frequent and fluid the Portugese thoughts were. It was often a mix of the two through this learning period. After a year or more in Brazil, I would converse so well and so often that my entire day would be spent thinking in Portuguese. I knew the language, it was how I spoke, and it was what I read. When thinking, English words would naturally fill in the gaps sometimes when I didn't know the word in Portuguese. The more I learned, the less my brain would plug in English. My mind would naturally shift to English if I were placed in a situation where I was presented with English, usually when reading or speaking with other English speakers. As soon as those activities were done, my mind would naturally revert to thinking in Portuguese. The same goes for me and English now. Although my Portuguese has deteriorated from lack of practice, my mind will quickly begin thinking in Portuguese when I read or watch a movie in Portuguese. My mind will keep thinking that way for a bit afterwards (like 10-40 minutes), but will then quickly revert to English since that's what I'm surrounded by in the U.S."}]}

{"id": "57l4ga", "input": "Is intelligence genetic? Are some people genetically predisposed to be better at things like math and arts?", "output": [{"answer": "I used to work in a lab that did learning, memory,  &  intelligence research. Ultimately, in humans, **approximately 50% of your mental capacity is determined by your level of general intelligence**, according to well-founded statistical analyses. Let me explain: **\"General intelligence\"** Intelligence is hard to define, but we do have some concrete evidence for what it is. The most important piece of evidence that there is such a thing as \"general intelligence\" is the fact that pretty much all types of mental abilities are correlated with each other. In other words, people who are really good at math tend *on average* to be really good at a lot of other things. This strongly implies that there is some kind of \"general factor\" that people can have more or less of. One very important thing to note is that \"general intelligence\" doesn't really directly give someone math skills, or computer programming skills, etcetera. Instead, you should think of general intelligence as giving someone an increased ability to learn those things. Someone who scores higher on the \"general factor\" will be able to learn calculus more easily, in less time, than others. In practice, this often results in people who can't learn calculus as easily simply not learning calculus, and this can make it look like \"person A can understand calculus but person B can't.\" In reality, it's usually not a matter of being able / not able to understand something. It's simply a matter of it costing less time and effort for some than others. It's just sadly very easy for people to become discouraged by things like this and deciding that they are not able at all. **\"multiple kinds of intelligence\"** There are also lower-level \"group factors,\" which represent the fact that certain \"groups\" of mental abilities correlate with each other especially strongly. For example, spatial reasoning skills might be one type of group factor. Generally speaking, the different \"group factors\" tend to correlate with the \"general factor.\" Someone who is more intelligent will usually have good spatial reasoning skills, as well as good ability to learn math, ability to learn music, ability to learn computer skills, and so on. But the group factors can vary somewhat independently from the general factor. So somebody who had high general intelligence CAN have poor spatial reasoning skills. Or someone with lower general intelligence CAN have high ability to learn math, or ability to learn languages, and so on. **Genetics** Studies on twins have helped demonstrate that there is a strong genetic component to intelligence. For example, some studies compare identical and non-identical twins. This makes a great control, because in either case the twins are born at the same time and raised in the same environment. But identical twins share all of their genes, whereas non-identical twins have approximately 50% of the same genes. So, if you give IQ tests to a bunch of twins, then if intelligence is highly genetic, identical twins should be more similar to each other than fraternal twins. But if intelligence is purely due to upbringing, socioeconomic status, etc., then fraternal twins should be just as similar to each other as identical twins. In fact, such studies have found that identical twins usually have similar IQ, and fraternal twins have IQs that are less closely matched. As far as we can tell, something like 50% of IQ (and a true IQ test is a pretty decent measure of general intelligence) is genetic. I am not aware of studies specifically addressing the genetic component of group factors. So I'm not sure how likely it is for a specific talent in one area to be heritable."}]}

So, hypertension also known as high blood pressure can be thought of like this. You have this vast network of highways in your body: interstates (large vessels), highways (medium vessels), and city roads (small vessels). The cars on this highway system (red and white blood cells, platelets, various proteins, and so on) all ride this highway system in a vary harmonious way (not many asshats on the road). There is also space in between the cars (water) that has to be accounted for. For the most part, things stay well balanced, if there are potholes (a leaky vessel), it is repaired quickly with a quick patch (platelet plug), and slight fender benders are repaired without ever showing signs of a problem. High blood pressure can be seen as all the roads, highways, and interstates getting smaller, or the amount of space being taken up on the road is getting larger. You have to adjust one, or both, in order to fix the larger problem of the congested traffic. By bleeding out you can reduce the number cars on the road and the space that was in between each car to help alleviate the strain on the highway system, but those cars are necessary to bring home all the bacon (oxygen) to all corners of the nation (the tissues of your body). Your body will just call for more taxes (increase in bone marrow production and collection of free water through the gut and kidney) to produce more cars and fix the space between each car and the problem starts all over again. You gotta either pass legislation to either expand the road systems (as one type of hypertensive pill = ACE inhibitor) or decrease the space between each car (another hypertensive pill = diuretic [causes you to pee more to get rid of some water]). Some times is a combination of both; a bipartisan bill so to speak. Hope this helps. Fun fact though: approximately 90% of the cases of hypertension have no known cause."}]}

As we evolved, got bigger, and brains started to develop, it became easier to compete for resources with other daytime animals. Before being out during the day meant certain death: predatory birds, lions, bears, etc..... as we got bigger, became easier to move and be active in daytime (way harder for an eagle to pick up a chimp than a mouse lemur). Why is being diurnal more beneficial? Think hunting, fishing, social groups, etc. being able to see and move in the day makes all of these more \"evolved\" activities possible. Most nocturnal animals (esp nocturnal primates) are solitary foragers, very small, etc. Why is size beneficial? Because of metabolic rate. Bigger animals have more efficient metabolism, can digest food more easily. Why did apes evolve to be bigger while there are some still nocturnal prosimians? This question stumps a lot of evolutionary biologists, but the idea is that some prosimians 50 million years ago (or whatever timeline) were in better positions for resources with less competition and were able to \"become\" larger/diurnal.

There are many benefits to shopping local. 1. Your money stays in your community. This happens on many levels. First, you are directly supporting the shop owner and their family as opposed to your dollars going to increase the bottom line for a bunch of stock holders that are probably already extremely wealthy. Those dollars are typically spent locally and used for things like their children's sports, piano lessons, etc. Secondly, most local businesses are active members of the community. My business donates thousands of dollars to local non-profit organizations that serve people in our community. If I (and other local businesses) weren't there, they would most likely have to cut programs or go under. Lastly, most small shops support local manufacturing, cottage businesses, and US made products. For example, I carry multiple handcrafted lines in my store that are local home based businesses. These small businesses would not have an avenue to get into a retail location if a small shop like mine was not around. A mom and pop botanical business is not getting on the shelf at Target, let's be real. 2. By supporting local business, you create diversity and choice in your community. You can see this by shopping around, if you want to purchase something unique from a brick and mortar location... you aren't going to find it at Walmart. Big box stores have a very bland selection, and are typically products that can be found anywhere. Want something truly unique? Visit a local boutique. 3. You are most likely going to get a high quality product. The small business owner knows that everything they sell in their shop reflects on them personally. Carrying crap on your shelf will result in nothing but problems. Big box stores and Amazon however, couldn't give two shits if you end up with some p.o.s. from China.

Public officials and public figures alike have a massive hand in shaping public opinion, spurring talk and debate, and forwarding public interest whether we recognize it or not (nobody LIKES those tabloids, but how many are sold a day?). As well as this, and established in another court case (Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc.): \"Public officials and public figures usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements than private individuals normally enjoy. Private individuals are therefore more vulnerable to injury, and the state interest in protecting them is correspondingly greater...\" Basically outlining the idea that, not only do public figures spur debate and provide for society's best interests, but they also have a more-than-normal power to deflect or otherwise change the news or debate that disfavors them through the use of money and status, and therefore the state focuses more resources on protecting your rights than theirs."}]}

If we knew why we can't, we'd probably know why we can. (Imagine asking preflight engineers why we can't fly or preantibiotic doctors why we can't cure infection) Firstly, some incorrect answers in the thread can lead us to an OK answer. That laser business is completely useless in my opinion. But the mechanism will explain why we can't do the same for enamel. Those lasers work by chemically treating and then stimulating odontoblasts (cells which create dentine, the second layer of the tooth, enamels softer little brother) to create dentine. I won't go too far into why the only reason those lasers are gaining traction is because they're lasers, but long story short is you need vital, sterile, exposed pulp tissue, which really is only found in the case of trauma. But we already know how to stimulate dentine in such situations - CaOH or MTA. Anyone interested in why this 'breakthrough' is literally nothing but a waste of money for both clinician and patient, please Google 'Cvek Pulpotomy'. We have been doing this for decades. Now, onto the question - why can't we do that with enamel? Consider how teeth are formed. An ELIcloserto5 version, is teeth are made of 3 layers like a cake. The crisp, hard, protective, water tight icing (enamel), the softer, porous, shock absorbing sponge cake (dentine), and the gelatinous jam (blood) and cream (nerve) inner filling. The critical part here, is how the icing and sponge are formed. The icing creating cells (ameloblasts) and the sponge creating cells (odontoblasts) start touching each other. Then, step by step, nanometer by nanometer, they move away from eachother, laying down icing and sponge cake as they go. The sponge cake cells move towards the jam and cream fillig, and when they are done they live in the filling, laying down sponge when stimulated for the life of the tooth.The icing cells move away from the jam cream filling, to the harsh outside world. Eventually, when the cake leaves the oven, the icing creating cells are lost. Now, the world is harsh. The outside world is full of flies and general trauma, which will wear the icing down and lose sugar (minerals from hydroxapatite - calcium and phosphate, although fluoride can go back in as an even better/harder mineral, though not naturally present). With good diligence shooing the flies away (brushing/flossing) and regular reintroduction of lost sugar (toothpaste/fluoride/that gum someone mentioned) we can replace the lost sugar. However, sugar isn't icing - some specialised cells laid down the sugar in a very particular way. As long as not to much sugar is lost and no big chunks are missing, just dusting it with sugar will work, as the exisitng icing holds enough of the pattern that there's only one way for the dusted sugar to go - the right way. We know what's in the icing - we have the recipe. But we can't lay it down with the same style and pattern the cells did. And the cells are lost. There's no stimulating them like the sponge cells. Once the icing is gone, it's gone. Edit: the comments in this thread are a testament to what I'm saying about lasers. People are almost satirical in their irrational affinity towards the study, simply because \"lasers\"."}]}

Melatonin is dependent upon the light and dark rhythms around your body. When it is nighttime and the light around you begins to disappear, your body begins to produce melatonin which is a signal to your brain that it is time to sleep. The darker it is, the more melatonin your body will produce. Once it lightens again, your body stops producing melatonin and it signals your brain again that it is time to awaken.

If you're a deer and get eaten by a wolf, you've probably lived your life with a lot of freedom but just died pretty brutally. If you're a chicken and get eaten by a human, your life was very likely spent in a tiny environment with a huge amount of other chickens eating food laden with supplements to force more growth and so on. This is why many vegans will argue that being vegetarian isn't enough, a chicken that lays eggs or a cow that produces milk will have the same poor quality of life up until their death whether or not they get eaten at the end of it. While I'm a meat eater myself, I'm strongly of the belief that the debate needs to move on from \"are we ethically **eating** meat\" to \"are we ethically **farming** meat\"."}]}
{"id": "49pr8i", "input": "why does it take 30 mins for my dogs bloodwork to come back yet mine takes 24 hours?", "output": [{"answer": "It's marked up as explained, but just to add to this topic. The vast majority of blood work has a very short turn around time regardless of species. Time delays really only occur when samples have to be sent to a local laboratory for either confirmation or if the practice doesn't have the equipment to run the required test. As a couple examples a veterinary practice might have a biochemistry and a haematology analyser which will allow a vet or vet nurse to provide results within 5 minutes. These analysers are quite accurate and provide a decent snap shot typically of liver/kidney parameters along with a full blood count. These results will help a clinician to in the least start treatment, continue therapy, confirm health status. They may send the same samples on to a reference laboratory to confirm/get more detailed results. Typically a vet practice lab will have a few other smaller point of care analysers or tests that they can perform (haemoglobin, blood glucose, blood typing or simple snap ELISA). When sending a sample to a reference laboratory the samples will arrive by courier and/or local postal delivery. This obviously takes more time, but the larger laboratories endeavour to provide either same day or within 24 hours for the vast majority of samples/tests. The advantage of sending to a reference lab are specialised analysers with higher accuracy, wider range of available testing and the ability of having specialised areas (for example the company that I work for has recently developed tests for early kidney disease markers, has exclusive tests for pancreatic inflammation etc which are only available by testing at our reference laboratories). As for human testing (and this is more specific to the UK), when you have your bloods taken at your GP, they may have some simpler point of care testing machines (Blood glucose, haemoglobin, cholesterol etc) but they will be far less likely to have their own laboratory. These will be couriered to a laboratory (usually hospital based) and tested within an hour or two. The results are then transmitted (fax, email, or posted results) back to the GP surgery. Obviously if your bloods are taken at the hospital, then turn around of results will be massively reduced, but even they may have to send samples on to a specialised reference laboratory as it is generally not cost effective to provide every service under the sun if the sample numbers are low. If you'd like to know more about reference laboratories ask away. Source: Laboratory Scientist at a veterinary reference lab."}]}

Check out for instance the history of the Khyber pass:  >  Well known invasions of the area have been predominantly through the Khyber Pass, such as the invasions by Darius I, Genghis Khan and later Mongols such as Duwa, Qutlugh Khwaja and Kebek. Prior to the Kushan era, the Khyber Pass was not a widely used trade route.[1] Among the Muslim invasions of ancient India, the famous invaders coming through the Khyber Pass are Mahmud Ghaznavi, and the Afghan Muhammad Ghori and the Turkic-Mongols. (Ancient Canaan also served a similar function with the Egyptian Empire on one side and various Empires such as the Mittani, Hittites, Assyrians and Sumerians on the other side) More recently the British Empire tried to go in and do their thing (which they were copying from the Romans) of \"let's you and him fight\" AKA divide and conquer - but the Afghans were already heavily divided along tribal lines to start with so that went nowhere. Then when the pesky Russians invaded in the 80s 'Murica was in its 'Communism must not win at all costs' phase, so they funnelled massive amounts of cash, guns and sent in CIA agents to train the locals up in how to be terrorists. Yep, at one stage the Taliban and Al Quaeda were 'the good guys, fighting the good fight'. Remember kiddies: it's not being a state sponsor of terror if it's us doing it. *cough* Eventually the Russians ran out of money and willpower to stick their willies into that meat grinder and withdrew. So the region started to recover. And by recover I mean they started growing a lot of poppies. And by poppies I don't mean tulips. Drugs. Lots and lots of drugs (opium). So then, having won the war on Communism, 'Murica decided that they would start a series of wars against other abstractions - hence the war on drugs. (NB: the following is sourced from an article in Time magazine from back when Senator Obama was teasing thinking about running for the big chair) So 'Murica went to Afghanistan and said to the farmers 'drugs is bad, m'kay'. And the farmers said 'okay, we see your point, but what's our alternative?'. So then 'Murica promised them that if they stopped growing poppies 'Murica would give them heaps of aid to transition over to much less valuable crops (peas and corn and beans and shit). And the Afghani farmers were like 'well, we'll make a lot less money but okay, we'll give it a go'. So they didn't plant poppies, and then 'Murica, having got what it wanted from the relationship, reneged on the deal to help the Afghani farmers transition to food crops. No food crops equals no food equals famine. So as you can imagine the 'Muricans were somewhat unpopular. (end bit sourced from Time magazine) Then some of the CIA trained ~~terrorists~~ ~~freedom fighters~~ terrorists got together with the Saudis and decided that a bunch of Saudis should hijack some planes and blow up some buildings in New York. In retaliation for the Saudis committing a terror attack on 'Murican soil the 'Muricans re-invaded Iraq, which had ostensibly been their ally in the region (but probably they weren't flavour of the month after Iraq asked permission to invade Kuwait and 'Murica said 'go ahead we DGAF' and then turned around and bombed Iraq back into the stone age) (NB see also Iran-Contra affair AKA 'selling guns to both sides' AKA 'lets you and him fight'). Then when everyone went 'Bwuh?' the 'Muricans said 'Oh yeah? Well we're going to invade Afghanistan and get those Al Quaeda mofos'. At which point everyone in Russia let out a hearty guffaw and said 'Yeah, good luck with that'. And the war in Iraq and Afghanistan sucked 2 Trillion dollars out of the 'Murican economy, which then went into a meltdown and there was a big housing crisis where the economy came up about 2 Trillion dollars short (funny that) and so the White House punished Wall Street by giving them a 30 billion dollar bailout ... and that year the Wall Street firms that had been bailed out paid out 30 billion dollars in bonuses to their top executives (funny that). TLDR: the short answer is famine, the long answer is that Afghanistan is a meat grinder, and every Empire on Earth has stepped up to jam their dick into it."}]}

Germans have it beat into them from a very early age that the Holocaust was horrible. That there is no excuse for what Hitler did. That you do not put country above being a human being. If am correct it took up the majority of their history lessons (this does not mean that they at unaware of the world). Secondly, TV here is forever running documentaries on the holocaust and WWII. I am pretty sure I have seen footage at least once a day. Third, I have never been in a place where people are so quick to defend a person being verbally or physically attacked by another person. On the train I have seen many altercations (verbal) that generally ends with the asshole being called out by at least two other people (sometimes the entire train car gets pissed). So they aren't generally ones to stand by and let that shit happen. That being said it has caused some issues. In Germany it is illegal to argue facts of the Holocaust in public. The official story has not changed in a long time even with new data and facts present. Historians can lose their jobs or be arrested for trying to argue on the side of truth. So, there is that. It has also made racism a very difficult thing to talk about. No one wants to talk about the fact that German citizens with Turkish parents are still treated like subcitizens ....but they are. Lastly, this does not mean that Germans don't have a sense of humor about Hitler. I would, however, suggest that if you crack a Hitler or Holocaust related joke that you know the person you are talking to very well and refrain from doing so in public. People are very vigilant when it comes to anything Nazi related. Graffiti is covered quickly after the police are contacted. Edit: to be clear Germans dislike Hitler. There is no type of worship on the part of the German people..some even still feel guilty. Some don't like joking about him. Overall the German people feel a duty to not sit by and allow a new Hitler to do what Hitler did. So, they study history and they talk about it."}]}
{"id": "5a8vh9", "input": "What is eczema and why is it only in small areas of skin only? Why do only certain people get it?", "output": [{"answer": "I have eczema and my husband is a dermatologist. I have made him explain eczema to me multiple times. This is what I have learned. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a skin barrier function problem. The skin is supposed to keep stuff out- think of a slice of cheddar cheese. People withe eczema are born with skin like Swiss cheese. Stuff gets in more easily and moisture gets out more easily than normal skin. Because things get into the skin, the immune system responds to them as foreign objects- you get inflammation that makes you itch. You scratch the itchy spot and you get more skin breakdown from the trauma. Often the eczema patches are areas of friction- elbows and knees. Eczema treatments revolve around moisturizing to add a layer of protection from allergens getting in. Or topical steroids that decrease inflammation. I get UVB phototherapy. It kills immune system cells (lymphocytes) in the skin surface. The allergens still get into my skin but I have less lymphocytes to catch the allergens and cause inflammation which decreases the amount of itching that I have. The only way to permanently cure eczema would be to permanently improve skin barrier function. Since it is a genetic problem, some researchers are working on gene therapy trials that would change the skin cells to work correctly. The reason many childhood eczema sufferers improve is that skin naturally thickens as you become an adult and it overwhelms the problem. Some people aren't so lucky. Also, people with eczema are more likely to have asthma (allergens get into the skin first and you develop an immune sensitization to the allergen. When you breathe in the same allergen your body sees it as something to fight so you get inflammation and bronchorestriction in the lungs - this is asthma). If you could fix the skin at birth, you would not get the allergens getting into the skin. There would be no inflammation and no itch. We can't do that yet do we target inflammation with immune suppressing drugs like tacrolimus or topical steroids. Moisturizer helps too by improving skin barrier. Right now I have eczema on my eyelids (thin skin), left wrist (friction from watch), hands (loss of natural oils from washing my hands all of the time), both inner elbows and back of knees (areas of friction) and armpits (from clothes rubbing against my skin)."}]}

Hoping to maximise the size of the trailers, the tractors are built to put as much power as possible in as little room as possible, so as not to exceed that 19.75 metre upper size limit for semis. In the USA, these size requirements are less strict. Afaik, it's completely legal to transport massive cargo across US highways, including complete houses. Since the limits are less hard, it's easier to use more conventional engine-before-cabin designs. A second reason to use the EU design is because the flat end means better forward visibility. Since there isn't an engine compartment right in front of you, there isn't a giant wedge that blocks vision to the road some distance ahead of you. *tiny edit* Sure, you still can't see what's within a metre or two ahead of you in either case because you're still high up, but with EU trucks this is easier to circumvent with a conveniently placed mirror. Trying the same on an US truck makes the mirror either uselessly small or so large it's in the way. Lastly, I cannot be so sure about the aerodynamics of the flat end, but I can assume that the flat heads are a bit lighter, so if there's a small aerodynamic difference between the two, there may be a bit of a trade-off, US trucks having a plus on aero, EU trucks having a plus on mass."}]}

Why is it valued so much?", "output": [{"answer": "Once upon a time, the British spread all throughout the world and conquered very many countries. Often, when they did this, people in the countries they conquered would start learning English. Sometimes this was because the British would force them, other times it was because its really useful to be able to talk to the people who just conquered your country. Meanwhile, Britain was a very powerful country, so even people who didn't get conquered found it useful to learn English so they could talk to British people. Later, the United States grew more powerful than Britain, but because Americans also speak English, the language was just as useful. So what did all this lead to? The English language was 1) a good language for talking to powerful people and 2) spoken in many parts of the world. This means that it was in an ideal place to become a global *lingua franca* -- if two people meet, and one speaks Language X but the other speaks Language Y, it's likely they both speak English, so they will often talk in that. This lingua franca status and the fact that a few English-speaking countries are still very powerful means that many important international groups use English: conventions of scientists, air traffic controllers, politicians, etc. TL;DR: English lets you talk to a wider range of people, and more powerful people, than many other languages"}]}

If you haven't eaten in 5 days and you come across a decomposing deer, you might just go ahead and try to pick out some fresher parts. Even if you hunted and killed a fresh animal, you have no idea what kind of diseases or toxins that animal may be carrying, and could ingest something awful. - Furthermore, some peoples didn't live in temperate, plentiful regions. These people took what they could get. - A fair proportion of people probably had one or more skin or tissue conditions, that is until they couldn't keep up and were left behind; or until they got so infected and nasty that they died of it. - People were small because they didn't eat much and didn't have adequate nutrition. So, really, most humans were *at least* a little fucked up by malnutrition. Aches, pains, disorders, etc. And vast sums of people died directly or indirectly from malnutrition. But the brilliant thing about the continuation of a species is that you don't have to have that many of your species survive to keep on going. As long as the strongest/luckiest among us survive, we can keep multiplying at a pretty steady rate.

You could see the steel beam that runs down the side of the van in relief, every body panel and window on the left side of the van was crushed. Fortunately there were no serious injuries in the van (but probably lots of whiplash). In summary: momentum is awesome. As far as I can recall, this bus had no seatbelts.

[Never mind that this was not the norm - we're talking myths here.] The Civil War destroyed the south quite comprehensively, and it took a century to recover - if it ever really did in Mississippi and Alabama. People have a tendency to look back to a better past when their present is grim. So the idea emerged that the South had just been ground down by a tyrannical North, intent on planting its boots on the neck of freedom loving patriots, etc, etc. Add this to the actual records of the war itself, with some truly spectacular commanders (I point to Robert E. Lee, who was a brilliant commander with balls of steel - and who felt that slavery was an evil institution but still fought on that side.) plus amazing tenacity on the part of the common soldiers often well beyond what we would consider rational. People who had been so comprehensively beaten want to find some positive things in their defeat.

Also, the specifications of cars sold in this market have been designed to cut corners and save costs where allowed by our own rules and regulations. Germans are generally raised to obey the rules for the sake of the common good. Example: In German cities everywhere you'll see people standing waiting the for the lights to change at a pedestrian crossing when there aren't even cars in sight. They have a saying there that, \"even during a protest, nobody will walk on the grass\". Basically it means that even when a large number of people who are pissed off and exercising civil disobedience, they'll still kindly obey somebody's sign asking not to walk on their grass... You rarely see this in the States; if somebody can get away with something here and/or they feel like they deserve it, they'll probably just do it. This difference in mindset is even more visible in how we drive in the US. I live in NJ so my experience definitely falls on the worst end of the spectrum, but there is zero lane discipline on the highway here. Keep right, pass left? Fuck that! People doing ten under the speed limit sitting in the left lane oblivious to reality, others getting impatient and zipping around them at 90mph in the right lane... Unrestricted speed limits absolutely depend on people exercising lane discipline and following all other restrictions with religious discipline. Could you imagine if somebody pulled in front of you without signalling while you were doing 150mph in the left lane? Fiery death. This brings me to my next point, which is that cars sold in the EU all have superior brake systems compared with US market vehicles. Since any car sold in the EU may wind up on the autobahn cruising at triple digit speeds, they have to be able to slow down repeatedly from top speed without brake fade or instability. Cars sold in the US that aren't in the premium market segment (so around $35k and under) all have the bare minimum in terms of stopping performance. Additionally, vehicle inspection in the US is also a joke compared with Germany. For example, here in NJ there is no more safety inspection. If your car passes emissions you could have no seatbelts, a cracked windshield and brakes with 10 years of wear on them and you'll get a valid inspection sticker. Put a car like that on a highway where you can do 120mph all day and that person would invariably die or be the cause of someone else's untimely death. TL;DR: America just doesn't have the driver education and enforcement required to make something like the Autobahn work safely... And we suck at cooperating with each other for our own sake."}]}

To me, the worst part is how they want to set up off-shore \"investor-state dispute settlement tribunals\" that aren't regulated by any governing body, and give corporations the right to sue Governments for undue actions (eg new laws) that reduce their profits. Start a publicly funded wind farm? A coal company could sue your Government for stealing customers. Amend a law to include a new species and protect their only habitat from forestry? Off to the corporation court as that's lumber that now can't be sold. The Government wants to publicly fund a revolutionary, life-saving, cheap new medicine that could revolutionise healthcare?

This was discussed at length during the Supreme Court hearing (by Kennedy, I believe), pointing out that the government had never claimed the power to force individuals into engaging in commerce with other private parties under penalty of law. 2.) It was a windfall for the very insurance industry that was villainized during its passage. You would be hard-pressed to think of a better way to enrich the Insurance companies while doing very little to address the underlying issues with the cost of healthcare. 3.) It is detrimental to a significant portion of young working families by either forcing them to buy insurance at a time when it is reasonable to forego it due to low risks or to buy it at higher premiums. 4.) The law was huge and complicated, but passed in a rushed, opaque manner at a time when the Democrats had a near supermajority in Congress. It really felt like they were trying to slip something by before anyone had a chance to fully analyze it, leading to a very difficult implementation. The law was rapidly written in a piecemeal fashion by multiple parties, leading to contradictory language and badly in need of a streamlined approach. 5.) It failed to remove long-standing and important barriers to insurance access such as the an on interstate purchase of insurance. This a particularly egregious example of congressional overreach based on the Commerce clause of the Constitution. Congress simultaneously bans interstate commerce on insurance and claims the right to regulate it as interstate commerce. 6.) It is the worst of all solutions. It is neither the relatively simplified and easily regulated single payer solution nor the fully competitive free market solution (I.e. removing barriers like in number 5), but with arguably some of the worst elements of both. I could g on, but I hope this at least shows that it's not all partisan vitriol spewed by puppets of the almighty Fox News clown show as some claim."}]}

They won't appear as external drives, though, but instead they'll connect through networking. Or-- again, on a Mac-- you can put one of the computers into \"target disk mode\" which will make it appear as an external drive. Part of what might be confusing you is, these ports don't just hook into the hard drive. When you plug a USB hard drive into your computer, it's not like the internal drive and external drive are two buckets, and the USB cable is a hose connecting them. It's a lot more complicated. There's a whole bunch of computer stuff in both the computer and the external hard drive that are talking to each other, and figuring out how to transfer data. So you can only do that if Firewire and Thunderbolt because it's all been designed to work that way. USB was not designed that way."}]}

The original study re: how toxic marijuana smoke is was done by a doctor out of UCLA medical. He correctly noted that marijuana smoke contains many times more tar and carcinogens than tobacco smoke. **HOWEVER**, the same doctor, curious from his study, performed another extensive one looking into the actual health affects of the smoke. After all, with such a substantially higher level of risk, there should be a higher level of detectable harm. What he found, though, was that people who smoke marijuana are no more likely to get lung cancer than people who do not smoke anything. The media often reports about his first findings while ignoring the follow-up. As to why it is that way, as others have pointed out, it's difficult to do such studies in the US due to federal law, so we aren't sure. The leading theory is that the cannabinoids in marijuana negate the carcinogenic effect. I'm hoping there's enough in that for someone else to do the googling.

{"id": "3vay0c", "input": "If nuclear energy is so efficient, green and is incredibly safe nowadays, why haven't we constructed any more power plants?", "output": [{"answer": "Construction of nuclear plants is difficult and carries a lot of risks. Risks of delay, cost overrun, technical problems, unexpected design problems. Because nuclear plants are complicated, they tend to be very big - big projects have their own problems. 1. You need a ton of workers to build them (and there may not be enough workers available with the special skills needed). When Finland started building a new nuclear plant in 2005, there weren't enough nuclear certified welders in Finland, so they looked to next door Sweden and Norway. Still not enough. They had to get workers in from as far away as Bulgaria. The result was you had workers speaking 20 different languages, doing complex difficult jobs, and well - not everyone got things right, so a lot of work had to be dismantled and done again. 2. There may be unexpected construction problems. A similar reactor was being built in France. The nuclear inspectors required that the reactor pressure vessel be of suitable quality. However, you can only analyse the steel by cutting a chunk out and examining it - so you can't do it with the finished pressure vessel. You have to build a prototype using the exact same method, and then cut up the prototype for inspection. For reasons of time, the builders installed the first pressure vessel they made, then started building the sacrificial one. By the time the sacrificial one was ready, the original one had been installed and welded in, and the concrete containment building had been built around it. The sacrifical reactor failed the quality tests, indicating that the manufacturing process was flawed and the installer reactor vessel could not be trusted. No idea how they are going to get out of this problem. 3. Sometimes design problems crop up late. The UK designed a 2nd generation type of reactor called an advanced gas cooled reactor. These were designed to use natural uranium (i.e. uranium as it comes from the refinery, without the very expensive and difficult enrichment process). The design was to make the fuel by putting uranium pellets into tubes made of the special metal beryllium. Beryllium is useful because it is completely transparent to the radiation in the reactor so, doesn't affect the nuclear reaction. By the time the plants were already mostly built, it was realised that there were problems with the beryllium and the fuel was redesigned to use stainless steel but this change meant that it would be impossible for the reactors to operate on natural uranium, and enriched uranium was required. This change pushed up the cost of fuel so much, that there was talk of abandoning some of the reactors because the fuel would be too expensive. 4. Because these projects take so long, there is very little \"learning\" on the job. In most jobs, the first one is the most difficult, and once you've done one job, you sort of know what you are doing and where the problems are. By the time you've done 10, you've pretty much started to crack the problems. If, however, a job takes 10 years - then by the time the job is done, workers are retiring, or have moved away, died, left the country, changed career, etc. Not very many workers build 2 or more nuclear plants. As a result, even building a 2nd or 3rd is much more risky than you might expect. This is often made worse because different utilities or local governments may want to have preferred suppliers for parts or workers, so different suppliers get brought in, even for the same overall design. 5. Because construction is so expensive, it adds a lot of financial risk. A lot of money has to be borrowed, because not many companies just have $20 billion cash sitting in the bank. Because so much money needs to be borrowed, it needs to be repaid over a long period - so, this means that changes in interest rates are a big risk. If interest rates rise, then a 30 year loan has 30 years of extra interest to pay, whereas a 5 year loan for a simple gas plant, only brings 5 years of extra interest risk. Because of this risk, the money lenders often want a higher rate for these longer loans...."}]}

It hasn't. If anyone is interested:  URL_1  It's a capitalistic nation for most of its history. In 1911, a capitalistic \"Republic of China\" was established. The country's first president was Sun Yat Sen. Its second president was Chiang Kai Shek. Chiang Kai Shek's government was very corrupt. People were struggling to eat. The fact that income inequality was too great of a problem in China was what fueled the rise of the \"People's Republic of China\" in 1949 by \"Chairman\" Mao Ze Dong. At the time, communism was thought to be the solution to the economic inequality problem. The only problem was - it killed productivity. Mao Ze Dong has a very idealistic world-view (most of the ~~communist~~ dictatorial leader does - Hitler for example). His idealistic world-view brings the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. This is what's portrayed by the Western world. In 1976, Mao Ze Dong passed away and gave a way for other leaders to emerge. One of these leaders is Deng Xiao Ping who initialized the privatization of enterprises in China - again. All in all - the Chinese economy was a socialist from 1949 to 1978 - a 29 year ordeal. Western Propaganda is another issue though. Based on this:  URL_0  , the Chinese government launched a $586 billion stimulus program in 2008. Do you remember who else had a stimulus program ? TL;DR - Income inequality has always been a problem in China. Communism was just another effort to minimize this."}]}

I wanted to stay up for 100 hours, straight. This was 13 years ago so I don't recall everything about it anymore. I got up at around 2pm (this was during summer vacation) and I was in weird sleep schedule mode already from staying up until 5-6AM playing games online, and then crashing and getting up in the middle of the afternoon... As long as I had finished school with good grades, nobody gave a rats ass about what I did on my vacation time. *Specially* if it was inside the apartment, where in theory is \"safe\". I'd stayed up for an entire day before (24 hours) and it didn't feel like too much of a hassle... it wasn't unusual for me to do that during vacation, actually... I'd get up progressively later into the day, until I found myself sleeping around noon, waking up at around 8-9pm, and then just staying up until next day's 8-9pm and get my sleep cycle back on track. 30ish hours weren't too terrible either. I'd pulled that off before (wake up around 1-2pm, stay up until 8-9pm of the next day, sleep and be back on cycle). I thought I had experience with this stuff, and I wanted to see how far I could push it. That's where the 100 hours came from. Why? Because I was young and stupid and I just wanted to be able to say I did it. ...so where was I? Right, I woke up at around 2pm, and this is when I started counting, and I was sure I was going to do it. Just lounged around the house for the most part. Internet connection wasn't that great during the day because the lines in my neighborhood were prone to being overloaded during the day while everyone was awake, but it played very smoothly during the night after everyone went to sleep. It was playable during the day, it just wasn't the *OMG* experience it was at night. I remember the afternoons and nights being the easiest part of staying awake. Because there was so much to do. There was always stuff around the house, friends to talk to, things to keep my mind busy and active... and I found that, that was the secret to staying up. Staying mentally active. The most difficult times honestly were from around 6AM to 10AM, if that makes sense. Because it was just SO DEAD... nobody online to play with on my usual servers... servers in other timezones weren't an option because they were really bad, connection wise. My friends were all asleep and they wouldn't be awake for hours. No movement going around my house either. It made sense to me why this is the hour I usually peaced out and slept. So that slice of the day... from 6AM to 10AM... ish, that was the real bitch. But I got the first day done, and now my apartment was bristling with family going around, people coming... and what am I even talking about You guys don't care about what I did to stay up. You guys care about what I felt. Sorry for losing focus. = I remember distinctly that the first day was OK. Other than that feeling of being slightly tired, there's nothing that I can really remember about it. You know that feeling behind the back of your eyes. The second day, that feeling was constant, and much higher in intensity. The less active I was, the more it hit me. I found myself having to will through the dead hours of the morning. I never left my computer chair because I was sure I would fall asleep if I decided to lay on my bed and read something. So I just browsed the internet... random things... anything. The 48-72 period is when things started getting interesting. I was permanently tired. I felt physically tired, even though I had done nothing to warrant feeling physically drained... I didn't DO anything physically involving in all of this. It was all TV and videogames. But I felt super tired.. Like I'd just finished playing soccer for an entire afternoon with my friends. My eyelids felt like they hung from about a third down of where they normally would... my body wanted to shut my eyes and just make me sleep. I only stayed up during the dead hours of the morning for this period by PACING around the apartment. I just walked from the kitchen to the living room... to the balcony... back to my room... I did this until people started getting up. Then I went back to my room, I didn't want people asking questions about how long I'd been up for. the 72-90 period is when things got downright scary. I now had a headache. Persistant. Throbbing. It didn't start out too terribly and I didn't care much about it at first. But it got progressively worse over a short amount of time. I took some meds and thought I would be alright. I took a tylenol, and I remember it being one of those extra strenght tablets, and I went straight into the bathroom for a scalding hot shower. That's always been my 'miracle cure' for a headache... take meds + stupid hot water on my head til I don't feel anything... by the time the effect from the shower is gone, the meds have kicked in... and i'm fine. It did jack shit. Which caused me to take ANOTHER extra strength pill. (Looking back... I'm sure my liver is not happy with me to this day for this) My eyes hurt. My head felt like it was going to explode. My body felt like it had lead hanging off every limb. Everything felt heavy, everything was hard to do. Then it was around 5 AM. My computer needed a reebot. It'd been asking for one for longer than I could remember... and I decided... why not. It took forever to do this, it would be a way to kill time. Things were slowing down considerably by now online anyway. So I started the reboot process, it would take at least 5 mins for this thing to be fully back up and responsive. I laid down on my bed and stared at the ceiling while I watched the monitor change the intensity of light and color, from the corner of my eyes. Then I looked to my left, where my alarm clock was: 5:30 AM. I stared back at the ceiling and kept paying attention to the monitor lights coming from the corner of my eyes. I remember thinking \"It's still doing it?\" So I looked back at the clock to see how long it'd been 5:15 PM. **WHAT. THE. FUCK** I jumped up from the bed, because there this didn't make any fucking sense. I had just looked at the fucking thing, it was 5:30 AM, and 30-45 seconds later it was saying 5 something **PM** ?? The alarm must've been malfunctioning and I told myself \"just go check the one in the kitchen\" But then it hit me. The light from outside. Bright as day. Because... It was, you know, the middle of the day. Half a day. 12 hours. And I hadn't even FELT it. I didn't even think I lost consciousness because all my thoughts were still in order. I clearly remembered my thought train. I was waiting on the computer to boot back up. I was annoyed it was taking too long, so I went to check the clock again and somehow 12 hours had passed. But the sun was up. Everyone was up and saying hey to me and asking if I'd slept well... Come to think of it, my bedroom door was closed and I had to open it to get out, and I had left it open because I was always going back and forth from and to the kitchen for a snack, or a drink... I have no recollection of those hours. And as soon as the adrenaline lowered from the \"WTF!!!!\" feeling, I felt my body go heavy again, just not quite as bad... the headache was faint, but still there... I'd fallen asleep. I fell short of the goal, so I might as well just go back to sleep. So I did. My mother came and woke me worried if I was alright. I looked at the clock at it said 8 something PM. I remember being pissed at her because she'd just seen me when I came out of my room at 6pm, so wtf was her problem. \"THAT WAS YESTERDAY\" ... I'd slept for over a day. Now, at age 29, I can't even make it 24 hours without feeling like I want to die and be released from the nightmare. I read the top comment here, and people listing hallucinating. I never saw anything that wasn't really there. I don't think I hallucinated at all. But I had the worst headache of my life. And looking back on it, I don't even want to know what that headache meant, but there's no way it was a good sign."}]}

As much as you'd like to, you can't release it all over the world at the same time. It's impossible for a number of reasons: * There are probably 50,000+ movie theaters around the world that will show the film, but you only printed 3,000 copies of the film (because film is expensive to print and even more expensive to store and transport) * The stars of your movie need to promote it--interviews, autograph sessions and whatnot--and they can't be on 4 different continents at once. * Your movie has to be localized--translated, dubbed or subbed, edited for content to fit with local laws and so on--and that takes time. * There are other big events or movies occurring at different times around the world, and you don't want your movie to have to compete for viewers' attention--or you want to take advantage of a national holiday--so you pick the best release dates you can for each region. Bottom line, it might take as long as nine months for your film to complete its theatrical release cycle around the world. So your film releases in March in the US. By May, theaters in the US have stopped showing it, so you get ready to release it on DVD in July, while it's still relatively fresh in people's minds. But in South Africa, it won't hit theaters until December. How do you stop South Africans from importing the DVD from the US, instead of waiting until December to watch the movie in theaters there? Region codes. There's also regional pricing differences to consider. In America, where everyone is fat and happy, people can afford to pay $30 for a DVD. But in Brazil, $30 is way too much for any average citizen to reasonably afford; so you might sell it there for $5.

It is a game built by, and manipulated by people. Yes, the Gambler's Fallacy suggests that all thing are equal in an equal game, but the game is rarely equal. Firstly, saying that the odds are the same assumes that each lottery ball is built evenly. It is very possible some balls weigh more than others, changing how likely they are of being picked. In this example, it is possible that the No.3 ball is the lightest ball, and more likely to fly to top and be picked. Also, it's possible that when they put the balls in the machine, they do so numerical order. This might make lower numbers more likely to surface than the higher numbers. Secondly, some lotteries are fixed. Intentionally using balls of different weights and sizes make more numbers more likely to appear. In some draws, people heat the key balls up so that someone picked them by hand could identify them. For whatever reason, No. 3 could intentionally chosen more often, maybe because the mob boss' son was born in March. The classic example of the Gambler's fallacy took place in Monte Carlo when the ball landed on black 26 times in a row. A lot people lost money because they kept betting on red, think falsely that there is no way that a ball would land on the same spot for as long as it did. Myself, I would have bet on black, because at that point, I would suspect that the mechanism helping the ball land on black was jammed or something, causing the ball the land on black over and over again.

{"id": "k49p1", "input": "Coriolis effect", "output": [{"answer": "Think about a ballerina or an ice-skater spinning with her arms stretched out. Her whole body makes a complete turn all at once, but her outstretched arms have a bigger circle to travel in the same amount of time, so they're moving faster. When she pulls her arms in, they don't have as far to go, but they still have the energy (inertia) from when they were stretched out, so her whole body spins faster than before. Now, imagine for a moment that you're at the center of a spinning space station shaped like a wheel with spokes. Like [this one]( URL_0 ). The rim is a bigger circle than the center, but it has to all spin at once, so the rim will be moving faster. If you climbed a ladder in one of the \"spokes\" connecting the hub to the rim, you'll feel a slight pull to the left or right depending on which way the wheel was spinning. Since you're coming from the center, you're not moving as fast as the area \"above\" you, so that's why you feel like you're being \"pulled\" a bit sideways. The station itself is pulling you to bring you up to speed as you climb. And it's the same way on a sphere. The Earth spins all at once, so if you draw an imaginary line through the center of the Earth (its axis), the equator is moving the fastest, since it's furthest from the center of rotation, like the rim of the disc, or the ballerina's outstretched arms. So if you take a cloud at the equator, and shove it North, it has more inertia than its surroundings, so it will tend to drift a bit to the left (or west). Take another cloud that's North of the equator and shove it south, and it will tend to drift a bit to the right/east. If you get enough energy into a storm system that it keeps pushing clouds north and south, it'll tend to spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere."}]}

A sleep cycle is roughly 70-90 minutes. At the end of each sleep cycle it's much easier to wake up. It's often why you feel so alert after waking up from a dream, dreams take place in the 1st stage REM and 4th stage rem (the first and last stages of a sleep cycle). Example Time: Ok so you go to bed at 10 and have an alarm set at 7. I'll call the 20 min leeway at the end of sleep cycles the Wakeup Zone (WZ). This is where your body is doing all sorts of fun stuff with histamine to regulate your sleep pattern and also where you're most likely to wakeup because its at the tail end of a sleep cycle. (Fun fact: OTA sleep drugs are just high doses of allergy meds (anti-histamines) to prevent you from waking up more often through the night.) Cycle 1. 10:00 - 11:30pm (11:10pm - 11:30pm WZ) Cycle 2. 11:30 - 1:00pm (12:40am - 1:00am WZ) Cycle 3. 1:00am - 2:30am (2:10am - 2:30am WZ) Cycle 4. 2:30am - 4:00am (3:40am - 4:00am WZ) Cycle 5. 4:00am - 5:30am (5:10am - 5:30am WZ) Cycle 6. 5:30am - 7:00am (6:40am - 7:00am WZ) Chances are you aren't really fully rested during cycles 1-4 so the likelihood of spontaneously waking up in the WZ is lower. Between 5-6 however, chances are much greater. Couple that with coincidence and you have the anomaly you describe. You only notice the time because you have an alarm set for it. In that last sleep cycle you're odds of waking up 1 minute before the alarm is 1/20. Note: This is heavily simplified, WZ is not a scientific term an its a bit more complicated than this. But at a high-level its pretty close. Source: Engineer that worked on devices/algorithms that use EEG measure activity in your brain during these periods."}]}

The actual **radioactive material** however, was almost all used up in the explosion (that's the idea). Radiation is very dangerous short term, but once it's been absorbed or reflected up into space, it's gone. Most of the deaths weren't caused by radiation, but by the force of the explosion. Nuclear bombs aren't designed to kill you with radiation, they're designed to be really big explosions... the radiation is really a side effect. Something like 80% of the radiation was released in 24 hours, over 95% within a few days. If you'd stood at the centre of the explosion (on the ground, called the hypocenter) a day after the explosion you would have only received 1/1000th (0.1%) of the dose of someone who had been there during the explosion. Note also that these were quite small explosions - 15 kiloton. I wouldn't have wanted to be there at the time, but it wasn't actually that much radiation in the first place. Chernobyl - Chernobyl wasn't really an explosion as much as a leak. More importantly, it wasn't **radiation** that got out, it was **radioactive material**. Radioactive material can last for thousands of years, and releases radiation. Basically, then, Chernobyl threw a whole load of tiny radiation sources over a large area. Something like 500x as much radioactive material was released by Chernobyl than was released during the bombing of Nagasaki. That's a lot! Most importantly, where the fuel in the bombs was used up and the radiation went away, at Chernobyl the radioactive material keeps releasing more radiation. Let's think of it like hayfever for a minute, as an ELI5 example - Hiroshima was one really big plant releasing lots pollen on one day and making everyone sneeze for a day, then the plant dying. It's nasty, but short term and a one-off event.

{"id": "1ss6cl", "input": "why do bank transfers take days if they are 100% electronic?", "output": [{"answer": "There is an excellent, detailed explanation here:  URL_0  The computing paradigm in the banking world is batch processing. A transaction queue is built up during the day, then processed by a mainframe after each business day - and not necessarily in chronological order. (This is so ingrained in US banking that there are actually consumer protection laws around the order in which transactions must be processed in the batch.) This is partly because Online (live) Transaction Processing at large scale is a Hard Problem, one that companies like Google and Facebook have been breaking ground on in the past decade. We can do it pretty well now, but it's different when you're working with money. Credit card transactions are merely promises - you can correct a bad credit card transaction by simply canceling the promise. With money, once it's transferred, it's irreversibly gone. (Otherwise what the recipient has is not actually \"liquid.\") It's incredibly hard (read: expensive) to build a system which that's instantaneous, reliable enough to be trusted with irreversible transfers, and performant enough to handle every single transfer of value in the US in a timely fashion. Batch processing is solved. IBM will sell you solutions around that paradigm which are nearly infallible; mainframes are *rock solid.* There is a stable and trusted ecosystem here, we know it works at scale, and we can do it cheaply. The delays between settlements allow a large enough window that we can spot and correct problems in pending transactions before any money is actually gone, so the risks are acceptably low. The engineering burden is relatively low because unlike a live system where you have to be fast and right all of the time with no exceptions ever, if something goes wrong in the batch it can be fixed before morning. (Incidentially, batch processing time in the US is during the workday in India and a lot of IT consulting firms take advantage of this fact.) ACH (\"direct deposit\") is based on batch processing system and takes three days because you have 1) sending bank's batch, 2) ACH's batch and 3) receiving bank's batch before money is available for the receiver to spend. It's cheaper for the banks so it's how money usually moves. Instantaneous payments do exist through a service called FedWire - central banks (through the construct of sovereignty) are held to be infallible, so everyone trusts the Federal Reserve to be 100% reliable. If the First Bank of South Bumfuck, North Dakota to Citi to pay me $1,000,000, Citi would wait until the bank actually moved $1,000,000 to Citi before letting me walk away with a suitcase full of cash because that bank might not even *have* $1,000,000. But the federal government is good for all of its promises, so the First Bank tells the Federal Reserve to tell Citi to pay me - knowing that if it fucked up, the United States of America will make it pay. Citi knows that the federal government will make good on First Bank's promise even if it doesn't. So it is reasonable for Citi to let me walk away with the money immediately. FedWire is live but expensive to operate, so its transaction fees are prohibitive for small-time users. I can technically make a wire transfer from my bank account which would clear instantly, but it'd cost $25. It's just riskier and more difficult for everyone involved so this kind of makes sense. Incidentally FedWire, ACH, and the Fed's other functions along these lines explain why the federal government has a right to regulate banks: it promises others that they are stable and correct, so it takes steps to make sure that this is so. It can also create money this way - normally when it tells a bank \"you now have $100m\" it holds someone else responsible for handing over $100m, but it can choose not to. Because it *is* the clearing-house, *is* the entity designed to prevent double-spends, it gets to double-spend. Bitcoin is (supposed to be) equally reliable without involving any such authority, making it very popular with people who don't like authority or are uncomfortable with the idea of an infallible, all-powerful entity forcing everyone to play fair but exempting itself from its own rules. (I don't have the economics background to have a strong view here, but you can see why some people are opposed to central banking.)"}]}

What is a domain of life?", "output": [{"answer": "In biology, organisms are classified in a specific pattern. [Here's an example showing that pattern for a leopard.]( URL_0 ) Each species is grouped a genus, which is grouped in to a family, which is grouped into an order, which is grouped into a class, which is grouped into a phylum, which is grouped into a kingdom, which is grouped into a domain. Confusing, isn't it? Without getting into the details of what each term means, each level of classification answers a general question about the species. For example, is the species a plant or an animal? If it's a plant, it is categorized in the plant kingdom. If it's an animal, it is categorized in the animal kingdom. As you move through the levels, the questions get more specific. A domain is the most general categorization on the list, even more general than asking whether an organism is a plant or an animal. It groups every species into eukarya, bacteria, and archaea. Eukarya includes every species you can see, and even a bunch of microscopic ones. Just think of them as all plants an animals. Bacteria refers to lots of single-cell organisms. Archaea refers to a bunch of single-cell organisms different from bacteria. Archaea live in weird environments, so they're not observed frequently, and the vast majority of people probably haven't heard of them. So, to make a long story short, the domains of life separate bacteria from non-bacteria (along with a 3rd category of little consequence). The mention of large viruses as a 4th domain suggests that perhaps there's a group of virus-like organisms that are so different from anything we've seen before that they would count as their own, giant category of species."}]}

These are devices that are either activated manually by a flight crew member or automatically during a sudden deceleration (crash). Modern ELT's use a satellite network and a frequency band that narrows a possible search area to several square miles. In addition, many of these newer ELT's will also transmit GPS coordinates to the satellite, which very literally takes the Search out of Search and Rescue. Unfortunately, the move to newer ELT's has not been compulsory for all aircraft, and older technology radios are still used in a majority of general aviation aircraft. These radios do not emit useful signals in many incidents, and do not allow for as accurate location determination. The average search time using the older equipment without any other information in the US is over 36 hours. In some cases, victims succombed to exposure hours, days, or even weeks after accidents in remote areas of the country, even with operating ELT's. It is too soon to evaluate still, but indications are that the newer technology improves reliability substantially and reduces search time to a few hours. Only about 15% of general aviation aircraft have the GPS enabled Elt's installed. ADS-B only covers a portion of the aircraft in the air currently. It has far lower adoption than even the new Elt technology. The Faa would like more people to use the system, and has integrated traffic, weather, and other information for free into the network to induce more to adopt the standard. The equipment is quite expensive for general aviation users, however, and has proven to be a real barrier for wider penetration."}]}

Fast-twitch muscle fibers are indeed the largest and most powerful muscular movers in your body. Unfortunately, they're also neglected in most bodybuilders' programs. It's time to change this! The human body is equipped with a variety of muscle-fiber types. These range on a spectrum from the smaller, endurance-based, slow-twitch fibers to the larger fast-twitch fibers designed for strength and power activities. But you're right that these larger fibers have physique implications as well. Aside from their sheer size, fast-twitch fibers also store a great deal of carbohydrates. For every gram of carbohydrate you store, you also draw about 3 grams of water into the muscle. Thus, bodybuilders who optimize fast-twitch fiber development will obtain a fuller and denser look onstage. The balance of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers in your body is determined by genetics, but there's still plenty you can do in your training to maximize growth and strength in the muscles you have. Specifically, consider two variables when trying to activate fast-twitch muscle fibers: the amount of weight you lift and how you manage fatigue during sets."}]}

(Blood rushing to surface allows one to cool off faster) So the stress response makes sense and it is useful. Humans or maybe all higher order or all mammals (dogs maybe, or even rats) have social hierarchies that outside survival pressures there are social pressures. Embarrassment is a stress response to social pressures. Evolution is not purposeful, it just sticks with what already works.

Started in 1958 with one family. Pastor Cho began preaching on the Three-Fold Blessing (the blessing of the spirit, soul, and body), proclaiming that physical health and financial prosperity are as much a part of God's will for Christians as the salvation of the soul. Inspired by his message of hope and monetary wealth, many previously uncommitted people joined the church, and by the beginning of 1961, membership had grown to a thousand. By the late 60's membership was around 8,000. Cho divided the city of Seoul into zones, with church members in each zone comprising a \"cell\" that would meet on a weekday for worship and bible study in the home of a \"cell leader.\" Cell members were encouraged to invite their friends to attend cell meetings to learn about Christianity. Each cell leader was instructed to train an assistant. When cell membership reached a certain number, it would be divided, with about half of its members joining the new cell led by the person who had been the assistant. He also let women lead the cells, who seemed to be more outgoing and hospitable to neighbors. Membership was above 50,000 in the 70's and doubling every few years. Full satellite churches were built around the city, and 5 years ago membership was over 800,000. They probably have over a million now, and plenty of people moving around the country would take the influence and popularity of Christianity with them. **tl;dr** a guy started a church in the 60's, preaching good health and $$$ along with the Bible.

Carbonated liquids like coke shown in the video above are under pressure in the bottle due to the carbon dioxide gas that tries to escape the liquid. this lowers the freezing point until you release that pressure with the satisfying \"TSHHHHHT\" you hear when opening a bottle or can. This causes the freezing point to raise and it freezes before your eyes. Fun fact, the reason why ice is more slippery the warmer it is is purely because the pressure of you walking on it melts the ice a little bit.

There's no general social taboo against sexual or romantic relationships with men - it's only an issue when *men* do so, because by having these relationships they have been considered to be inappropriately \"acting like women\". And there's no general taboo against relationships with women - unless a woman does so, in which case she is taking the \"role of a man\" and that has been considered a problem. For most of the first half of the 20th century neither the law, medical science, nor social attitudes made any meaningful distinction between gay and trans people. People who would now be considered either gay or trans were all considered [**inverts**]( URL_3 ) - people believed to have an inborn reversal of \"natural\" gender traits. A woman who desired other women was considered to be \"sexually male\", a man who desired other men was considered \"sexually female\", while bisexuals were called \"psychosexual hermaphrodites\". A person who was born male, happy as such, and conventionally \"masculine\" in all respects except for his desire for other men, and a person who was born male but identified and lived exclusively as a woman, were considered variations of the same \"inversion.\" The former was seen as \"inverted\" solely in his sexual desires, while the latter was seen as \"inverted\" in all aspects of her personality. Legally, bars were routinely raided and patrons arrested on the grounds that the patrons were seen wearing clothing considered inappropriate for their gender - which was itself a crime. \"Conversion therapy\" meant to make gay people heterosexual focused intensely on gender norms, believing homosexuality to be a form of self-loathing caused by rejection of one's \"natural\" role as a man/woman and over-identification with an opposite-sex parent (the whole \"dominant mothers/absent fathers cause gayness\" idea). The entire idea that there is a strict distinction between gender variance in one's sexual desires, and gender variance in all other areas of one's life, is a relatively recent development. And the social connections between the two are still very much alive. Gay men deemed \"feminine\" and lesbians deemed \"butch\" still face far higher rates of discrimination and attacks than those who can \"pass\" for heterosexual. And \"conversion therapy\" not only still exists, go to any reddit thread about trans kids and you'll see a hell of a lot of people defending it.

There are two things to understand: First there are three universally observable phenomenon that have shaped how every single civilization used the concept of time. 1. The Earths 24 hour rotation upon its own axis 2. The Earths 365 day revolution around the sun 3. The Moons 29 day revolution around the earth Tracking these three phenomenon with high precision was VERY important to all civilizations just for daily function, and became REALLY important when religion started to come into play. All Christian holidays can be traced back to celebrations of the equinoxes and solstices, Ramadan occurs on a lunar cycle, and it was important that they occur at exactly the proper time to please god etc. So tracking stellar movement and the suns path across the sky was a point of great interest to every society. Second, Ancient civilizations were obsessed with the number 60. This makes a lot of sense because 60 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12 so it was really easy to use and made a lot of intuitive sense. There's a reason that a circle has 360 degrees, due to the Babylonians obsession with the number 60. etc. you see 60 everywhere. So the sky is divided into a 360 degree sphere, and as we got good at tracking the suns movement across the sky, we realized that we could divide the sky into more minute (meaning small) divisions in order to more precisely refer to its location at a given time. Therefore we divided each degree in the sky into 60 more minute divisions called of course minutes. So instead of saying the sun was at 72 degrees you could now say the sun was at 72 degrees and 15 minutes to more precisely reflect its position. If you've ever taken a little precalc you'll be familiar with the concept of arcminutes to further divide a circle. So now we started to get even better at tracking the location of the sun and the stars, and even arc minutes weren't precise enough for us, so we decided to add a SECOND division of the sky and divide each arcminute into what could only be called an arcsecond (original I know). So now you could say a certain star was at 75 degrees 15 minutes and 29 seconds to refer to the angle you had to make to view it. If you view time itself as a measure of distance (the sun moving across the sky) then I think you can better understand where the 60 seconds and 60 minutes came from and why they universally used. It's because they're not arbitrary measures that varied from culture to culture, they are mathematical calculations used to track universally observable astronomical phenomenon."}]}

But how could it be deciphered if we didn't have that kind of cheat sheet? A fascinating example is [Linear B]( URL_1 ), a pre-Ancient Greek language discovered on stone tablets on the island of Crete. It was long assumed that it would be completely indecipherable without some sort of \"Rosetta stone\", but we cracked the code in 1952, thanks to decades of study by [Alice Kober and Michael Ventris]( URL_0 ). The first breakthrough came after Kober diligently recorded the frequency and position of each symbol on the tablets (While this type of analysis is not hard to do with computers today, this took *years* of work for Kober). In doing so, she discovered many instances of the same groups of symbols, but with consistently different endings. Through this, she realized that Linear B was an inflected language with different endings based on usage, like verb endings in Latin and Spanish. She also noted that there were about 200 unique symbols in total. Being an expert of many languages, she knew that this was too many characters to be alphabetic (each symbol representing a letter - English, for example), and too few to be logographic (each symbol representing a word, like Chinese). She surmised that each symbol in Linear B likely represented a syllable. Now we have a clear understanding of what *type* of language Linear B was, but how do we determine what any of it means? This is where Ventris stepped up. He theorized that these tablets likely had location names, and knew that location names often stayed similar over long periods of time. So he basically did ~~brute force~~ trial-and-error using the ancient Greek names for towns in Crete: What if a particular group of symbols are syllables that mean something like, \"ko-no-so\", meaning the Cretian city of Knossos? After exploring this idea in countless ways, he eventually discovered a pattern that confirmed this: When he interpreted one particular set of symbols as \"ko-no-so\", other symbols began to make sense. Slowly but surely, that first bit of translation led to him fully deciphering the entire language. EDIT: As /u/QuarkMawp pointed out, brute force was not the correct term. And since this has gotten some traction, if anybody is more interested in this and other sorts of amazing cryptography achievements throughout history, I highly recommend [The Code Book]( URL_2 ) by Simon Singh.

{"id": "38md8e", "input": "Why do people say teachers are underpaid when a high school teacher makes a median salary of 56,356?", "output": [{"answer": "The best way I can answer this is based on what made me decide to jump ship from teaching--which is still a huge passion of mine--about a year before I'd have had my bachelor's (yes, I'd have had to continue on to my master's most likely, but that's beside the point). At my high school, there were a number of teachers who were actually paid pretty handsomely. At least 7 or 8 teachers I knew who got paid over $100k/year. Hell, our wrestling coach/one of the gym teachers is currently making $130k/year (it's all listed online:  URL_0 ) If you look all the way down to the bottom of that list, you'll see that a lot of the newer teachers are right around $35-38k. But I went to high school in Carol Stream, IL. We're not Beverly Hills, but it's a relatively affluent area with an extremely highly rated school system. One of my favorite teachers, Robert Gunther, who is on that list, explained to me that he makes good money because: 1.) He has been there for decades 2.) He teaches 6 classes, and runs or is involved in 4+ extra curricular programs. Many of the other teachers on that list are paid well because they take a very heavy class load and work with a lot of extracurricular programs. As it was explained to me by Gunther, pay, at least in this district, is attributed based on your classload and other things you're involved with. On that list, there's about 120 active teachers, and our school hovered around the 4,000 student mark. Now, I'm getting a little sidetracked, but... Our first classes started at 7:25, our last classes ended at 2:45. There were morning extra-curriculars starting as early as 5:45, and going as late as 8PM. Let's take a teacher like Mr. Gunther with a 6 class load, who also had an AM extra curricular at 6:25 3 days a week, and three others, keeping him until 4:30 or so all 5 days, along with whatever else he actually had to do in the school that day. Now, if you had an extra curricular, you were expected to be there at least 20 minutes early for any students who may be arriving early. One of his extra curriculars also took up 3 hours on Saturdays for 4 months out of the year. So let's examine that hour load 6:05a-4:30p, at the very least, is about 10.5 hours, 3 days a week. Normal days, he's required to be in by 6:30 for his 7:25 class. He's still there till 4:30, though. So that gives him 10 hours the other two days of the week. Not that big of a deal, 52 hours for the week of tangible time with students. Obviously, there's department meetings (he was the head of the psych department, and taught the AP classes, of which there were 4 that year), so whatever other work was needed for that, I can't speak to the hours. But i can say that during those 4 months he was coaching softball, you had to add at least another 3 hours a week on for saturdays, so up to 55 hours. Now, Gunther was a FANTASTIC teacher, but he did rely heavily on scantron exams, so figure we'll add just another 1 hour per week for grading those. Entering them in to his grading software? We'll give that another 2 hours per week (and that might be a bit low), but the rest--not everything was scantron. We wrote a two page paper every week about a topic we were given in the AP class--4 classes, 28 people per class, 112 papers, at least 224 pages to read. I read at about 30-50 pages an hour, so let's call it 40, and say that's an additional 5 hours reading, analyzing, and meaningfully grading these assignments. So, when all of that comes to a head, we're up to 63 hours worked. This is before any test or lesson plan preparation has begun. Assuming he spent about an hour and a half per day planning tests, assignments, and lesson plans, that puts us up to 70.5 hours per week. I'm not going to begin to speculate what happens with meetings or anything else. So there we have a man making $130k/year over 70.5 hours per week. That puts him at $35/hour. That's a pretty nice salary. He's also been doing it for over 30 years. And that's the other part---the last two years, I've been working two jobs, ranging from a total of 55-65 hours per week between the two. I go through stretches where I'm lucky to have ONE day month where I don't do something work related, and I'm damn near burning out. This man has beat me by 28+ years, AND his job involves dealing with shitty fucking teenagers, and their even shittier fucking parents. So is Mr Gunther underpaid? No. But now, what about the woman on the list who has the same workload and is making $36/yr? If she's putting in those same hours? She's making $9.80/hr Pretty fucking underpaid, if you ask me."}]}

These criteria were mostly determined by blind natural selection, so there *was* a loose correspondence between the \"tasty\" stuff, and the \"if you eat this you will survive\" stuff. Over time, we've developed and refined how we make food, to the point where we can essentially make whatever we want. Consequently, lots of experimentation is made possible. Now, the economic system we live in has a sort of selection process \u2014 lots of different food is being sold, but it's the food that people *like* that makes more profit, and is thus sold more, and thus becomes more popular. The effect this has is that, out of all the aforementioned experimentation, different foods emerge: some of them tasty, some of them not. Some of them healthy, some of them not. The thing is, what people *like* is tasty food. So if you're someone who sells food, the tastier it is, the more money you'll make. So *everyone* does this, and everyone keeps trying to optimize *taste*, since that's what sells. This brings us to the reason why we have an apparent divide between \"tasty\" and \"healthy\" foods \u2014 everyone's been optimizing for *taste*, which is only *loosely* correlated to what's actually healthy for you. It's kind of related to what was once foodstuffs that would likely help your ancestors live long enough to reproduce, but not only is the correlation *loose*, but much of that \"survivability\" food doesn't really fit our idea of a \"balanced, healthy diet\". People have been making ever-tastier foods, because that's what everyone is genetically programmed to like, but with the unintended side effect of neglecting healthiness and nutritional content. As a result, we have lots of different types of food that are *really* tasty, but at best \"meh\" for your health. This isn't to say that there doesn't exist healthy *and* tasty stuff. It's just that so many people are making *really tasty* and not particularly healthy foods, that it might be a bit harder to find tasty *and* healthy foods."}]}

What it does is store data temporary, and upon the command of the CPU (the brain of the computer that does all the thinking), the Ram flushes the data and shoots it to the CPU so that the CPU can process the data to display information on the screen. \\n Heres the Problem: When the CPU is asking for a lot of things to be done, Ram starts to pile up and tends to reach its threshold on the amount of data it can hold directly. When this happens, data will have to be retrieved from the memory itself which could take forever and waste a lot of time and effort. Its ineffecient, and makes the screen display things slowly and lag. To solve this issue, the computer needs to unload its resources to stop the straining of ram. How? By shutting down short term memories and processes that are not essential. Its important that you dont have the computer shut down all the way: it can take a long time to jumpstart, boot, and load windows or mac os for you again. But do it just right (via task manager or killing programs) and you have free ram to work freely. \\n The Human mind is no different. We are task orientated species that have multiple tasks for the day. Even if we complete a task, we still keep the task in our mind, and as a result, the mind is cluttered with incohrent shit. Solution? Power napping. We shut down the body by purging all the short term stuff and wake up just before shutting down completely to avoid the shitting feeling, which occurs because the body has to use resources to restart the brain. So really, power napping is the crux of effeciency: reallocating and reprioritizing resources that matter."}]}

Two ways it could be done (or a mixture of them both). Most obvious way is voltage monitoring and abusing the discharge curve of Lithium based batteries. Lithium batteries don't produce a constant voltage as they discharge. Most start at somithing in the 4.0-4.2 Volts/Cell at full charge, and are \"dead\" at around 3.0 Volts/Cell. Discharging past that ~3.0 V number can actually destroy the battery so the device shuts it self off at a preset safe point. The trickery happens in the way Lithium batteries discharge. [As you can see in this shitty graph I just found on Google]( URL_0 ), as the battery depletes to something in the 3.4 V/Cell range, the voltage starts dropping off, and dropping off ***FAST***. So basically the device can monitor the voltage of the battery, but once it detects that its come upon that cliff in the discharge curve (or a preset low voltage), it declares the battery dead. Incidentally that discharge curve is why the last 10% of your battery seems to go away instantly. Smart batteries (like you find in a laptop) might contain something like a teensy current shunt so it can get a real-time picture of how much current is flowing. A current shunt is basically a very small resistance put in between the battery and load, when current flows through said teensy resistance it creates a teensy voltage drop. Using ~~witchcraft~~ math and some formuolis you can figure out exactly how much current is going through the teensy resistor. That information combined with voltage monitoring of the battery can be used to paint a very accurate picture of exactly what the battery is doing, and how healthy the battery is (they do wear out), and how much juice is left in the box. Well that's probably a bit much for a 5 year old but w/e. Hope at least something in that mess is right and you found it marginally useful.

{"id": "4t9lgn", "input": "Why do manufacturers make different types of screw heads?", "output": [{"answer": " > Why there has to be these many types? Lots of reasons. For example, I believe Phillips head was created to solve the problem of your driver slipping out of a slot head screw. Phillips head is the most common, probably just from being grandfathered in as much as anything, but there's a more modern drive geometry called [Torx]( URL_1 ) (or generically \"hexalobular\"). One of the big advantages of Torx drives comes from a design feature of the Phillips head drive. Phillips head screws were designed so that your driver bit will slip out of the screw when you apply too much torque in order to prevent over-torquing your screws. This was a great feature at the time, but in the modern era of torque-controlled electric screwdrivers, it's a pain in the ass more than anything else. Torx-style screws were designed to prevent your driver from slipping out with too much torque, and also to allow more efficient torque-transmission in general. Another type of screw that intentionally causes your screwdriver to slip is the [one way screw]( URL_2 ). This geometry allows you to tighten the screw without difficulty, but your screwdriver will slip right out if you try to loosen it. Most other drive types are primarily to prevent people from tampering with things. For example, I work for a company that makes traffic products that go out on the street, and we use a security screw called [pinned torx]( URL_0 ) (which are just torx but with a pin in the center to prevent people from using a regular torx driver) to prevent some punk-ass kid with a screwdriver from taking our stuff apart. There are all kinds of weird drive types out there, but for the most part their purpose is to prevent tampering. My only other observation is about the screw in the OP's picture with the embossed \"+\" and \"-\". I'm guessing this attaches to something like a potentiometer--i.e. an electrical resistor whose resistance changes when you turn a knob. Potentiometers are often used for things like volume knobs, so the \"+\" and \"-\" tell you which direction to turn to make things louder or quieter. The point on one side gives you a reference so you can tell which positions of the screw give maximum and minimum volume.  > Why not only one type so we dont have to use many screw drivers? Even if there were only one drive type, there would still need to be different *sizes* of screwdriver due to the need for different sizes of screw. For the most part, you can get away with using whatever screwdriver is lying around for a Phillips head screw, but using the wrong size will make you more likely to strip out the head. In some contexts this doesn't matter too much, but there are a lot of situations where it does. Also, other drive types (e.g. torx) are quite a bit more sensitive to using the wrong driver size. **EDIT:** Just a couple more, I promise... Two more notable ones are an inset hexagon screwhead and an embossed hexagon (or embossed square--both are in OP's picture). The inset hexagon allows you to drive with an Allen wrench, and the embossed hexagon/square allow you to use a socket wrench/ratchet, both of which give you a much larger lever arm than a screwdriver would. This means in theory they can drive more torque than a regular screwdriver--the issue is a little more subtle than this due to the rather inefficient way that a hex driver transmits force, but for socket and Allen wrenches the answer is to make your lever arm long enough to offset the inefficiency."}]}
{"id": "2gjw3c", "input": "Can somebody just explain \"infinity\" to me?", "output": [{"answer": "Infinity is a very complicated topic in maths, and often counter intuitive. An easy way to visualise your example is by construction: 1. Start with a list of numbers containing just 1 and 2 2. Pick 2 consecutive numbers in the list and take the average (eg. 1  &  2 becomes 1.5) 3. This is clearly always between 1 and 2 so add to the list 4. Go to step 2 From this simple algorithm, you should hopefully be able to see that at no point you would have any trouble finding a new number between 1 and 2, hence the list is infinite. --- But, if you find that confusing, consider the fact that there are *more* numbers between 1 and 2 than there are natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4,...) despite the latter being infinite. A quick way to visualise this is to take any number, n, and consider 1 + 1/n. So you would have 1.5, 1.33..., 1.25, and so on. This new list of numbers has a one-to-one ratio with the natural numbers, but you can see the gaps between this and the list you mentioned. (note: this isn't a proof; the proof involves irrational numbers and is a bit more complicated) Generally, we consider two lists to be equally infinite if there is a one-to-one link between them. But, again, this is counter intuitive! The natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is equally infinite with the even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...) because there is a one-to-one link: natural 1 maps to even 2; natural 2 maps to even 4; etc. Source: I'm a mathematician [Numberphile]( URL_0 ) is probably better at explaining it than me!"}]}

Square-riggers can only come within about 60\u00b0. The closer you try to go to the wind, the slower you sail, so there's a skill in knowing the angle to use to make best progress upwind. Go too close and the sails flap about and you stop. If you want to go directly upwind you need to alternately sail to starboard (right) and to port (left) of the wind. When you change direction, the most common way these days is to turn briefly directly into the wind, hoping your momentum will keep you going until you can start sailing on the other side; this is called \"tacking\". Alternatively, you can turn away from the wind, through a bigger angle; this is called \"wearing\". Either way, you're \"beating\" upwind. When you're sailing to the starboard of the wind you're said to be on the port tack, because in square riggers, the rope holding the bottom corner of the sail forward is called the \"tack\". The port side tack is in use sailing to the starboard of the wind and the starboard side tack is in use sailing to the port side of the wind."}]}
{"id": "4wg3gd", "input": "Why can some people function fine with only a few hours of sleep each night, whilst others need a full night's sleep (8-12h) to feel adequately tested?", "output": [{"answer": "Hello, I work in a psychology research lab studying sleep and memory, so this isn't exactly what I work on, but I feel its close enough that I can give an educated answer. There are a number of interactions that lead to your observation, but the simple answer is that they aren't functioning fine, they only appear to be. With the right measures, a person missing only 1 hour of sleep can easily be identified. First, its important to distinguish between functioning fine after one night of only a few hour's sleep and repeated nights of only a few hour's sleep. While its possible to function relatively normally with one night of little sleep, repeated nights of little sleep will build a sleep debt in 99.9% of people. Your body will start prioritizing different sleep cycles as you become more indebted, and when you finally have the opportunity to catch up, you'll find your self sleeping 10-12 hours. Its also important to know that its not a straight 1-1 ratio of sleep debt to sleep catch up, and you'll often need more nights of catch up sleep than you missed. Second, your body has two sleep clocks that are used to determine if you are tired. The first is based on how long its been since you were asleep. While your awake, a chemical (melatonin) is released that slowly builds up in your body. The more of this chemical you have built up, the more the urge to sleep grows. When you do go to sleep, the chemical build up reverses and the clock resets. The second clock is based on light exposure which is normally anchored to the night day cycle. In the morning, when your body detects an increase of light, it releases a different chemical (cortisol), that works to prepare your body for action. If these two clocks get desynced, it can lead to a state where you feel energized because its time to be awake, but your body still needs more sleep. This is often the case with frequent nappers, the melatonin build up was not completely reset because they did not get enough sleep. The third reason people may not notice they need more sleep is that the part of the brain that is responsible for judgement (prefrontal cortex) is one of the first parts of the brain to be affected by lack of sleep. Simply put, you've lost the ability to accurate tell how tired you are. There is a similar effect that occurs when people drive drunk. They are too drunk to realize how drunk they are and so they make judgement that there safe to drive. Finally, people can seem to function fine with little sleep because we are rarely pushed hard enough to notice. You might feel like this is an argument towards not needing sleep, but in certain situations, your lack of sleep will become painfully obvious. Take for example an ER doctor who has only slept for 2-3 hours each night for the past few days. It might seem like he is doing fine since it would be obvious, and dangerous, if we wasn't, but most of his job is automatic. If a person comes in with a gun shot wound, the steps to save this person's life are already procedure and the physical motions are well practiced. Where you do see these doctors make life threatening mistakes, is in situations that require attention like prescribing conflicting medications or responding to atypical situations. Another example is a student who stays up all night partying and then aces a test the next morning. Recall is relatively easy, so if you were well rested when you learned the material, you should be fine, but learning new material while sleep deprived can be impossibly difficult. **Edit** Another point to consider is that many people get more sleep than they claim. Studies have been done where people are hooked up to a machine that measures brain activity (EEG) and then asked to push a button if they had been asleep when a buzzer sounded. The buzzer went off at different time intervals (1min, 5min, 10min, etc.) after they have fallen asleep according to the EEG, or randomly while still awake. Some participants who had slept up to an hour claimed that they were not asleep when the buzzer went off. Now at the begining, I said this was true for 99.9% of people. There are case studies of a family who only sleeps about 2-3 hours a night, every night. When given memory/alertness/health measures, they perform about the same as people who have gotten the standard 8 hours. Last I knew, the mechanisms of this were not understood, but given that it is most likely genetic, as it runs families, I think its easy to imagine that some lesser form of these genes could be at work in the average population. Not everyone needs 8 hours. Some need more and some need less, but it is incredibly rare to be healthy outside of 7-9 hours of sleep. If you think your one of these people, its much more likely that you've been tired for so long, you think its normal. TLDR: The vast majority of people can't function well on a few hours of sleep for multiple nights, they only appear to be. You can go a while with little to no sleep, but you will need to catch up eventually. There are extremely rare cases of families only needing 2-3 hour sleep. No one knows why this is yet. You are not one of these people!"}]}

Moving forward, one very simple answer is that the victors of WWII rebuilt Germany with the intention of it being a political and economic ally.

By 1950, the Allies stopped destroying German industrial assets after realizing both Germany\u2019s and Europe\u2019s economies relied on the German industry. In 1955 it joined NATO. W.

I'm a medical student and part of our Critical Evaluation module (teaching us how to read scientific papers properly) was debating whether or not cranberry juice helped to get rid of UTIs, so I'll try and relay some of that here. When you have a UTI, most of the bacteria (usually E.Coli) causing the infection make a biofilm inside your bladder or your urethra/ureter (your pee tubes) which helps them resist the flow and acidity of the urine. How cranberry juice was theorised to help was that they contain proanthocyanidins, which are large molecules which may interfere with the way the bacteria causing the infection form a biofilm. The research was ambiguous but from what we could tell, due to the difference types of bacteria infecting young women and elderly men (I can't remember which I'm afraid), some of the studies suggested that cranberry juice might be more effective in the elderly men category. However, since the vast majority of studies were looking solely at young women (who are at risk of E.

Hospitals and doctors need to get that money back somehow, and they do so by charging everyone else higher rates. * Many other countries regulate health prices low enough that companies only turn profits based on products sold in the USA. In other words, the USA is subsidizing the rest of the world. * There is little regulation of costs in the USA. Health care is not a regulated utility like electricity or natural gas often is. It is also not fully government managed. * People are removed from the actual costs of health decisions. There's an attitude that you should be able to go anywhere, get 5-star health service, and only pay a copay of $25. So doctors can frequently charge what they want, and insurance often pays a large portion of it. * It is near impossible to go shopping for health procedures by price. If you are uninsured, and you call around to various places and ask prices for a simple visit or a simple procedure, nobody will tell you a price. People don't ask this, and thus people don't know how to provide it. * In some markets, there isn't enough competition between health providers and/or insurance. In those markets, health costs go up. (I happen to live in the Ogden-Clearfield Utah area, which was just rated #1 in lowest health costs. We have a handful of options, which drives costs down. It's still expensive, but half the nationwide average.) * Some insurance is for profit. Their profit margin is very small (say, 3%), but that 3% does add on top of existing health costs. * Studies have indicated that malpractice lawsuits add roughly an additional 2% that is perhaps frivolously large. * The medical world in the USA feels in some sense entitled to high salaries. Becoming a specialist is an easy way to pull in a $200k salary. Anesthesiologists often make much more than that. There's very little pressure to make those salaries smaller. * There is more demand for skilled medical professionals. And the way people become licensed is heavily regulated and restricted. * The USA largely functions on an employer sponsored insurance model, and it's heavily regulated, insisting that insurance must cover a wide range of things. This also heavily hides costs and choice from consumers. * It costs a massive amount of money to research, test, and approve a pharmaceutical drug. Those drugs only get a short life span before generics can come in and effectively steal the market away. So those new drugs often seem ridiculously expensive. * Our society is fat. * Our society is unhealthy. The recent passed health legislation (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) does little to reform these costs to make them better. What it focused on instead is increasing regulation so that insurance covers more things. It also subsizes the employer sponsored health insurance model. It also expands the role of Medicaid. It obtains lower health care costs by raising taxes on the rich, and redistributing that money to help pay for insurance to anyone making $80,000 or less, on a sliding scale, (if the individual does not want employer sponsored insurance)."}]}
{"id": "4z1xls", "input": "Why does working a muscle to exhaustion with low weight and high volume vs high weight and low volume yield different results?", "output": [{"answer": "**After nutrition**, I think the key is likely innervation. Monkeys can pull more than us because they are wired so that more fibers pull with each nerve innervation. We are designed for more intricate movements and so our nerves innervate less fibers and our movements are more precise. Innervation works on a few really simple concepts of action potentials and nerve endings speaking chemically with your muscles to pull. That's all great, we are going to glaze past all that. After your muscles get the message, calcium is released into the cell, muscles pull, muscles suck up all the calcium (recycling is efficient). Calcium is the key to your muscles working. We'll come back to this. When we train heavy, we are forced to coordinate our innervations and the coordinated efforts require a more anaerobic environment. Lots of laymen will tell you that they learned in Bio 101 that it takes oxygen to burn fat (which is true) so you will burn more fat walking the same distance than running it (which is false). Repeated studies have shown that the more anaerobic the workout, the higher your metabolic response will be. Which means of course you burn more fat running than walking. And even more doing HIIT workouts like sprints or crossfit. And even more doing workouts that require coordination of your major muscle groups like heavy squats or heavy deadlifts. (A second factor is time, doing more efficient metabolic workouts can save hours of trying to replicate the effect by simply walking.) Now we start getting into building muscle. It's pretty well explained how we build muscle all up and down this thread (and badly explained as well). Basically you can increase the # of muscle fibers, and you can increase the fuel supply chain. Thinking about innervation with small weight, you only trigger a few fibers, and with a larger weight you trigger many more. If only a few fibers are triggered, you can do more reps, and those fibers will tire out and you slowly trigger other fibers to pull the load. After lots of reps eventually you burn out as as your calcium reuptake is too slow to keep the process going [Step 8]( URL_0 ) [and here]( URL_1 ) (a key note here is that you don't run out of ATP or Glycogen or Glucose or any of the other types of fuel people in this thread point at, you simply can't recycle the calcium as fast as you can use it). With heavier weight, you trigger more fibers...hopefully all of them...and within very few reps and you start to feel burned as your calcium reuptake is too slow to keep the process going. The difference is that in the second scenario all the fibers are drinking up fuel at the same time. This creates anaerobic or near anaerobic conditions which trigger your metabolism. Your metabolism is a key factor here. Don't let anyone convince you it isn't. Triggering your metabolism includes burning more fat (but that's negligible at first until you start looking at all the compound effects), but more importantly, triggering your metabolism affects your hormone levels. You know those drugs people take to get ripped, hit more home runs, cheat in the olympics, or get competition level fitness? They are based on real versions in your body. Lifting heavy increases your natural hormones. These hormones flip all the right switches in your body to increase your muscle, burn more fat, give you more energy, etc. Hormones will affect your ability to build muscle more than anything else, **except nutrition**. Take care of your hormone levels. **Eat right, sleep right, lift heavy** that's the recipe for good hormone levels. Here's a secondary problem. A evil version of those good hormones I was talking about above. There's more than one, but let's just focus on cortisol, the primary stress hormone. High reps, low weight increases cortisol. Lack of sleep increases cortisol. Stress at work? You guessed it, increases cortisol. High levels of cortisol wreck you. Your ability to build muscle? Cortisol murders that ability. Your ability to cope well and solve problems easily? Cortisol buries it deep. You like belly fat? Cortisol likes belly fat. Think of cortisol like your body's way of downvoting your bad decisions, you think staying up late is a good idea? Downvotes. You decide stressing out about the past or the future are worth your time? Downvotes. You procrastinate at work and now it's crunch time stress? Hopefully you saved up some karma to outweigh that downvoted decision. That guy who can get ripped doing low weight, he's got good genetics or he's supplementing with steroids. Have you been lifting heavy everyday for years but can't put on muscle? You've either got too much stress hormone, too low of the good hormones or bad genetics, a combination.....**or you haven't gotten your nutrition nailed down.** **My advice, get your blood work done, stress under control, sleep on a schedule, eat right, keep lifting, and don't give up.** Edit: I thought of another thing people don't realize is 100% hormones. If you have ever heard of someone trying to bulk but they just get fat. Assuming they were actually lifting weights (if not then duh), the reason they gaining fat instead of muscle is because of hormones being out of wack. Also the cut, have you heard of guys who try to cut but they lose more muscle than they lose fat? Hormones. Then you have bro-science creating terms like eating \"clean\" which don't add up. A man with crappy hormones (high cortisol, low good hormones) can eat clean for years and still be fat. Often these guys get in a cycle: thinking \"I want to build muscle,\" they increase \"clean\" calories and lift heavy only to get fat; pretty soon they start thinking, \"I want to lose all this fat,\" they decrease calories eat even more \"clean\" and lift heavy only to lose both muscle and fat. *Break the pattern, fix your hormones.*"}]}
{"id": "5ck0x1", "input": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "output": [{"answer": "Edit: Thanks for the gold! Early morning surgery is mostly about a condition called ileus. Other commenters have pointed out that fasting compliance is greater before breakfast. While having an empty stomach for anesthesia induction is important (mostly to prevent stomach contents from going places they shouldn't -- like the lung) and likewise not having a lot of blood flow to the gut while maneuvering there is also good those are generally minor considerations (you can drain stomach contents fairly easily if required). One of the more serious potential side effects of surgery and anesthesia is this condition called ileus, it is essentially when your intestines stop working because of surgery. This disease is caused by surgery and can be diagnosed as soon as the anesthesia wears off. While many cases resolve on their own (watch and wait), cases that don't have potential to cause serious harm to the patient. And because of how the gut works and the post-surgical medicines, by the time a patient complains of their symptoms, serious harm may be done. But what does that have to do with morning surgery? Essentially, after you have completed surgery and recovery (which takes some time), your surgeon can then start to examine you for ileus (using a stethoscope to listen for activity, observing passing gas or a bowel movement). With early morning surgery, patients start recovering between lunch and dinner when their gut is primed for activity which when combined with the water (which can trick the body into starting the digestive process) makes the condition much easier to detect. Having the patient recovered from anesthesia also gives some 'lead time' to allow the disease to resolve itself (many cases of ileus resolve themselves within ~4 hours) before making decisions about whether to keep the person overnight. If you are doing a surgery starting at 2pm, by the time the person is out of recovery, they are already shutting down for the night, harder to hear whether ileus is present. (Another consideration for early morning surgery, is to avoid unnecessary drowsiness when out of anesthesia) So with early morning surgery, you make the disease easier to find and prevent (at least some) people from staying overnight if they don't have to. There's lots of other more minor considerations and factors that make life easier, but the ileus is the big factor and why surgeons almost universally start surgery early. Tl;dr: After recovery, fart for your surgeon, it will be music to their ears."}]}
{"id": "28r2dq", "input": "Why shows like Game of Thrones can pump out 10 60 minute episodes in a year, but movies take 2-5 years to complete?", "output": [{"answer": "Typically, shows and movies start off in the same manner, with someone approaching a studio with a script or idea (this process varies greatly but for arguments sake let's keep it simple). The studio likes the script or idea and decides to green-light it, let's start the \"clock\" there on how long it takes to make something. With a show (providing the script is written) green-lighting something means making a stand alone pilot episode. It starts with pre-production which involves casting the actors, finding the shooting locations, creating a budget, and hiring a crew/director etc.. This can take months. Then shooting the actual one episode show, which should take a few weeks. And finally editing it and adding any post VFX/SFX needed, which will take another few weeks, depending on how VFX heavy the show is. The finished pilot will go into the studio to decide whether or not they want to make a season of this show. This will also take months. They will screen test with test audiences, it will be passed between hands, a perspective budget for an entire season will need to be drawn out, deals will have to be made between studios and networks that will lay the groundwork for millions of dollars to exchange between them, a lot of things need to happen. Takes months. Right now we're looking at six months, at least from start to where we are now. If the studio decides to pick it up for a season (or more), that's when you really go into production. Now here's why a show is seemingly pumping out content at a much faster rate than films; it's because a show is already a streamlined process at this point, and you probably haven't even heard of it yet. You already have the locations, the actors, the crew and the post houses (where editing/VXF/SFX are done). All you need to do is start working. A show like GOT probably take 9-10 months to make from this point and in all future seasons. 3 months a straight writing, a few weeks to shoot each episode (which sounds short, but since they shoot in different locations, everything can be set up at overlapping times). Say they can shoot it in two weeks, that's 10 episodes, so 20 weeks or 5 months. And they're doing post production (editing) while they're shooting other episodes, so that doesn't add to the time it takes to make. Add some time at the end for however long it takes to edit the final episode, and any additional VFX needed, and you're at about 9-10 months. After it's made the studio/network will do some advertising and release it whenever their magic 8 ball (carefully analyzed studies) says they should. So, all in all, you're looking at at least a year and a half to make that first season of a show, then subsequently 9 months for every season after that (again all of this varies, but from my experiences this is the norm). The real reason movies seem to take so much longer, is that movies are often announced to the public as soon as they're green-lit, before actors are even attached or a budget is made. That's why you've known the new Star Wars is being made for months now, but just finding out that Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) is going to be in it. And with shows, the public usually only starts hearing about them right before they're released. Movies go through the same pre-production process as a show (without the hassle of having to make a pilot or waiting to be picked up). But another reason they may take longer to make is lot of times they will have a higher budget than shows. Which means a lot more money spent adding VFX or CGI, which, when done right, takes a looong time on it's own. It also means that if the studio isn't happy with something they have the resources and flexibility to go back and re-shoot scenes, or the entire movie, if they so please. Typically if you have $100 million sank into something, you're going to take your time to make it right. A show like GOT isn't afforded that type of luxury since they have deadlines set long before production is done (but IMO they're doing a damn fine job with the time/money they have). TL;DR - Movies seem to take longer than shows to make because they are announced a lot sooner in the process. Or they have a ton of money and want to re-shoot everything. Source: Am a film producer.

Tumblr isn't completely far gone because of the nature of the site. Lots of people still use it for porn exclusively after all. But what makes Tumblr interesting in this case is the echo chamber effect and the SJW ideology which is really cult-like. The ideology of \"check your privilege\" and \"if someone claims they're offended you must never question them, just shut up and acquiesce\" creates an echo chamber where the most radical and crazy voices are pushed the hardest and people of lower status (ironically those assumed to be of highest status IRL) are never allowed to say \"hey whoa, you guys are getting pretty crazy\".

In terms of the urgency from an investigative/safety standpoint, all modern commercial jets require black boxes containing a Flight Data Recorder, used to record information about the plane's flight such as altitude and speed, as well as a Cockpit Voice Recorder, which records all sounds within the cockpit, not limited to just the speech of the pilots.

And the muscles in your belly that push the food along your intestines are like your fingers pushing the ooze around in the toy. The difference in the sounds of the toy and your stomach are because the toy tends to have a few big bubbles, so it gives one short sound for each one, but the food that's being digested tends to have lots of little bubbles, which get squished around one after the other to make a longer and more complicated sound."}]}

Empty your computer's trash, delete a picture)", "output": [{"answer": "Trash is just a folder where files go when you delete them so that you have an option to restore them if you deleted accidentally, they work just as any other folder. When you empty the bin, the file is really deleted from the file system perspective. Typically the data that were stored in the file is not erased, only the reference to it (so called inode if you want to google) is deleted and the space the file occupied is marked \"empty\" so the next time a file is created, or an existing file gets larger, the data of the original file will be overwritten. It is done so because it's a fast way of deleting files, it takes practically the same time to delete a 100 GB file as it takes to delete 1 KB file and since many programs use files to communicate with each other, this prevents writing big amounts of data when deleting temporary files. If the data haven't been overwritten yet, i.e. shortly after deleting the file, it can usually be restored using some tools. There are even techniques to (at least partly) restore data that have been overwritten. There are programs that try to delete the files in a way that is really permanent, i.e. they rewrite the data several times to ensure the data can't be restored. This is handy when you want to get rid of some sensitive data."}]}

George doesn't know *what* he's doing. Not in the form of a grand strategy or anything. He's simply following pre-recorded instructions as fast as he's able. So you keep playing. But suddenly George's instructions start reacting to what's going on with your pieces. **\"There's a knight in that tile to the top right, move the queen to intercept it.

The number of wait commands in the instructions are determined by whether George is supposed to be easy, medium or hard mode. This is fundamentally how AI works.

What if you had a sexually-transmitted disease, and then died (whether the two were related or not) - would it be fair to your partner if everyone could find out your disease status? Different states have different laws about giving out death certificates (they differ based on who is asking for them, what proof of identity they must provide, when the record is released to different individuals, etc). They are listed as public record because they can be accessed by members of the public - that doesn't necessarily mean the entire public, all the time. Also conflating the issue is that cause of death is a data point we collect for public health records, de-identified. We need to know this information for the safety of the rest of the public. If suddenly 10 people die of the same disease in a short time frame, that might be an indicator that we should look for a reason and intervene. As I said, these records would be de-identified to a point where you couldn't correlate a cause of death to one given individual. For a live example of this, use the census website to look at death/morbidity statistics for New York City. You'll find pretty detailed and robust statistics. Now do the same for some podunk town in the middle of nowhere. Sure, the same information exists, but if I told you one male in a town of 100 people died of syphillis, you could probably figure out who that is with minimal effort.

You might need to be 7 rather than 5 for this explanation to make sense though; there are no apples, but it should be pretty easy to follow. First, you need to understand that -1 is the one and only number with the property that for any real number x, x + (-1)x = 0 or in other words (-1)x = -x Or in English, -1 is the number where if you multiply it by a number, it switches the sign. So 8\\*(-1) is -8, 8\\*(-1)\\*(-1) is (-8)\\*(-1) is 8, etc. Next, you need to know that when you multiply two numbers, that is equivalent to multiplying their factors. So 8\\*9 = (2\\*2\\*2)\\*(3\\*3) = 72 You're also allowed to shuffle the numbers around with multiplication (ie. multiplication is *commutative*), so 8\\*9 = (2\\*3\\*2)\\*(3\\*2) = (2)\\*(2\\*3)\\*(2\\*3), etc. Alright. So now let's consider the case where one of them is negative: (-8) \\* 9 = (2\\*2\\*2\\*(-1))\\*(3\\*3) = (2\\*2\\*2)\\*(3\\*3)\\*(-1) = (8)\\*(9)\\*(-1) = 72\\*(-1) = -72 Remembering that (-1) is the number that changes the sign from + to - or vice versa when you multiply by it, you get -72. Now consider the case where both numbers are negative. (-8) \\* (-9) = (2\\*2\\*2\\*(-1))\\*(3\\*3\\*(-1)) = (2\\*2\\*2)\\*(3\\*3)\\*(-1)\\*(-1) = (8)\\*(9)\\*(-1)\\*(-1) = 72\\*(-1)\\*(-1) = (-72)\\*(-1) = 72 Looking at the last three steps there especially, you can see that what you're really doing is multiplying the positive numbers by each other, followed by two iterations of multiplying (-1). Multiplying by (-1), again, simply *means* changing the sign from positive to negative, so we do that twice, bringing us back to a positive number. **EDIT** added a million backslashes in front of my asterisks, thanks reddit"}]}

What do you do with it that an employer desires? Did you make a spreadsheet that analyzed some data? Are you good at social networking? Did you build a web site? Did you write a term paper using it? Did you make a video? Providing that none of this activity includes a negative aspect, all of this can be considered experience. Job experience involves your working as part of a team. If you belonged to a club like the chess club, or sports team, or school newspaper, radio station or had a part-time job after school that too is considered job experience. Now take all that information and apply it to what specialty the job you are applying for needs. Show your love of the profession, and the willingness and commitment to learn the business their way. One job I succeeded in getting was that I saw an ad for a company hiring artists for a night shift. I wrote the company suggesting they needed an experienced art director like my self to head this group of artists. So when you write them suggest how you can be of value to the need."}]}

{"id": "5qhpq7", "input": "What atomic properties determine the transparency of a material?", "output": [{"answer": "Photons carry the electromagnetic force. Electrons interact with the electromagnetic force, however, electrons can only interact with photons of certain energies, depending on a few factors that are too complex for an ELI5. Basically, electrons can only absorb or emit photons of discrete energies (think whole numbers, 1,2,3, etc. You can't have a .5, for example) This means that any photons that aren't at those specific energies don't interact with electrons, so they fly right through the material. Pure metals, for example, are opaque because their electrons can occupy a huge number of possible states, and visible light happens to have the right energy to interact with the electrons in the metal (electrons moving freely through a metal aren't under the same restrictions and can interact with any photons IIRC). Glass, however, has electrons in a tightly bound state that can only interact with photons in certain bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, few of which fall within visible light. Most materials have specific energies at which photons can pass through them, and other energies at which photons can't pass through. Glass is right in the visible spectrum, as is water (which is probably why our visual range is what it is, all the frequencies of light we can detect travel through water easily, I cannot explain the mantis shrimp, sorry).

{"id": "3ewut3", "input": "why is there a \"terms and conditions\" for using a website or program, but not for more 'real life' things like eating at a restaurant?", "output": [{"answer": "There are, just more simplified. What you mean by \"terms and conditions\" are basically contractual terms. Odds are, you will probably enter into a number of contracts everyday. Many people think that a contract is some document full of terms and conditions that people need to sign. Contracts can be oral or verbal (i.e. by action). The terms and conditions can be implied. A contract is simply a legally enforceable agreement. That's it. When you walk into a restaurant or when you walk into a store, and you order food or give something to the cashier, that is the start of the contract, i.e. you offer to enter into a contract. They can accept your offer, i.e. order and agree to provide services or sell you the item, in exchange of something from you, usually cash payment. (i.e. the price) This is implied from every day custom and usage. You can always insert your own terms and conditions as can the other side but the other side may choose not to accept these. Some terms and conditions may be implied by law, such as the food being served must be of a certain standard etc. Contracts can become more complicated when parties want to explicitly spell out the rights and obligations of parties. This is done to create certainty, typically in business settings. There is nothing stopping a restaurant or a store from making its customers read and agree to a 500 page contract, save for pragmatic considerations."}]}

She used to fight as a very brave soldier with her own team inside the second World War. After this war ended which was the last great conflict between multiple nations of our time the US, Russia and China split up a giant fortune that had been raised by a shadowy group called the Philosophers, one of which was the Bosses father. After WWII The Boss quite litterally lost her raison d'\u00eatre, since the purpose of a soldier is to fight for a nations interest and that only. However her maxim of \"Loyality to the end\" enabled her to keep working for the US as a CIA undercover agent on a top secret mission to infiltrate the ranks of a rogue russian GRU major that found the Philospher's fortune and planned on building a mobile launch platform for longrange ICBM Nuclear warfare missiles, planning on pretty much taking the entire world hostage with it and selling his invention to the highest bidder. Through almost sheer coincidense her former prodigy student codenamed Naked Snake (Or John Doe) under the command of his special unit leader Major Zero, got tangled up inside this pastiche of a 60s spy agent flick double cross bonanza. He learns that Big Boss and her super human soldier squadron the Cobras defected to serve Colonel Volgin as Merceneries and later is forced to return to russia and eliminate The Boss and Volgin's super weapon in order to prevent an escalation of the Cold War. During his mission befriends the shady femme fatale EVA and meets the young GRU special units member Revolver Ozelot, who unknowingly to Snake actually is the other CIA secret agent condemaned ADAM. All are trying to get their hands on the microfilms to the secret funds of the Philosophers and it ends with Snake taking it from The Boss and being forced to kill her in order to finish his mission, thus finally adopting The Boss will and inheritance of both her name, becomiong Big Boss, and her maxim of \"Loyalty to the End\". But Big Boss coins this into \"Loyality to the Mission\" and declares that soldiers shouldn't fight for the petty interests of nations but only for their own. Struck with grief he becomes almost mad with fulfilling the Boss' wish of a soldier's paradise. Snake however is betrayed by EVA who seemed to had been working for the chinese afterall but the funds are still lost and I believe are finally found by Major Zero and his team who set up an array of artifial intelligence computers all codenamed after former american presiedents \"JW, AL...\" with the main hub being located inside a satelite codenamed \"JD...John Doe\". They envisioned a similiar world that the Boss was dreaming off but missinterpreted her to wish for a world without conflict and thus the sacrifice of a soldier. After the death of the philosophers the AIs were designed to control every poltiical, social and economic process inside the USA up to having complete control of electing the president and the governing body. They were all linked to Zero but slowly the AIs developed a sense of coniousness and went out of Zeros complete control. In the end they entirely operated autonomously and through their own will. Zero ends up as an old vegetable being held alive by machines strangely though he still manages to synch his vital signals to the Patriot AIs, thus the only way they will finally die is when he bites the dust. Big Boss ends up befriending many important characters in his career as a free mercenary among which are Colonel Campbell and survival expert Master Miller. During his time he also partakes in the infamous \"Les enfants terribles\" project, set to clone Big Boss (as he was teh greatest soldier alive) and preserve his genes for other purposes. 3 children with his exact genes are born to surrogate mother EVA all codenamed Solid, Liquid and Solidus Snake. THis is only the prelude. I could continue but right now I feel its kind of pointless to. Ask me if you have questions."}]}

Insurgents do no have the infrastructure of the WWI German army, where they can just churn out thousands of rounds, either. In my experience, the enemy would set up shop somewhere, maybe the back of a truck, maybe in their front yard, sometimes in the middle of a busy intersection, and walk in 5-10 rounds on our compound. Then, they disappear. Mortar system breaks down, truck drives off, gets moved to another location.

So in a way, when we cry because we are sad, our body sends a signal to our eyes to produce these tears that can get rid of excess unhappy chemicals in our bodies. Animals other than us do not cry for emotional reasons - possibly because they are not developed enough to understand feelings, but they do have other ways of showing they are upset, such as moaning, whimpering, etc. I don't have a medical background but this topic interested me so I hope my little bit of research has helped."}]}

One is of course the battery. Batteries have improved more than fivefold since then - so any electric car would have had considerably less range than today. Then there is power regulation. In a car, you need to be able to precisely adjust the amount of power coming from the motor, which can be done quite easily with a throttle of a conventional combustion engine - but in an electric car, you need to change the voltage. And that is very difficult with a DC power source like a battery. Today, this is done with very efficient and fast switches made from semi-conductors, but 100 years ago, semi-conductors weren't even discovered yet. To get the same result with technology from 100 years ago, you would have to use a very bulky and inefficient circuit to control the engine. Lastly, there's the problem of charging. A large battery needs a lot of DC electricity to charge quickly, making the charging infrastructure very expensive. That's still a problem today, even though electrification and technology in general is much better."}]}

If you had a college degree in *anything*, even English or Art History, you were pretty much guaranteed a lifetime of desk jobs, each higher-paying and more powerful than the last, with The Firm, which would then take care of you through retirement with a pension. If you came into The Firm with a Bachelors, it might actually pay your time *and your tuition* for a Masters. When you went home at the end of the night, work was generally over - there was no email. Calling someone at home was a big deal and used mostly for emergencies. (This era is largely where the perception that the unemployed are just lazy comes from. There really was a time when you had to be lazy to be unemployed.) Nowadays, you need to get into a good elementary school that will prepare you to work hard in middle school so you can take the right classes in high school to get into a good college in a handful of the \"right\" majors, and then maybe go to graduate school, to stand a *chance* of getting a good job if you're also a friendly/interesting person who interviews well. Outside a handful of labor markets, your health insurance and retirement plans will be token benefits (if they exist at all). You'll need to hit the streets, blast your resume around, write a ton of cover letters, and practice your interview game so you can change jobs every few years to increase your salary with your experience. Employers certainly aren't handing out meaningful raises just for showing up. Your bosses may expect you to answer your cell phone or respond to texts/emails promptly late into the night. For blue-collar workers, much of this can be attributed to globalization and automation. For white-collar workers... as just one example, many corporations needed what was basically database functionality long before databases existed. A whole lot of middle-class lives were funded to replicate what I can now do for 15 minutes of setup and $5/month: Postgres on a virtual machine. It also turns out that people in low-cost-of-living countries are just as good at a lot of menial computer-operating tasks. Firms are also getting more and more efficient. It turns out that a lot of the time, you can lay off an entire layer of people who do nothing but have meetings with each other all day and the firm makes just as much money. You can have a \"corporate culture\" of \"passionate\" people who work 10 more hours a week for the same salary and hire 20% fewer of them. On the other hand, if you're *not* a white man, life now is probably a great deal more manageable than it was back then."}]}
{"id": "6rhnty", "input": "Why the temperature going up 2\u00b0 Celsius (or about 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit) is going to break the entire planet, and why we can't filter carbon out of the air", "output": [{"answer": "To answer the second part of your question first, there are in fact ways to filter carbon out of the air. A quick Google search would likely show a few of such methods. The main problem is simply money. The only way to encourage people to spend the amount required to filter the air and then store it somewhere suitable would be to make it profitable. As of right now, it's not. One of the reasons going up two degrees is problematic is the ocean. The last time earth was two degrees hotter was the Pliocene of the tertiary period 3 million years ago. The ocean was 5 or 6 feet higher, meaning that rising oceans will create many environmental refugees along just about every coastline in the world. Europe is already struggling with Syrian refugees, imagine if the entire Mediterranean tried to storm northern Europe too. Additionally, the ocean traditionally acts as a \"sink\" for carbon dioxide stored as carbonic acid. As the ocean gets warmer, the ocean will not be able to absorb as much carbon dioxide. If you've ever taken a basic science course, you should have learned that solids, liquids and gasses all have particles the move against each other. Every system on earth is constantly changing state, but it's at a dynamic equilibrium where the same number of particles evaporating are condensing. As heat puts more energy into the ocean, the carbonic acid molecules gain more energy and shift the equilibrium towards the gaseous phase of CO2. This accelerates the heating process further. Less oxygen can also dissolve if the water is warmer, potentially wiping out or damaging marine species. We already see this with coral bleaching, but worse could happen. The warmer waters mean tropical storms increase in both number and severity. The US struggled with Katrina, and even Ike, what if storms like that happened on a yearly, or even biannual basis? People would flee, increasing the refugee crisis. The heat also affects land as well. If we get to two degrees, bacteria in the soil that digests plant life will increase their metabolism, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere from the soil, again, accelerating the heating process further. This especially hurts the Amazon, as there is a great amount of decomposing organic matter. Additionally, even two degrees means increased heat waves especially in the summer. Rivers would dry up, the lower parts of year round ice on mountains would unfreeze causing avalanches (it already is). The West US would be desert (talking Kansas and Nebraska) as well as the rainforest. The Amazon dried up in certain parts in 2005 due to a heat wave. As temperatures rise those droughts will only become more common. Fire would be a huge problem, especially as rivers dried up. I'm on mobile currently, so I can't include links. The equilibrium stuff is just Le Chatliers principle Most of the sea ice and soil predictions are based on fossil records of when the Earth was that temperature. Tl;dr As earth heats up, more carbon is released, speeding up the heating process. Environmental refugees due to desertification and rising sea levels will be a thing."}]}
{"id": "8uyddw", "input": "Leveraged Buy Outs", "output": [{"answer": "An LBO in principle is the same thing as a mortgage for buying a house. You put down some of your own money when you buy a house, but the lion\u2019s share of the purchase price of the house comes from the bank in the form of debt. Private equity funds that transact in LBO\u2019s do the same thing. Funds raise capital from limited partners, who are large endowments, corporations, and wealthy individuals. The fund\u2019s general partners use that pooled capital to invest in companies. That capital is used the same way your cash down payment on a house is. Assume a company is valued at $100. A PE fund will put down $30 of fund equity and $70 of third party debt. They do this after an extensive due diligence period where they go through the target company\u2019s financials and business model. They build their own financial model and project out the financials to understand how the company can handle the debt load. Leverage, and the purchase price, is usually expressed as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, also called EBITDA. If we assume this company\u2019s EBITDA is $20, it was just purchased for a 5.0x purchase multiple and 3.5x leverage (this is lower than you\u2019d usually see in real life). Once the company is purchased, private equity funds will usually hold the company for five years, over which period they\u2019ll seek to grow their equity investment and realize a return for limited partners, whose fund equity (the $30) is allocated as a percentage of their total percent of the latest fund pool. Funds grow equity by paying down debt, increasing earnings, or selling the company for a higher multiple than they paid. Let\u2019s explore. Assume five years have passed. Company maintains $20 EBITDA (not super great, you want growth). However, they company paid down $30 of the $70 in debt it took on at the advent of the deal. The PE fund sells the company for the same multiple they bought it for (5.0x). The enterprise value of the company is still $100, so to get to the equity, you subtract the debt, which now is $40. Ending equity is $60. Funds think about how well an investment does in terms of two main metrics: internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple of money (MoM). The latter is just ending equity over entry equity, which in this case is 2.0x. IRR is a similar metric that takes into account time as a factor, but less relevant here. A 2.0x MoM is okay. Most funds target 3.0x as their hurdle for \u201csuccess\u201d. So, in order to juice their return, they will also want to expand EBITDA (grows ending enterprise value and maybe accelerates the rate at which they pay down debt) and potentially increase the exit multiple. The latter can be achieved if he market is more favorable five years down the road or if they\u2019ve scaled the company to a point where it\u2019s more valuable. PE funds usually will work closely with management to improve earnings and optimize the business model of their companies to achieve these goals. If things don\u2019t go well, sometimes they will install some of their own executives or replace the CEO. At the end of the day, though, the success of this whole process relies on how good the fund\u2019s due diligence was and how accurate their mode was. If they didn\u2019t make he model accurate enough, they could load the company up with too much debt. If the company can\u2019t reasonably service their debt load, it\u2019s a huge constraint on their ability to function. They bust covenants (a covenant is basically what the lender says a company can and cannot do) and if things get really bad, they can go bankrupt. Basically, this happened with TRU. Bad due diligence. Bad model. Too much debt, and they couldn\u2019t service it with interest payments. Amazon ate their lunch and eventually they had to declare bankruptcy."}]}

The disadvantage of this is that you have to spread your love around - you can't spend as much time and attention on each one as you could if you had fewer kids.

Live streaming is different from say, a YouTube video because of the way it works. YouTube has a 'handshake' meaning packets (pieces of information) are first verified before being sent to the user, so that no/very little information is lost, meaning a better video quality. this is the TCP protocol. Livestreaming sites use the UDP protocol which doesnt involve this 'handshake', which means that if they were to just allow a live feed with no delay, a lot of packets could be lost through transit, so they leave a delay so that they themselves can verify the packets have reached them. Another reason is because of the constant increase in livestream usage, the companies needs to have an efficient way to manage all the traffic and videos which takes up a lot of bandwidth. Steam does the same by throtteling (slowing down) download speeds to it can server a larger population and have a consistant speed.

{"id": "64zwwz", "input": "How does blood circulate through your body after you've had an amputation?", "output": [{"answer": "It helps if you think of your circulatory system like a pressurized grid. Sure, half of it flows one way and half of it flows the other to make it \"circular\", but it is not linear. Meaning blood doesn't always follow a set path. one blood cell might make a full \"circulation\" of the system in 10 seconds by immediately being perfused to the heart and then expelled into the superior vena cava and find itself right back where it started. Another might end up in some stagnated blood in a varicose vein in someones leg and be stuck there for hours before eeking it's way back to the heart. If instead of thinking of the circulatory system as a system that circulates blood, think of it as a three dimensional grid of pressurized pipes that generally flow in one direction. If you cut off some of the grid, the rest can still function relatively the same. That being said, I wouldn't classify post amputation circulation as normal at all. Especially immediately after the amputation. over years, angiogenesis (the growing of new blood vessels) will re-construct a grid of pipes to create the best possible circulation. But that still wouldn't be normal. We can also thank modern medicine for better techniques of surgical amputation. These days we understand in detail the anatomy of the vasculature, nerves, muscles, and have perfected techniques that maximize perfusion of the remaining tissue. If you had an amputation during the civil war when things were much more crude, altered circulation could cause tissue to necrose, and become gangrenous, killing you. If the surgical amputation was done in a way where you had better postoperative circulation in the area you might have survived. So, although there are some good reasons you can survive an amputation and have great perfusion in that limb after, the opposite could happen as well. Because of that, I can't say that someone with an amputation has \"normal\" circulation in that area, although (especially with modern surgical techniques) they may well have excellent circulation."}]}

So you mic the amp and send the sound out through those speakers. The reason you mic it instead of going direct out is because using the mic will give the the natural tone of the amp which will generally sound better than the raw audio signal. Also it allows a sound tech to mix levels on his own without having to constantly tell you in your monitors to turn up or turn down slightly"}]}

Severe malnourishment has several sequelae (outcomes) depending on what exactly is lacking in the person's diet. The two that most people are familiar with are (1) Kwashiorkor - the kind with the really big belly and (2) Marasmus - The kind where the people look like walking skeletons. In marasmus, there is generalized severe malnourishment. These people are sick because they are lacking sufficient calories, thus they become incredibly skinny - they are literally wasting (actual medical term) away. In Kwasiorkor, there is sufficient/close to sufficient caloric intake, BUT there is INsufficient PROTEIN intake. This means that the diet is mostly rice, corn, etc. Your body needs proteins for countless things such as building muscle etc. It also needs proteins to transport fats (not soluble in blood/water) throughout your blood stream. These 'transport' protein are called lipoproteins and are made in the liver. Without these proteins, the fats consumed by the body get trapped in the liver, leading to fatty livers (contributing to the big bellies). Also, proteins are needed to maintain the proper fluid volumes in your body (I won't get into this now) and without it, you retain water, contributing to fluid retention (medically called edema), and thus also making the bellies bigger. I hope this helped :) (Source: 3rd year US Medical Student - Thanks for letting me review this concept!) EDIT: XD This is the first time i get gold! Thank you guys!!!

{"id": "4fyf09", "input": "why does rain in the tropics come down heavy for an hour and then vanish, but in europe the rain is mostly light and can last all day?", "output": [{"answer": "Hey, I don't think anyone here has explained it enough, so I'm going to explain it a little bit more. I'll try to keep it in easy language, but it will probably extend beyond the average five year old's grasp. If you, or anyone else browsing, are really curious about the mechanism behind it, I hope this helps. One commenter mentioned atmospheric stability, which is indeed the main difference, but he didn't explain why. The first step in producing rain is that the water vapor has to condense into liquid (or ice) drops. (If the air rises due to convection, the natural cooling of the air can cause this condensation. So could the air moving over a mountain, or over a cold lake, or many other things). But this makes a cloud, not rain. When these drops form, they are not big enough to fall to the ground. They can float about in the air, their terminal velocity is basically 0. Clouds can stay clouds without becoming rain, happy as a clam. The water drops need to grow somehow, and become big enough to fall. They don't grow naturally, because when a liquid water drop forms, the \"vapor pressure\" (amount of water vapor in the air) above the drop surface is equal to the vapor pressure in saturated air, so there is no driving force to move the water molecules from the ambient air towards the drop, and it can't grow. Hot air in the tropics is unstable, which usually means it has a lot of convection. The air rises, and then can also fall, and then maybe rise again due to wind, etc... lots of \"churning\". This churning makes the water droplets bang into each other, which is how they grow and become big enough to fall out of the cloud. But if there is a lot of convection, it now has to get big enough to not just \"fall out of the cloud\", but rather to fall through the intense upward convective drafts. It keeps banging into other drops and growing until its big enough to beat the convection, which usually yields big fat drops. In colder, more stable atmospheres, where the air isn't churning around, there is a different mechanism for droplet growth. If the air is cold enough, there is some liquid water drops, but also a lot of ice crystals (the water vapor condensed into solid ice, not liquid water). Liquid water has a \"vapor pressure\" (amount of water vapor in the air) that is HIGHER than solid water. So there is more water vapor in the air around a liquid droplet surface than there is in the air around an ice crystal. This difference in moisture content creates a driving force, where the water vapor migrates from the area of high content (the liquid droplet) to the area of low content (the ice crystal). When it nears the ice crystal, it too condenses into ice, and the crystal grows. If there are enough liquid droplets, the ice crystals keep leeching water from the droplets, and keep growing. Eventually, they become big enough to fall, and then they melt on their path down through the atmosphere. In this case, they fall down exactly when they become big enough to just \"fall out of the cloud\", which is usually much smaller than the drops that have to be big enough to fight convection.

For the methyl group, since it's a reactive functional group it primarily makes the resulting chemical much more reactive than the chemical that did not have it. More reactive means it has a larger effect sooner even with less chemical being present. There are several ways to think of it. ----- My personal preference would be...imagine you have a glass of wine and you have a shot of vodka. The glass of wine is probably gonna last at least a few minutes, probably fifteen minutes to half an hour unless you drink it non-stop or chug your wine. The shot of vodka will be finished within thirty seconds, at the latest. Even with the same amount of alcohol, the vodka hits harder because it's much more concentrated and is fully introduced into the body much quicker than the glass of wine (which has a little bit of its alcohol introduced over a longer period of time so some of its effect has worn off by the time the next sip is had). Or comparing an IV drip to a spontaneous rush...that works as well."}]}

With that said, there are a few ways to discern whether or not you are in a dream. I've toyed around a bit with lucid dreaming, and have gotten confused a few times. 1. Look at at writing or at a clock. Note what the writing says or what time it is. Look away. Look back. If the writing is different, or the time is more than a few seconds off, you're dreaming. 2. Trace your steps back as far as you can. In a dream \u2013 even an extremely vivid, lucid one \u2013 you get stuck at some point and can't remember anything before that. While awake, you can trace your whole day back to when you woke up in your bed, then the day before, then the week before, etc. 3. Ask yourself if you're in a dream. Concentrate on your surroundings. Even if you're in a familiar place, is it how you remember it being? Are the physics around you the same? What about the behavior of those around you? 4. Hold your breath for as long as you can.

{"id": "3cl7ti", "input": "How come no country has invaded the United States since the Revolutionary War?", "output": [{"answer": "The easy answer to why they haven't is logistics. During WW2, there was some thought among the Americans that the Japanese were going to try to take and hold Midway as a stepping stone to Hawaii. It was quickly realized that this would be the best thing the Japanese could do from the American standpoint: the Japanese would have to ship in almost all the food required to feed the Hawaiians, since there was very little actual food farming in Hawaii, and the supply convoys would be vulnerable to American submarine attacks. The same goes for any invasion of mainland America: a really long logistics tail that would be vulnerable to interception, resulting in a shortage of, not food, but ammo, fuel, spare parts, reinforcements, etc. When we invaded Europe, we had a staging area in England, so the logistics could be built up there over time, and then shipped to the mainland over really quite secure lines. An invader coming from Europe might be able to use Cuba, but our air and naval forces are much better at intercepting and destroying them now than they were then. An invader coming from Asia is SOL; there is no convenient island on that side to stage from. There's also the fact that no one 1): can challenge the US Navy; and 2): has the sealift capability to transport the kind of forces it would take. Amateurs study tactics; dilettantes study strategy; experts study logistics; professionals combine all three. As far as what would happen, well, they'd be fighting at the end of a long supply train; we'd be fighting for our homes. If it's Russia or China, they may (MAY) be able to take us in the end, but they'd get a burned and blasted wasteland and pay an exorbitant price for it; just as we would if we invaded either of them."}]}

ONLY 5 times... That's it... only 5 pictures.. no other clicks\u201d Daddy shows little Bobby what button to push (next) and let's him have at it. Daddy doesn't realize he cued up the 2nd to last picture in the folder. Daddy was in a hurry. By starting at the 2nd to last photo ----- after Little Bobbie views 2 pictures, he still gets to click next 3 more times. At the end of the folder it flips to the beginning of the folder. Daddy doesn't want little Bobby seeing those pictures because those are of daddy and mommy during their special time. The heartbleed bug is similar in that one missing audit allowed for unintended data to be transmitted (or in Bobbie's case, viewed). When a secure connection is made a request to \"prove\" the connection is still alive is periodically sent out. It is sort of like kaptcha but instead of \u201cprove you are human\u201d it is more like \"prove you are an alive secure connection\"!!! The test isn't a bunch of unreadable letters that tick humans off. It is two parts, A) a random string of characters and B) a return count. To prove you are an alive secure connection you must return a substring of the original string A) which is the length of B). So if the message was \"HEY, PROVE IT\" and B=2 you would return \"HE\". I would know you were an alive secure connection because \"HE\" is the first two characters in the string \"HEY, PROVE IT\". You passed the kaptcha test for SSL dummies.

How could you return the first 10,000 characters of a string that was only 13 characters long? You couldn't. But like a good little connection you desire deeply to prove that you are a SECURE connection. You will do anything I ask! You seek approval. You comply and return a string that is 10,000 characters long. The first 13 say \u201cHEY, PROVE IT\u201d and the remaining other 9987 characters come from your computer's memory --- whatever happens to be stored (in random memory) next to the the string I originally gave you!

{"id": "1n97ow", "input": "How do shampoo and conditioner work?", "output": [{"answer": "If you tried to wash your hair with water, not all of the oil would leave. This is because oil and water do not mix together. When you add special chemicals called detergents, the chemicals that clean things, they can fix the problem. This is because a detergent has two ends. One end likes water and one end likes oil. So, all of the ends that like oil gather around the oil. The ends that like water stick out of the outside of the ball, and water can wash them away. Also, did you ever notice how water stays in a pile when you spill it on a table? Water is attracted to itself. Chemicals called 'surfacants' help the water get through your hair more easily because they make the water like other things more than itself. There are also chemicals added to keep the mixture together called emulsifiers. Shampoo also has a lot of stuff in it that makes it pretty and fun to use. Some shampoos are shiny and you can't see through them. There are chemicals that do that too. Titanium dioxide is used to make it harder to see through things. It is even used in sunscreens because the sun can't get through to hurt your skin. But sometimes,when you clean your hair with detergent, you get rid of the good oils as well as the bad oils. This makes the hair brittle and makes the hair want to stick together. Chemicals like silicone in conditioner cover hair. Two strands of hair would stick to each other, but two hairs covered in silicone are slippery to each other. Other chemicals can make a protein called keratin stronger in your hair. Like covering a broken brick wall in glue. There are also chemicals that add missing keratin to your hair like hydrolyzed proteins. It's like going over to a broken brick wall and putting bricks where there are bricks missing. Different shampoos use different chemicals to do different things. So the best shampoo for you may not be the best shampoo for other people. Marketing doesn't always tell the truth in a clear way. Like, if you broke a lamp and said 'it fell off of the shelf.' Technically, it did. But you bumped it causing it to fall. Marketing companies could say shampoo A cleans with chemical B. People think that means that chemical B cleans really well. But really, legally, it means that shampoo A cleans and shampoo A has chemical B. Sometimes, words are used to trick people on purpose. So, some are better than others, but it sort of depends on what you like and what you need for your hair. A girl with lots of curly hair would use different shampoo and conditioner than a guy with short straight hair. The guy would have a lot of oil coming off of his scalp onto not a lot of hair so he could need more detergent. The girl with curly hair would be worried about her hair getting frizzy because of how curly it is, so she would want better conditioners that make her curls better. But that kind of conditioner would be a wasteful thing for the guy to buy."}]}

All living beings are made from the same things pretty much, so more volume generally means more weight (unless you adopt measures to reduce weight such hollow bones in birds). Think about a cube: if i take a 3 meters cube, the face has a surface of 9 square meters (3^2), while the volume would be of 27 cubic meters (3^3). Now this means that if you increase the size of an animal, volume (and hence weight) gets exponentially higher than surface. Now we have to introduce the concept of pressure, pressure is weight divided by surface. The higher the weight, the higher the pressure, but the higher the surface, the lower the pressure is. Now you can understand my point: bigger animals have a higher weight in proportion to the surface that impacts an object or the ground. Now, all living beings are made of the same thing, cells, so cells of the outer layer are what absorb an impact with something. If a fly flies into a wall, the cells on his outer layer that face the wall absorb the impact and aren't damaged. If an elephant impacts a wall at the same speed, the cells on his outer layer are still of the same size and have similar properties than the ones of a fly, but the pressure applied to them is way stronger due to the elephant having a higher weight/surface proportion, due to being bigger, so the cells get destroyed by the impact. Living being have evolved ways to get bigger, we have a sturdy core (bones), a system of pretty resistant wires (tendons and muscles) and an outer layer of cells that are constantly changed and can die without much consequences up to a certain point (skin) plus many other things, but this can go only up to a certain point, animals like the Blue Whale couldn't exist on the land cause their own weight would crush them. Think it like this: throw a small ball of hollow bricks from 1 meter, most likely all the bricks will be intact. Throw a big ball of bricks from 1 meter and most likely the lower bricks will broke. Ammass a large enough ball of bricks and the bricks at the bottom will crush under the weight without needing a 1 meter drop. You can solve this by using an organized brick structure, iron bars, concrete and stuff, basically sturdier materials and better organization, but there is a limit to how big of a building you can make.

USB had two very precise physical characteristics: it was made so plugging the cable the wrong way and in the wrong orientation would be impossible. *This is why it has two differently-shaped ends*: so you don't plug it ass-backwards. So. The original USB cable had the rectangular plug we all know, meant to be plugged into your computer or whatever else was supposed to power the USB device (if any). At the time, there was just one sort of plug on the other side: the square plug. Also known as the Standard-B plug. The big-ass plug. But be warned: not a big ass-plug, unless you're a midget. Anyway, you still see those on printers commonly, and other large non-portable devices of the sort. We could say the Standard-B plug is the four-door sedan of USB plugs. Takes you where you need to go, solid and dependable. A tried and true design. Unfortunately, that plug was far too big for pocket devices, such as phones and cameras. So, there came the Mini-B plug. Same purpose, but tinier, and as you've assuredly noticed, a bit more fragile. You see that one notably on your Playstation 3 Controller. Somewhere around 2007 came Micro-B. Even smaller than Mini-B, fits in even tinier devices! It came to replace its predecessor, and now Mini-B is largely seen as deprecated: no new/current devices use Mini-B now, they'll all use Micro-B. Chances are your smartphone uses a Micro-B plug as a way to recharge itself. And now that USB 3.0 is out, prepare to see a new and improved Micro-B! That variant consists of a plug with a notch in the middle, and it's designed so its corresponding jack can still connect with Micro-B devices made prior to the introduction of USB 3.0. You'll see that one half of that notched plug looks exactly like the original Micro-B plug you've come to know. **Shuri, you wrote a fucking novel again.

Discussions about the American revolution don't discuss the implications of post-war reconstruction on regional stability until the college level. As children, they learn about the Ride of Paul Revere and narratives about oppressed people being free. In those stories, the US founding fathers take on the role of the Knights of the Round Table, acting as perfectly just rulers who advocate equality, bravery, and good government. It's designed both to inspire patriotism and to help kids to remember some of those early laws and ideas by presenting a simple narrative of Good and Evil as a mnemonic to remember them by. As people grow up, the heroic tales of the Founding Fathers remain a part of their patriotism, and they feel a great attachment to the principles that those men said were sacred. The US constitution nevertheless changes frequently, with the latest change in 1992. Most of the changes to the document don't involve the 'core principles' of Right and Wrong that American schoolchildren are taught to remember though. Generally, when people say 'the constitution is a sacred document' they mean things like Freedom of Expression and the Right to Bear Arms rather than how the US constitution handles a sudden vacancy in the vice presidency. In other words, the Founding Fathers are a channel for people's political opinions surrounding right and wrong. When they are morally outraged by a law, they argue that the Founders would be. When they are okay with a change, generally they figure the Founders would, with today's evidence and information, be okay with a change too. Their actual opinions have very little bearing unless people still agree with them. For example, many of the Founding Fathers supported slavery, which we don't really talk about anymore. But when a quote can be found that matches a Founding Father with your opinion, it makes you feel really patriotic, so people quote them all the time. Plus they were some quotable gentlemen.

Don't worry, nobody hurt a cat trying to do this for real - it's just a way of thinking about how the world works. So let's think about something that could actually happen. There's a rock, millions of miles out in space, and it's hasn't really done much of anything since you were born. All it's doing is flying in a fairly straight line through space. That rock is like the cat in schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment - nobody knows or cares how heavy the rock is, whether it's cold or hot, or even if it exists. You could say that we, on planet earth, and the rock, out in space, are two totally separate \"systems\" - the rock has nothing to do with us, and we have nothing to do with the rock. One day, the rock flies near a star, like our sun. The rock starts reflecting light from the sun and, as it spins, just for a moment it shines the light at earth, right at your back garden! This is really important, because the rock now *matters* to you. You can see it from your garden using a telescope! Your world is now different because of the rock, since there's a new light in the sky - scientists would say that you and the planet earth and the rock are \"entangled\", and you're now part of one big system of things, rather than being two little systems with no effect on each other. So when the rock was invisible to us, it was like the cat in Schroedinger's bag - whether the cat was alive or dead was unknown to us and had no effect on us. As far as we're concerned the cat could be either alive or dead, and as far as we're concerned the rock could either be out there in space or it could not. When we see the rock through our telescope, that's like opening the bag to see how the cat is doing. The state of the cat now affects us, and the state of the rock affects us too. This isn't a way of saying \"stuff you don't know about doesn't matter\" - it's a real part of how the world works.

If you asked any of the countries that have been accused of funding and supporting terrorism in the past they will mostly deny either that they did it or that it was terrorism. Most countries have a very strict public stance that they don't do such things. However in some cases nations might find themselves in a situation where for example a nation that they consider an enemy has internal troubles of some sort and they will secretly or not so secretly support and fund a group of rebels that fight that regime. Of course they will claim that they are supporting freedom fighter or revolutionaries who represent the will of the people or justice or the right sort of religion. These distinction of freedom fighter vs terrorist is often lost on the people that get blown up while sitting in cafes or who were flying in a passenger jets that never made it to their destinations. At other times nations have found themselves with a need for a justification for attacking another nation or a desire to discredit a movement and helped bring this about by creating terrorist attack that looks like it was done by someone else. These so called false flag attacks do exist and have happened in the past, but are also a favorite of conspiracy theorist who see them in many places where they aren't. There is no need for the nations who fund the terrorist to share the ideology of the terrorist sometimes all that is needed are common enemies. Of course sometimes the leaders of the nations who fund terrorism actually do share the ideology and do support terrorism because they are true believers, but for the most part that is not the case. You don't stay in power in a nation like that by being naive enough to buy into the propaganda you feed your subjects yourself. It can be helpful to appear that way though.

{"id": "1csrlc", "input": "If everything is programmed with a programming language how first language born?", "output": [{"answer": "Integrated circruit chips are different. First compuer instructions were only able to run on one specific chip. A computer program had to be rewritten for different chips. Some chips were designed with the ability to behave as if they were previous chips, making them backwards compartible hardware emulators. Most chips are very similar so many of them understand the same basic set of instructions while having some unique abilities added to them. But there are too many different chips with fundamental differences between them and there are different possible combinations of them. Communication and translation between them needs a communication protocol and translators. Someone makes translation programs that translates source code to run on different chips, translating for each specific chip. The same source code could be compiled to run on any chip that had a compiler that translates the source code into an instruction set that could be understodd by a range of chips. That way people can use the same source code for almost any chip. But the source code might be translated differently for some different chips. Every chip could run the program with its own set of instructions, wich can be different and chip specific and it barely ever uses a chips special unique abilities. A compilable source code has the advantage to be designable in a way that is easyer to read than an endless chain of numerical instructions that is only understood by the chip and hardcore programmers. --- The most basic programming languages just jump between the lines and lack advanced abilities. Almost all programming languages allow for Functions. Functions within a programming language are aliases for operations that are repeated a lot. Functions can use other functions within them. Functions can also be recursive by containing themself. Object orientated programming languages are different. Objects within a programming language are aliases for multiple functions and/or variables. Objects can be build of out other objects. --- Another approach is to make software to give the chip the ability to pretent to be any other chip, or to act like a standardized environment of chips. This turns any computer into a virtual machine that is likely very slow in executing any code but also very compartible and easy to make programs for. The PC version of Minecraft runs on the Java virtual machine, making it run slowly but also making it very easy to use on different hardware. The Xbox version of Minecraft had to be rewritten and compiled to run specifically (and more efficiently) on the xbox hardware."}]}
{"id": "1b0jz0", "input": "The Bioshock universe", "output": [{"answer": "I'm also going to throw things into this answer... First things first, the \"*Shock\" universe is a collection of different games with similar play-styles and stories but, there are not many connections between the games. Specifically, there are three different settings within the universe, and some common elements introduced by designer Ken Levine once he was on the project. **System Shock/System Shock 2** These games were the start of it but, I'm not too familiar with them. They're old PC games from the 90s set in a futuristic cyber-punk universe. They were first person games with RPG elements so the player could build their character. In this setting, the player could augment his abilities with OS units and nanites while using melee and ranged weapons to fight against enemies. The player also gets a set of psionic powers that they can upgrade as well. These powers are more \"magic\" than \"science\". Ken Levine first worked on System Shock 2 and he's been the backer of every *Shock game since. **Bioshock/Bioshock 2** These games were spiritual sequels to the System Shock line. Nothing was directly related but, gameplay and story elements were common between the two series. The setting was Rapture, a dystopia built underneath the Atlantic Ocean by Andrew Ryan in the 1950s. Ryan believed that true freedom meant that people should own their own work, and that they shouldn't be stopped from doing something because of another moral agenda. Artists shouldn't be censored, researchers shouldn't have to muck about in red-tape to advance their fields through experimentation on humans or animals, etc. One of the inventions of Rapture were plasmids, which granted magical powers, and were quite addicting. The player comes in after Rapture has fallen apart and a bunch of junkies have taken over. Bioshock 2 picks up years later, after the first game's protagonist has left, and they play through another aftermath of Rapture's demise. **Bioshock Infinite** This is a spiritual successor as well to the System Shock and Bioshock games. The title is a little misleading, and there may be more story elements of Infinite tied into what is to become Bioshock but, for the most part, the setting is completely separate. Infinite takes place in Columbia, a floating All American City, in the 1920s. There are fun magical augments like the predecessor games and the general story elements are going to be the same as the others. You can play Bioshock Infinite without ever having played any other games in the *Shock series. There may be some references to the past titles but, nothing story-wise is going to be tied together to the other games. I would highly suggest playing through all of them though if given the chance (or at least the Bioshocks... I can't really comment on the System Shock games because I've only read about them) Hope this helps and doesn't give too much away. The main thing I'm trying to get at, I guess, is that Infinite (to my knowledge) isn't related to any of the other games in the series via plot elements. Nothing you know or don't know about Bioshock 1/2 is going to have an impact on the plot of Infinite (although being familiar with the gameplay elements may be useful)"}]}
{"id": "t7x7q", "input": "Time Dilation.", "output": [{"answer": "There is no real intuitive explanation of HOW it happens, but here is how they came up with it Okay, so years ago Galileo came up this idea called relativity. Basically he said that Newton's Laws are valid in all inertial reference frames, that is ones that are not accelerating. So what this means is that if I'm in a car going a constant 20mph and a car is approaching me at 30mph, we could assume that MY car is standing still and their's is approaching at 50mph. At the time what he was really saying is \"The laws of physics are valid in all inertial reference frames,\" as Newton's laws were, more or less the laws of physics as far as we knew. So in come a few people: Gauss, Ampere, and Faraday who develop some really important laws governing electricity and magnetism. A fellow named Maxwell expands on their work and realizes that--with some tweaking--their results combine to four very elegant laws explaining how charged bodies move and how magnets work, also that they are very closely linked (you've probably heard the term *electromagnetism*, yes we physicists view them as two sides of the same coin). Maxwell combines their results into a set of laws called \"Maxwell's Equations.\" One of the equations implies that changes in a magnetic field create and electric field and vice-versa. One of the RESULTS of Maxwell's equations is that light travels at a constant speed, which we could now calculate with these equations. Now in come the quantum physicists of the early 20th Century. They realize that light is a just a propagating change in the electric and magnetic fields. So Einstein wonders, \"if light is just the electric and magnetic fields changing, what would happen if we 'ran' next to light at the same speed? We don't see the changes in the field (aka the light) and there should be no light when we run alongside it (this is a clumsy way of saying with words what he said with math).\" So Einstein is REALLY perplexed by this. Next he thinks \"If all the laws of physics were the same in all inertial frames back in Galileo's day, why shouldn't the same be true for Maxwell's equations.\" Remember that from Maxwell we can DERIVE the speed of light. So Einstein decides THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS A LAW OF THE UNIVERSE. That is, no matter how fast we move, light moves at the same speed! That takes a moment to digest so think about it. Say I'm running away from you at 5mph and you're standing still. A photon (light particle) runs between us; WE BOTH SEE IT MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED! Now what is speed? It is distance over time. You saw the photon move some distance X, I saw it move some distance that was more than X. But we saw it move at the same speed! How is that possible? If and only if a clock in my pocket was ticking slower than a clock in your pocket! Edit: Let me say explicitly, **the faster you are moving, the slower a clock moving at the same speed will tick.** Also, grammar. Physics man..."}]}

These stays aren't cinching in the waist at all, just encouraging proper posture. The clothing of the 19th and early 20th centuries do the same thing. It's much harder to slouch in a well fit suit coat than a t-shirt. But as mentioned by other posters, as you slouch your muscles change and it becomes easier to slouch. If you were to wear a pair of stays or a coat that pushes your body into the right position it will hurt for the first week or so. Not painful, but aching like you've been working out. And you have. The muscles across the chest are under-used when slouching as are the ones across the shoulders in back. After spending enough time in this posture it hurts to slouch.

During that time, the lungs double in size as air is drawn in, and the little fluid that is present in the now expanded lungs is reabsorbed into systemic circulation, and then peed out after the first couple of days of life. The lungs as such don't participate in oxygen exchange until after birth. Until then, the baby gets all the oxygen it needs from the umbilical cord that connects it to the mother."}]}

One suicide inducing another is called a suicide contagion. It works under a different mechanism than a copycat shooting. For people who are borderline suicidal, that drive to end it all is already there and what stops it from happening are certain barriers such as fear of pain, worry of affecting others, fear of death itself etc.\u2014all of those barriers keep the notion of suicide as abstract in the persons mind. Seeing another person commit suicide makes it real and therefore a tangible and plausible outcome for the suicidal person as well. Once thats the case they are much more likely to see it as a real option and go through with it as well. On the other hand, the human mind doesnt really have an innate drive to shoot other people\u2014its a conscious and emergent decision. As such weakening of a barrier doesnt necessarily make it more likely to happen\u2014there also needs to be specific desire to do so. For that reason you still see copycat behavior but its less about opening a flood gate against a pre-existing flood and more about directing the flood in a certain direction*should* a flood occur.

{"id": "1hho92", "input": "why is internet in America so expensive?", "output": [{"answer": "There are two big reasons: Infrastructure and Monopolies/greed. America is huge. Really huge. I hear it's hard for some Europeans to even comprehend its size, considering there's a couple STATES that all of England could fit into. From tip of Maine to coast of California is almost a week of driving 14+ hours/day, if not more. This means in order for a company to build up a strong network across the country takes a lot of time, manpower, and money. So it's hard for any new companies to form, because forming new infrastructure is a MASSIVE investment which takes a really long time to recover from. Why not just upgrade the existing infrastructure then? Well, that's where point two comes in. Because the infrastructure is so expensive, there's only so much of it to go around, and only a handful of companies big enough to manage it all. Comcast, AT & T, Verizon, to name a few, own the vast majority of the cables that make up the internet in America. The onus is on them to perform these upgrades. In fact, the government even gave them money to do just that. Instead of delivering on the promise of \"We'll take this money and build infrastructure\", they used some legal trickery to end up pocketing most of it, while not upgrading the networks nearly as much as they should have. So you've got these companies that own existing infrastructure that refuse to upgrade it. The market should dictate that someone willing to come in and perform those upgrades could compete, right? Well, turns out the cable companies have agreements in place where they won't compete in certain regions. In cases where they don't, they even get local governments to sign agreements saying they won't let their competitors come in and build new infrastructure to compete with them (usually in exchange for a few years of cheap rates for their community). So now you have existing, mediocre infrastructure with no way to compete against it without building an entirely new network. You can see how this monopoly would be hard to break. There's also a whole lot of politics involved. The FCC is in charge of managing communications networks in America, and they tend to be very hit or miss. I don't have a lot of details handy, but there's plenty of information out there if you're interested in how these companies are getting away with what they're doing. Pretty much our only hope of salvation at this point is Google. They're (slowly) building a fiber optic network, with speeds that far and away surpass even the most expensive consumer level plans at the other ISPs. It's not really clear at this point if their goal is to truly build a stronger internet for the whole country, or if they're just trying to scare ISPs into actually upgrading to speeds that are acceptable. In Googles eyes, I don't think they care, as long as the network improves, because a lot of their services (youtube, their data processing, etc) require high bandwidth that the current infrastructure can't really support. Personally, I hope to hell that they expand their fiber network across the country and we finally have real, true competition to shop from. Here's to hoping it's not just a pipe dream :/"}]}
{"id": "8045e9", "input": "Why does the color drain from our face when we\u2019re scared?", "output": [{"answer": "Our bodies basically have two \"modes\" a calm mode and an excited mode. The calm mode is when we're sitting down or eating. The excited mode is when we're excersising and moving a lot. The way our blood is distributed through our body is different for each mode. There's this thing called the fight or flight reaction that changes our body from the calm mode to the excited mode when we're afraid or angry. This comes from back when we lived in the wild. When we encounter a predator we'll either want to beat it upir run away, so we don't get eaten. And we need to go into the excited mode to do that the best we can. So what happens in excited mode? Less blood goes to our hands, feet and face. More blood goes to the big muscles in our arms and legs. The heart also starts pumping much faster.You don't need a lot of precise movement in these cases, just as much force as possible. So why does this happen when we're scared? It should be clear now.

{"id": "7kk3zy", "input": "- When does a body determine its dominant side? How does it do this and can it be changed with outside influences?", "output": [{"answer": "To answer the last question you asked, yes it can be changed with outside influences. Even after you have been right or left side dominant for years. The problem is that it's hard. Like near impossible hard. Let's say you are right handed, and want to become left handed. You have built up so much of a habit of using your right hand for all one handed tasks that your brain doesn't even think about which hand you should use when you do something, it just automatically starts with your right hand. Now of course there are tasks that some people do with their left hand when they are right handed for everything else, but for the most part that's more of a sign that right or left side dominance isn't unchangeable. You just need practice. If you learn a new thing you've never done before, like pitch a baseball, and you start with your left hand, after a while every time you pitch a baseball you will do so with your left hand without thinking about it. The reason why it's hard to become left handed instead of right in this example is that you have had years of conditioning your body to do all of these actions with your right hand, so to become left handed, you not only have to use your left hand for everything one handed that you learn in the future but also have to overwrite years of practice of the things you already know how to do with your right hand. While doable in theory, it's next to impossible in practice if you're not very young or slightly ambidextrous since young."}]}
{"id": "8cqgib", "input": "How do multiplayer online games play at the same speed?", "output": [{"answer": "So your internet data packets travel roughly 30% of the speed of light. That means, roughly 100,000 kilometers per second. So if you want to have ping of less than 20 ms, that is, 0.02 seconds, route from you to the server and back needs to be less than 0.02s * 100,000km/s = 2,000km. So if you live within 1000km of the server, you can achieve ping of 20ms, at least, in theory. There are some extra troubles here. Server can't respond to you instantly, it takes some time to figure out what kind of response you want. Also you have some processing to do on your end as well, drawing a single frame takes about 10 milliseconds from your gpu, and also non-gaming displays can have like 20ms delay between fame being ready to be shown on your computer, and the frame being actually shown. But anyhow, if you are within 1000km of the server, you should be seeing whatever server wants to show you within 0.1 seconds of you requesting this information. This to a human is almost unnoticeable delay. If the distance grows however, ping becomes more and more significant factor in causing delay, and at about 0.3s, it's very close to impossible to not notice this delay. So that's the basics of physics behind this. So how do games do this? A typical solution is that there is a central server, as before, which has something called \"tick rate\". Every tick, the server sends a packet describing what the server thinks the game world is like. Your computer then displays this world, and if you move or do something else in the game, your computer sends this data to server and once server receives your actions, it includes these in the next tick it composes. I know Valve games use tick rate of 64 ticks per second. Which is sort of nice, but if your actions have to go through server to be shown to you, this means there is distinct feeling of lack of control that can cause things like nausea if the delay between actions you make and these actions being shown on screen grows too large. So games typically cheat a bit. They try to guess what the server is thinking at the moment, and incorporate your own actions onto game world immediately. This means what you're being shown isn't actually the world as server tick describes it, but prediction like \"if the last tick was sent 15ms ago(taking network lag into account) and said the world looks like that, what would the game world look like now, 15ms later?\" So there are two closely linked game worlds your computer tries to keep in sync. Which usually works fine, but sometimes these worlds go off sync because of too much lag. This causes things like characters stuttering, warping around the map, things like that. But if everything works fine, your computer is able to make rather reasonable predictions about what's gonna happen next and these guesses and actual ticks stay in sync, so the game looks butter smooth to you even with about 100ms lag or something like that as game draws based on these predictions rather than waiting for server to confirm anything, and only after the fact it makes sure everything went as intended. If not, these sudden corrections are what cause warping, as your computer has to very fast fix position from predicted position to where the server tells that object actually is at. Lots of these kinds of corrections and everything just warps and stutters around your screen. With voice communications, lag can become much higher before you start noticing the delay. You probably would not notice 1 second delay on a voice chat that easily."}]}

Unfortunately, I do not have the ability to point in the direction I'm trying to indicate. And, unfortunately, neither you nor I have sense organs optimized to perceive the direction I'm trying to indicate. But if we had those abilities, I could point you in the right direction - right over there. You might consider reading *Flatland*. For a quick summary, imagine a 2-dimensional being - a square. It has no ability to point or look up or down because its limbs and sense organs are entirely 2-dimensional. Everything it knows and understands occupies this 2-dimensional plane. Now imagine a 3-dimensional being - a sphere - happily going through 3-dimensional space and it spots this cool 2-dimensional plane like a tabletop with lots of 2-dimensional shapes moving around \"on\" it. The sphere decides to pass through the plane just for fun and the square sees something very weird: a point that expands into a circle and then shrinks away to a point and then is gone. It's like magic. It makes no sense. Now the sphere decides it would be fun to pick up the square and lift it out of the plane it occupies. It does so and the square is aware only that the world has disappeared and been replaced to its sense organs as weird things never sensed before. Terrifying. Now the sphere tips the square. The square is suddenly able to see *inside* other 2-dimensional beings. As the tipping continues, the square sees its world in a series of cross sections and (perhaps) could be taught by the sphere to recognize friends, family members, buildings, trees, etc. So very, very bizarre. Now the sphere puts the square back on the plane where it was found and goes on its merry way up up and away. The square is left with a literally incredible experience. No ability to explain what just happened to it. Trying to indicate where it went and what it perceived is impossible - no one has language for the direction or perception. Now extend all this to a fourth dimension. A fifth. A sixth. There could be a 4-dimensional being \"hovering\" right \"over\" my shoulder watching me type this and looking inside me and this monitor... It might just decide it would be fun to pick me \"up\" and show me something I will be totally unable to describe to you afterwards. Even though all that happened is I went right over . . . there. Edit: Thank you so much, kind stranger, for the gold! Is there anything quite like the first time? Edit 2: Again, I really want to be clear that *Flatland* gets all the credit for this way of visualizing the problem. I just summed it up as ELI5 as I could."}]}

Why place something potential dangerous anywhere near civilization?", "output": [{"answer": "Not only is it impractical, its also (assuming no nuclear accidents occur) unnecessary because of safety precautions. The maximum allowed yearly equivalent dose of a radiation worker (UK) is 50% of what an average human recieves annually (from the ground and cosmic radiation). Power plants require large access to water, which they can only get from natural sources such as rivers/the sea. They also need to be able to put the water back. Don't worry, this water doesn't get irradiated, its only used for cooling and heat transfer. This and a close input to the power grid are what limits the location of a nuclear power plant. The problem is the possibility of accidents occuring, which we don't want to happen EVER, let alone around a large human population. So we take a lot of precautions. Accidents the size of Chernobyl can only really occur from ignoring procedures or in the case of chernobyl, messing about with the processes. At chernobyl they were testing something whilst at low power in an attempt to make it safer. The next most infamous accident is Fukushima. In Fukushima the calculated death rate was (I believe, im on mobile so i lack source) 0.5 people. What you really have to consider is the risk - for example, more people were harmed from the evacuation of Fukushima (due to the elderly being removed from their homes) than harmed by the radiation its self. Knowledge and research is our friend when trying to tame nuclear reactions. What we don't really have enough research on is the effect of radiation on humans - because only the japanese atomic bomb survivors are the only samples we have."}]}

{"id": "2xq0gc", "input": "How did companies like Google, Mozilla, or Yahoo originally make so much money?", "output": [{"answer": "Most of tech companies get Venture Capital money. Usually, the founders(s) build the product (i.e. Google, Yahoo, etc.) on their own time and once they show some promise, they go to Venture Capital firms such as Sequoia or Khosla Ventures and raise money. In very early stages, the founders might raise small amounts (generally  < $1M) from friends and family (rich ones!) or high net worth individuals. Usually getting a product of the ground, takes either time or money or some combo of the two. That's why many founders come from families that are well-off. Examples include, founders of Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Others, like Bezos of Amazon and the Whatsapp founders made some money in previous jobs. Most of these founders built the early stages of their products in small teams on lean budgets. Once you start getting Angel money then you try to hit your goals (number of users, or page views etc.) and so you can raise more money. Each time you raise money, it's called a round. The first major round is Series A, then B, and so on. In the case of many of the big successful companies, each subsequent round is considerably larger than the previous one. For example, Airbnb's Series A was $7.2M. It's Series B was $112M, Series C was $200M, and Series D was $475M. (Source: Crunchbase). Usually the money raised in the round comes from multiple investors. In the case of Airbnb's Series C, those investors were Crunchfund, Sequoia, Founders Fund, and Ashton Kutcher. The venture capital money helps pay salaries. Some companies are monetized very early, such as Airbnb which takes a transaction fee. Hence, they have another source of money. Others, like Pinterest are not. They depend mostly on Venture Capital. Anyway, essentially, the answer to your question is that there are rich people/institutions that are looking for places to park their money and get a good financial return. Hence, they give it to companies, which use that money for operations, salaries, etc. If all goes right, in a few years, the investors' money will be returned at many multiples (i.e. value will have been created)."}]}
{"id": "23217j", "input": "If bad posture is so bad, why does it feel so good?!", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of posters are saying that you need to work muscles to have aligned posture when this is actually NOT the case. \"Bad\" posture is caused by tension in the body's muscles, not lack of tension (or work) in certain muscles. A person with perfect alignment wouldn't have tensed muscles, but actually the opposite. The aim shouldn't be to tense muscles, but to release the tension that is causing the misalignment of your spine. It's important to remember that all the muscles in your body are \"connected\", in that muscles in your legs may overwork themselves to make up for unbalanced torso, etc. So although the problem may be in your upper back, to achieve better alignment you will actually have to release tension in your whole body. The first step to doing this is building an awareness of your body. Don't ignore the pain in your muscles. Be aware of stiffness and allow yourself to release the tension you are holding. An exercise I'd recommend trying requires only two small bouncy balls. First, lie on the floor. Next, without placing your feet but rather letting them hang and drop, bring your knees toward your body so that they are pointing towards the ceiling and your feet are resting on the ground. Make sure to now take a moment to assess how your body feels. Now, take the bouncy balls and place them under your upper back between your shoulder blades but NOT under your spine. You want the balls to be higher rather than lower along your shoulder blades. This might feel somewhat painful, but allow your muscles to release into the balls. What is happening is the muscles laying over the balls are releasing tension to accommodate their shape. Keep the balls under you for a few minutes, or however long you can handle, remember to breathe into the floor. Don't tense yourself either, but let yourself sink into the balls and the floor. Now, remove the balls. Stay on the floor and I guarantee you will feel an openness in your upper back. There are a lot of similar exercises, or \"preliminaries\" as they're sometimes called, for different muscles. A book I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone who lives in a body is The Body Has Its Reasons by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bertherat. It gives directions on how to perform many other preliminaries. There are also many touching and enlightening passages, but one that really struck me was about a old woman the teacher visited who had a very contorted spine and tense body. Days later, the teacher visited the woman and found her lying in bed with perfect alignment. She was dead. It makes the point that the body's natural state is perfect alignment, such as we have when we are born or when we are dead. The tension that we hold throughout our life cause the pain and discomfort that many of us live in. This is a little blurb about the book that gives you an idea: \"Your body has not forgotten anything. In the stiffness, in the inhibitions, in the muscular pains of your back, of your limbs, of your diaphragm and also of your face and genitals, your entire history is revealed, from birth to today. From the first months of your life, you have reacted to pressure: \u201cWatch your posture. Don\u2019t touch. Don\u2019t touch yourself. . .\u201d. You accommodated as best you could and in thus conforming, you deformed yourself. Liberate yourself from past programming.\" I learned this info and was recommended this book from a well renowned \"movement\" teacher who teaches at the acting school I used to attend."}]}

It is the idea that there are people who intentionally would like people to stop celebrating Christmas in public, because they believe that Christians should not be allowed to celebrate their beliefs publicly. It is called a \"war\" because the idea is that although right now, it is happening through legal action, it will eventually turn violent. Much of the \"evidence\" for this \"war\" comes from lawsuits that generally center around the use of *public funds for private religious events* such as nativity scenes or religious decorations on Christmas trees. It is actually not possible to get a private individual or business to take down any religious paraphernalia related to Christmas, because of the 1st Amendment. However, to keep life exciting for people, some individuals claim that lawsuits to keep public money from being spent on a statue of Jesus, is actually somehow a violation of free speech and part of the war on Christmas. Life is confusing for some people. The same goes for workplace rules. I live in the #1 city for atheists in the US and there's Christmas decorations and parties and tinsel all over the place. We have a ton of celebrations and a huge Christmas tree downtown. However, apparently the nominal inclusiveness aimed at assimilating everyone to the general culture calling it a holiday tree is a big war. I don't really think the people calling this war have been in a war before. Because having the mayor call a tree a holiday tree is actually nothing like getting your roof torn off by an RPG. But hey, life's boring, maybe by pretending to be in a war we can feel important! Employers can call their parties whatever the hell they want:  URL_0  Governments can't use public monies to sponsor a religious event. So when I worked for a government agency, we had a holiday party. Everyone wore green and red and gold, even people who celebrated Kwanzaa (and this was Seattle, and there were black people, and yes people celebrated Kwanzaa AND Christmas). But we just talked about the season, the non-snow, and the spirit of giving and forgiveness. Working for a private company with no government contracts we just had a Christmas party. Yes, Christmas. A bible verse was quoted. Because it's private. And you're allowed. So who fucking cares, this guy pays me, he's a great guy, his religious is his prerogative and it's not hostile because I would also be allowed to share my personal beliefs. So, that's the war on Christmas. A non-issue in which some people who were used to pilfering public coffers to support their personal religious ideology are being asked not to do so and therefore flipping the hell out and screaming \"war\"."}]}

Streaming royalties are great if you're an independent musician who can't expect to go platinum; they're basically found money if you only really sell 10k albums. But if you could make ten times as much from album sales as you could from streaming royalties, it makes sense that you would restrict streaming as much as possible. See this great infographic, which illustrates exactly how many streams a month an artist would need from each service to make a minimum wage monthly income:  URL_0  According to that math, an artist would need 4.05 million streams per month on spotify to make $1,160.

I won't go into what Convolutional Nets are, but will try to explain the rough idea: What you basically do is build a mathematical model which takes an black and white image, does some manipulations to it and could theoretically output a colorized version of it. The manipulations in the middle are of course what makes it work and will be something like: Take the brightness of the first pixel times some number, take the brightness of the second pixel times another number, ... add them all together and you got one pixel of the next layer. You apply this process on the new output pixels again and again until you got an output image. So the problem now is: how do you get those numbers? This is called an optimisation problem and one algorithm to solve it is gradient descent: You initialise the numbers (they are called weights) randomly, run the mathematical model on some training image and get some output. Of course, with random numbers that will look nothing like what you'd like it to. But because this was a training image you will have the correct solution and can compare it to what your random numbers produced. Now you tweak the numbers (weights) slightly, so that the output of the model will look slightly more like what it was supposed to produce. (This is done by basically subtracting the gradient/derivative of a loss function, which says how much the model is off, with respect to the weight.) We take another training image and repeat the process until the outputs are very close to the solutions. (It is important that we have very many training images or the algorithm will just 'memorize' the outputs.)

At the end of WWII, the remaining evidence regarding the Holocaust in Germany (that wasn't destroyed by the Nazis when they figured out they were going to be defeated) was effectively locked up \u2014 it was made accessible solely to academically credentialled researchers, in order to prevent it from being stolen, destroyed, gawked at, glorified, touristed, worshipped, etcetera. Germany took whatever steps they thought necessary to prevent Nazism from continuing \u2014 which included stamping it out from any sympathy or legitimacy. Which leads to: \u2022 Outlawing of non-academic criticism of the Holocaust and Nazism. It was a crime in Germany to question the official, academic account of the Holocaust, even when small amounts of evidence were debunked. This smells to many people like a cover-up of a fabricated story. \u2022 Lack of Germans willing to step forward publicly and claim that they witnessed part of the Holocaust. If one knew directly, firsthand of the crimes, and allowed them to happen \u2014 no-one *wants* to admit that. One could be prosecuted, be shunned, face retribution, be sued \u2026 Most people wanted to rebuild, not spend their lives wallowing in Hell. So there are very few survivors, very few survivors with direct knowledge, very few with any reason to speak out about it, very few with the academic credentials to do so. There is no money, and no academic legitimacy, in lending credence to holocaust deniers and treating them like their claims are legitimate, factually based, and worth addressing. Letting them set the agenda and decide what should be talked about in History and Academics regarding the Holocaust is effectively saying \"Okay, you may have a point, please make it.\" It lends a veneer of respectability, a colour of legitimacy that they haven't earned. So the historians and academics and most political bodies do nothing more than say \"well, babies poop their diapers too, but it isn't my job to wipe their bottoms.\" So the Holocaust deniers are effectively allowed to operate perpetuallyin an environment of drama \u2014 the same environment of drama that every cult and conspiracy research culture and underdog political movement operates in \u2014 the [Karpman Drama Triangle]( URL_0 ). There is a Persecutor, a Victim, and a Saviour. There is a struggle. This lends everyone involved a sense of purpose and meaning, and to many people, a sense of purpose and meaning for their life is much more important than treating others with fairness and respect, and the struggle is carefully calculated so it can never be resolved. That is their poopy diaper situation, which the academics decline to become involved in. The same narrative \u2014 that there is a Persecutor, a Victim, and a Saviour \u2014 was used very effectively by the Nazis in the first place, who cast the Jews as the Persecutor, the Germans as the Victims, and the Nazis as the Saviours. So of course, anyone buying that drama triangle must, by necessity, deny that the Jews were the victims of the Nazis, that the Nazis were the Persecutors, and that there was no saviour of the Jews. Even though the US and Britain and their allies knew of the Holocaust, and won the war, and Britain gave Palestinian territory to Israel to make a homeland for Jews that survived the war \u2014 there was no saviour.

Biologically, \"bad decisions related to food\" would be, like, eating a lightbulb. Which is not something people do when they're hungry. On the other hand, if you're wondering why you're prone to eating junk food (there goes that morality again) when you're especially hungry, it's because... you're hungry! Being hungry is a great excuse to let yourself out of whatever arbitrary rules you've set for yourself. And, yes, diets are, for the most part, arbitrary rules. You want to look a certain way, or see certain numbers (whether that's the size of your pants or your cholesterol test), or whatever, so you create rules for what you can eat in order to achieve those results. When you get really hungry, though, of course all that's going to go out the window. It's kind of like the way you're more likely to sleep through your alarm when you're tired, more likely to rationalize not using a condom when you *really* want to have sex with someone, etc. When the stakes are higher, we're going to have a harder time making ourselves do the less fun thing. Edit: I'd also add that a lot of \"bad\" foods are convenience foods. A lot of the time, we're hungry because we didn't get a chance to eat.

This is understandable because reddit firmly believes and will angrily defend the misunderstanding. You aren't raping a person by having sex with a drunk girl. What's rape is when a girl has had so much booze that she doesn't understand what is happening, can't make decisions at all, and is basically passed out. This means she is physically unable to consent because she doesn't understand she is having sex and couldn't say yes or no if you asked. People act like the law is that women can cry rape if they wake up and regret the beer goggles. This isn't the case. it's very clear when a person is too drunk to consent and more than that, long before you get to that point they are too drunk to have enjoyable sex, or for you to enjoy the sex (edit: More than you would with a sex doll). Most normal people wouldnt want to have sex wifh someone approaching that level. So really, if you aren't into having sex with immobile people the issue should never come up. So the answer to your question is, it depends on how you are defining you terms. As is, the woman is sexually assaulting a minor. If you're saying she's so drunk as to be unable to consent, then obviously she can not possibly be actively trying to have sex with the kid and so the kid is obviously raping her."}]}

The privatization of water.", "output": [{"answer": "If water becomes privatized basically it becomes a commodity like shoes, clothing brands, cars, etc. Only those who can afford it will have access. Now this isn't a big deal for most commodities, if you can't afford a pair of Nikes there is a cheap brand, knock off or warehouse sales for clothes, public transportation if you don't have a car but water is pretty different as it is literally essential to a healthy life, or any life at all for that matter. If water becomes privatized, it might not be an issue for 1st world citizens like us at first, though privatized water systems have infrastructure issues, most people would still be able to afford it at first though. In third world countries though, and eventually in 1st world, there will come a time where not everyone will be given access to water and this is when things will turn bad. I truly think that water will be the focus of some major conflicts in the relatively near future. This isn't some comfort issue, this isn't some superfluous need, this is water. You will fucking die in a day or two without any water and that's if it's clean. People have been rioting all over the world for far less, if you take away something so essential to life you can damn well be they'll fight for that. TL;DR War and in my opinion the possible destruction of society could result from the privatization of water."}]}

Edit: Since this has so much attention I just want to draw extra attention the the fact that this is not my post. I literally just copy-pasted from u/lallapalalable Go give them some upvotes instead. ------------------ Sort of true; days/months/years are kind of standard, but the concepts of seconds, minutes, and hours has a varied history. Sit back, I got home from work early and the adderall is flowin' so I wrote up a nice history of units of time: Early man tracked time day by day using apparent time, or time based on sundials and other observations of nature. I can't find too much info right now but as far as I can tell there was no standard unit of time shorter than a day among any major civilization for a while. The Egyptians defined hours as 1/12th of either day or night, and had seasonal variations on the length of their hour. Greek astronomers were the first to establish the modern hour, by dividing the day into six parts and then dividing those parts into four more. They also had an early version of the minute, which was how long it took for the sun to travel one degree along the sky, or about four minutes. The Babylonians went a little nuts, also dividing the day into six parts, but then divided each part by sixty for their sub-units, up to at least six subdivisions, the smallest individual units being as accurate as two microseconds. However, instead of using a 1/24th of a day hour like the Greeks, they had a 1/12th day hour (120 min), but did use the 1/360th day minute, and something resembling a second called the barelycorn, about 3.5 modern seconds and still used in the hebrew calendar today as the helek. In 1000, a Persian scholar named al-Biruni first termed the word second when he defined the period of time between two new moons as a figure of days, hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths. The minute was the first subdivision of the hour by 60, then the second, and so on. Roger Bacon did this again in the 1200's, but started with hours, giving a more accurate figure. The term third still exists in some languages, such as Polish, but fourths were apparently too small for any practical use and fell out of style with the general population. The late 1500s what the first time a true standard second came to being with the advent of mechanical clocks, so that the time could be measured objectively from mean-time instead of deriving it from the apparent-time. The first clock with a second hand was built between 1560-70and 1579 saw the first clock with actual markings denoting the seconds. However, they weren't very accurate, and the second remained arbitrary from machine to machine and unable to be reliably measured. In 1644 it was realized that a pendulum of a specific length would have an oscillation period of exactly two seconds, and by 1670 William Clement had tinkered with the physics enough to build a clock precise enough that the second was now an established unit of time. By 1862 it was established that the second would be the base unit of time for all scientific research, along with the millimeter and milligram, by The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), defining the second as 1/86,400th of a solar day by the 1940s. From there we've just been refining the accuracy of what we call a second, accounting for the Earth's axis and ever-so slowly declining rotational velocity, to the point where it's not even measured by observations based on the earth and sun, but by the distance light travels in a vacuum or how many vibrations a cesium atom makes. We've divided time so hard that to do so any further wouldn't make sense; events in subatomic physics just don't happen quickly enough for smaller units of time to be measured. But yeah, that's where we got our units of time. It's such a ubiquitous thing that we've had literally our entire existence to hash it all out, and while today we're all in agreement about the standard subdivisions and have been for a long time, there were discrepancies in the past and in the context of your post it must have been a special kind of frustrating trying to figure out what two people mean by \"hour\" *However, while we all agree on the day/hour/second situation, the annual calendar is still pretty sporadic in it's appearance. The lunar month may seem standard, but there are many South-East Asian cultures that have their own unique way of dividing the year. I won't get into that, because it's mostly a headache and I'm kinda losing steam on this anyway, but long story short we're far from having a universal system here."}]}

{"id": "14u8n1", "input": "Cisgender", "output": [{"answer": "I think that other people have done a good job of explaining what cisgender is (basically: not transgender), but nobody's touched on why it's a \"thing\". For one - if you're discussing transgendered people and gender identity, it's useful to have a words that means \"not transgendered\". So there's that. In any LGBT or GSM (gender and sexual minority) communities, it gets tossed around a lot, because it's relevant to the discussions they usually have. When you go about your daily life, there are certain things you probably take for granted. You take for granted that you have two working legs. You take for granted that you didn't stop growing at four feet tall. And that's not necessarily bad. But if you came across a person in a wheelchair, or a little person, you realize that those aren't true for everybody. And if you see them trying to maneuver a staircase, or order across a tall counter, you probably feel a bit sympathetic towards them. You might think that not everybody is made the same way, and that we should try to be accepting of people that are different. Well there's other things you probably take for granted. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume you're a cis male. What this means is that you look like a boy, and you feel like you're a boy, and you have the body of a boy. And there's nothing wrong with that - but that's not true for everybody. There are a lot of reasons for that. Sometimes somebody's brain disagrees with their body. Sometimes they aren't just one sex - sometimes babies are born intersexed, or a mix between male and female, and the doctor will pick one gender and use surgery to make the match - and years later, their brain might disagree with what the doctor chose. Sometimes people don't like defining themselves as just one gender or the other, particularly since men and women can be treated very differently. So how is life different for those people? Well, instead of pity or understanding, usually people like this are treated with fear or revulsion. One big example is with public restrooms. If you look and feel like a girl, then you can go to the girl's room, no worries. What if your body was different? What if people think you still look like a boy, and yell and say you're \"secretly a man\", and call you a pervert for \"trying to look like a woman\"? For transgendered people, this is something they always have to worry about. A lot of times, they have to be afraid of harm to their personal well-being, even the risk of being murdered. The idea of \"cis privilege\" is about assuming that everybody is cisgendered. Usually, it's tied to a lot of hurtful ideas - for example, that everybody *should* be cisgendered, or that trans people can just \"get over it\" or not be transgendered. This is about as helpful as telling a little person to \"just grow taller\". Oftentimes, people will feel that men \"should\" be one way and women \"should\" be the other. This is a damaging idea for everybody, not just trans people! What if a woman is discouraged from working in the field she loves, because it's assumed that she's dumb to do it because she's a woman? What if a man doesn't know how to cook or clean after himself, because he was taught that those were a woman's jobs? If a piece of clothing fits well and you think it looks cool, should you have to worry about whether it's \"for men\" or \"for women\"? If a guy wants to do a girly dance and pretend he's the opposite gender, is that any more evil than affecting an English accent and pretending he's a cartoon villain? So \"cis privilege\" also refers to the harmful idea that \"men are men, and women are women, and they have to be totally separate from each other, and nobody should be in between.\" One last thing to touch on: You mention seeing the term \"cis scum\". This is, basically, a joke that nobody really likes laughing at. Because cisgendered people are the majority, a trans person has to actually be afraid of any threats made against them. If somebody shouts \"die, tranny scum!\" at them, that's likely to be a very threat. \"Die cis scum\" only really exists in internet discussions. It's a joke, because everybody knows that, well, it doesn't mean much of anything. It exists to highlight the power inequality between transgendered people, and the cisgendered majority. Now, for the most part, trans people don't want anything too crazy. They want unisex public restrooms, they want to be able to legally change their gender if need be without too much hassle, and they want to not be murdered. **TL;DR: \"Cisgender\" means \"not transgender\". The word exists in order to ease discussion. Things can't get better for trans people without discussion happening first.**"}]}

{"id": "22vhmq", "input": "Why is christianity so opposed to homosexuality /how did this develop?", "output": [{"answer": "Like everyone else is saying, Christians are opposed to homosexuality because it says so in the Bible. First of all, it undermines the original design of humanity, with Adam and Eve. You see this in Leviticus, but maybe that stuff's too extreme and hardcore, which is understandable (maybe not the best context to use the term \"hardcore\", but we'll go with it). Even in the New Testament, we see Paul in his letters to the Church of Corinth and to the Romans, talking about how homosexual acts bring people away from God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Romans 1:26-28). However, I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide further insight, maybe biased, coming from a Christian. While the Bible does indeed state that homosexuality is a sin, one of Jesus' greatest commandments was to \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" The Ten Commandments state that anyone with hatred or anger commits murder in their heart. That being said, I believe that someone identifying as homosexual is no basis for being opposed to them. If anything, it is the opposite. Jesus showed no discrimination during his time on Earth in who he chose to help and heal. By nature, we are all sinners, none more or less than others, so there is no reason why homosexuals should be treated any differently, because we are all in need of the same saving grace that comes in Jesus Christ. Maybe I'm putting myself on the chopping block here, but I'd claim that a lot of the Christians you hear about who are protesting and rioting (ex: Westboro Baptist, but as /u/IvyGold reminded me, I'd definitely question even calling them a church. It's a very extreme example) have a bit of a twisted idea of the message of Christianity. Jesus' teachings, and the whole story of the gospel - that is, God sending his only son to die in our place - revolve around love. \"Faith, hope, and love. The greatest of these is love.\" (1 Corinthians 13:13). As a Christian, a follower of Jesus and a son of God, I would not be living as a Christian if I did not reflect the same love that God shows me when he saves. TL;DR: Christians are opposed to homosexuality, in the sense that the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin, and sin is bad, but Christians are the same broken and sinful people as everyone else, which means that Christians are not better people or on a higher level, and are out of place to judge people because of their sexuality. Edit: I apologize, that came out to be a lot longer than I anticipated. But I do hope that my words help shed some light. Edit: I suppose now I'm obligated to thank some people for the gold. So thanks! I'm sorry to say, however, that I have no clue what it does or what it allows me to do.

Historically, the US originally only had an army and a navy. Marines were/are technically part of the navy. With the invention of the air plane, both of these branches began using aircraft in combat. These early air forces were primarily focused on tactical air support -- supporting the army and marine corps infantry in particular battles and attacking enemy navies. It was ultimately recognized that air planes had strategic value for long range bombing that was far removed from any infantry activity and the army was slow to develop this facet of American air power because obviously their main concern was close air support for their infantry. Thus the Air Force was born. It's main purpose is to provide strategic (think long range) air superiority. Now come the politics. Hey the navy had planes before the Air Force came along! The Army invented air craft in combat! There is a lot of politics in the military with everyone jockeying to get the most influence and MONEY for their respective branches. So the navy, army, and marine corps have always been loathe to give up all of their air power. Their reticence does have some logic behind it which is where efficiency comes in. The military is incredibly bureaucratic and ponderous. So imagine a marine force trapped by enemy forces in need of close air support right FUCKING now. The steps it would take to get an air force pilot there would be extremely complicated. Paperwork, etc etc. Plus because of the politics the various branches don't really trust each other anyway, so it makes sense for the marines to have a small air force dedicated to close air support completely at the beck and call of marine command. Or imagine an air force pilot shot down behind enemy lines. It makes sense from a efficiency standpoint to have a small special operations force dedicated to search and rescue. These days the US military is far more integrated and cohesive, but now we're back to politics. No branch wants to give up any influence they have because of money. So we have a convoluted military where seamen, infantry, and air men all drive boats, conduct land operations, and fly planes."}]}

Usually, when a police officer is put on paid leave after a shooting, it's because he's under investigation, and it would be inappropriate for him to be actively working as a peace officer while an investigation is going on. However, he *still has not been convicted of or even necessarily charged with any crime at this time* because he's just being investigated. So they can't fire him because wrongdoing hasn't even been confirmed or denied, but neither can they allow him to continue to work. So that's why paid leave. Any other job, he'd just keep working until he either gets convicted and fired, or found not guilty and life goes on.

This justifies other peoples' answers here. The bulk general composition of the air will be the same (nitrogen and oxygen, mainly). 2. Despite the above, there are many more compounds and components in the air that have a very important role in both the perception of 'freshness' and the potential health impacts of being in contact with the air. Apart from things like humidity (i.e. water in gas form, dissolved in the air) and CO2, the large majority of the other compounds are cumulatively known as 'air pollutants', regardless of being harmful or not to humans.

For instance, one important pollutant is nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which originates from high-temperature combustion processes such as internal combustion engines in our cars, trucks, etc. Despite originating mainly outdoors, NO2 can still be problematic indoors, particularly in urban areas, because air will get in the house from the outside bringing with it its air pollutants. These will then be added to the pollutants that originate indoors, be it from people (yes, we emit a number of so called bioeffluents!), cooking, cleaning products, air-fresheners, perfumes, construction materials, furniture, and many other human activities. There are literally thousands of chemicals around us all the time, but the probability of these being present in higher concentrations indoors is higher due to an accumulation effect. This will only be exacerbated in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Regarding CO2, the average world level has now gone above the 400 ppm mark and levels indoors can frequently climb to over 1000 ppm. While this is not damaging to health, it is generally a good indicator of deficient ventilation in regards to a space occupancy. The main sources of CO2 indoors are people. You need a minimum amount of air renovation to dilute their exhaled CO2 along with many of the other bioeffluents. If CO2 levels are too high, then it is likely that you will also have high levels of many other compounds which will make the air feel heavy. The perception is particularly intense when someone comes into a room with these high levels. People in the space will generally not notice the gradual degradation of air quality in the space. Note that in many cities outdoor air quality can become very poor at times. Some Chinese and Indian cities have been particularly hit these past few years. In these cases, it is actually better for your health to stay inside and try to keep outdoor pollutants from getting in (i.e. do not open windows and refrain from opening doors too often). I have also read about the health impacts of going for a run or cycling in urban streets. When you exercise you inhale a lot more air and if you are doing it close to the tailpipes of cars and trucks, you will be absorbing very high loads of pollutants through your lungs. At the end of your exercise, you might actually have damaged more your health from breathing bad quality air than what you gained from exercising. Hope this helps."}]}

The per-day use price is very low.  > 2) It's one of the highest profit margins in the furniture industry.  > 3) It's impossible to comparison shop. The manufacturer's can, and often do, \"label\" the exact same bed with a different cover and name for two stores in the same market area.  > 4) The used market is practically non-existent. It's like selling your used underwear. Nobody wants your filth. So everyone buys new every time.  > 5) There are only a handful of suppliers for the basic ingredients for a mattress. Legget  &  Platt, for example, supply almost all the metal involved for the approximately 1,000 U.S. mattress companies. Latex is made by two major companies.  > 6) Consumers buy when they need, not when they want. This makes a mattress set more of a last minute purchase, than say a car.  > 7) There are limited sources online to understand the build of a mattress. Therefore consumers have no idea what they are sleeping on. Most people could not imagine a visual of what it would look like if they sliced their bed open. This is all good info, however there could be some debate about number 2 and 7. I know people who sell all manner of furniture and living room furniture seems to be the highest markup. There is a reason for these large margins though. It's expensive to run a furniture store, because it's a small volume market you have to have your store in a place that is easily visible to attract more customers; this means rent will be expensive. You also have to pay your sales people, they will take a fair chunk of your profit just for making the sale. You also will have at least two delivery drivers, a truck, any related maintenance. After all that and other expenses, you are gonna want some money to take home at the end of the day. So while the margins seem high upon initially looking at them, it's necessary to maintain business. Also there is a new trend where companies price map their products, meaning that they have to be sold at the MSRP. You're really expensive products(i.e. Tempur-pedic) is probably going to last significantly longer than the decade they are warranted for, therefore you won't see a lot of repeat customers and have to make your money on the first time around. Now on the other side of the topic, mattresses may not be expensive to make when looking at a single mattress, but when you look at the process of designing and tweaking it they become far more expensive. Because some beds have a couple years between prototype to retail model, there can be quite a bit of money sunk into a project by the time it actually hits floors. Then you take into account the massive advertising dollars spent and it continues to drive the wholesale price up. So there are good reasons why mattresses cost so much, not necessarily just the people selling them."}]}

{"id": "52etuy", "input": "What is exactly happening when someone is hallucinating? What is the brain doing?", "output": [{"answer": "Be warned: This is, in the spirit of ELI5, simplified a great deal. Many of your brain's sensory systems have 'levels'. Take, for example, the visual system. In the visual system, low levels might encode the presence of light in a particular part of your field of view. Neurons in higher levels might encode the presence of edges or corners in a particular part of your field of view. The next level up might put those together into a more cohesive shape. So, at the highest levels, you have neurons that encode relatively abstract things like \"dog\", instead of \"brown\" or \"furry\" or \"dog-sized\". Because of this, in order to hallucinate a dog, your brain doesn't need to accidentally activate the exact combination of mental \"pixels\" that form the image of a dog. Instead, if some \"dog\" neurons get activated, you're going to see a dog. Other neurons may not encode the presence not of objects, but of properties, or actions. So you might have a \"running\" neurons somewhere, a \"barking\" neuron, an \"angry\" neuron, a \"happy\" neuron... And so you can get more complex thing represented by just a few neurons. Activate the \"happy\", \"dog\", and \"running\" neurons, and you get a hallucination of a running dog, and you get the impression somehow that this dog is happy. Activate \"dog\", \"angry\", and \"barking\", and you have a hallucination of a dog barking at you, and you feel sure that they are *angry* barks. Now activate the \"angry\" neuron while looking at a lamp, and you may become rather convinced that the lamp is angry at you. Activate \"angry\" and \"menacing\" and \"predatory stalking motions\" while looking at the lamp, and you're going to probably hallucinate that the lamp is angry at you, it's dangerous, and it's going to come get you. Essentially, hallucinations occur when our mental representation of things get activated inappropriately. Normally, your mental representation of things like \"dog\" should only get activated when you actually see or hear (smell etc.) a dog, or when you are thinking about a dog abstractly / remembering a dog doing something / whatever. But if those mental representations get activated when there's no reason, then you might not know that they are not real, and you might automatically connect them to things you see around you."}]}

The oceans are colder the deeper you go partly because there's less and less sunlight, as others have mentioned. There's also cracks in the crust that give local hot areas as some said, which are kind of like underwater volcanoes. I'm not sure how accurate the \"4\u00b0C at high pressure\" bit is - I'd have to look at a phase diagram for water - but cold, dense water will still sink to the bottom.

I've given lectures at universities and museums on the history of beer. It's a fascinating topic that I love delving in to. If I go long my apologies, but beer is so important to our civilization. As has been stated several times in this thread, it's the reason why we became an agricultural society instead of just hunter/gatherers. It's the reason we have society. In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer. I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many. As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast). This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops. Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy. Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode. Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though. Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony. It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge. Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became. I can literally talk for hours on the subject. This is the cliffs notes version that I can pull from memory, I'd need to do more homework to get it down a bit more proper. But, until I can get paid for it, why the hell am I going to do it."}]}
{"id": "42j4eb", "input": "If I see 4 apples on the table, do I count them unconsciously or just recognize that there are 4?", "output": [{"answer": "Here's a great [comment]( URL_6 ) I found, all credit to /u/surfktizzle: The human mind has two systems for representing numbers: a [subitizing system for numbers up to four]( URL_4 ), and an approximate ratio estimation system for larger numbers. Your choice of the number \"five\" is interesting because it is right on the edge of the subitizing system's capabilities, but you are probably able to see that there are five without actually having to count them. Let's spell out the difference here to be clear. For numbers less than four, you can immediately tell precisely how many there are without having to count them (this is what the subitizing system does). For numbers larger than four you can only get an approximate estimate unless you count them (this is what the approximate number system does). The approximate number system [works like Weber's law, in terms of ratios]( URL_1 ). This means that you can discriminate say 90 from 100 and 900 from 1000 about equally easily because they are both a ratio of 9:10. Now to counting, which is actually a cool little invented trick that expands the capacity of the subitizing system by using language to precisely enumerate more than 4 objects (keep in mind you can't get a precise count of more than 4 objects without counting them). The way this trick works is as follows. We all memorize a verbal list of numbers that we store in long term memory (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). You may remember this being a big part of learning when you were 4 or 5 years old, and you can see that it isn't all that natural because it takes kids some time and effort to memorize this list. Now, once you have this list memorized, you can use the following counting algorithm to precisely enumerate more than 4 objects. You can then count the number of objects you're looking at by giving each a label from the memorized list of numbers, and continue this process until each object has a label, and has only one label. The label that you end at is the number of objects there are. So, let's say you had seven objects on a table, there are two ways you could precisely enumerate them. The first would be to create two groups of objects that are subitizable (say, identify one group of three objects, and one of four objects), process them immediately and then add them together. The other way would be to start labeling them from your list (the first gets the label \"one\", the second \"two\", and so on). Then you will run out of objects to label precisely at the label \"seven\" and you will know you have seven objects. If you wanted to count 90 objects though, you would be forced to run the counting algorithm because there is no way to break that up into a manageable number of subitizable sets (sets of four or less objects). When I first learned this it blew my mind, but if you think about it a little bit, you realize that is precisely what you are doing when enumerating some group of objects. You should notice that you can immediately recognize up to about four objects without counting (and can increase this with the little grouping trick I mentioned above, that I often use for numbers less than ten or so). However, notice that if you have to enumerate, say 17 objects, you probably won't be able to do so without the \"little voice in your head\", which you are using to recite your memorized list of numbers. This also explains how some cultures don't have number systems that go above two or three. All cultures have words that distinguish one object from multiple objects, but some stop there, or have counting systems that are something like \"one\", \"two\", \"many\". These cultures simply have not invented this linguistic counting trick because the need has not arisen, and this is not uncommon among hunter-gatherers and hunter-horticulturalists: they don't need to enumerate identical objects because most objects in the natural world can be identified individually because they are all unique. While counting seems incredibly natural to us, it is only because it is so well learned that we overlook how we got there in the first place, and so the idea that some people can get by without the counting trick can seem really odd to educated people. Interestingly, number systems seem to arise when the need arises, and specifically when people need to keep track of large numbers of roughly identical objects, or keep some record of the number for the future. When does this happen? Often with the invention of agriculture, since this often leads people to be trading, tracking, and exchanging larger numbers of nearly identical objects (e.g., bushels of wheat). This is why the counting trick has been independently invented many times over across many different cultures, yet has not been invented by all of them. For some cultures the need simply never arose. It is a little tricky to give sources for all of this because it is a broad summary of a ton of research, but here are some good places to start: Where Mathematics Comes From by Lakoff and Nunez Human Universals by Donald Brown Developmental psychology work on numerical cognition by [Elizabeth Spelke]( URL_8 ), and [Karen Wynn]( URL_2 ). Edit: Thanks for the comments and gold. I'm glad you all found this interesting. I would love to keep fielding questions here, but I should probably get back to doing real work. However, I did want to add a call out for anyone who knows more about this topic to post something on variation in subitizing ability. It seems like over half of the comments are asking about whether this can be greater than 4, and I don't know for sure or have a source off hand. My memory is that subitizing capacity does vary, but only around about 3-5, so you can't subitize much higher than that. If anyone can find a source for this please post it. Thanks. Edit 2: Looks like /u/svof posted a source on individual differences in subitization below. He points out that 4 is the modal subitization ability, which is a helpful elaboration. The general points hold, but there is more nuance in subitizing abilities than my answer implied. Edit 3: Wow, thanks everyone. I just wanted to add that there are other ways to assess the number of objects without counting them or subitizing them, for example by using a heuristic based on shape. Many comments/questions keep stating that people don't need to count higher numbers on dice or dominoes, and that is because you have memorized the shapes that the marks make, and how each shape relates to a specific number. So, there are other ways to figure out the number of objects, such as spatial heuristics, and I bet there are probably a lot of other work arounds one could come up with. The key to these work arounds would be figuring out visual stimuli that are immediately perceptible and map onto the number of objects somehow (e.g., like if every time there were 33 objects, they would be red, and only when there were 33 objects would they be red--then you could just instantly see the red and know there were 33 objects). Edit 4: Man did this blow up. Thanks for all the gold, and for the interest. I just wanted to add this edit to say that I probably won't be answering any more questions. If a unique one comes in, I'll try to respond, but almost every new comment/question is about one of the things I addressed in the post or the edits above (variation in subitizing ability, counting by subitizing in multiple groups, or counting by pattern recognition). Since I addressed those here, I'm not going to go through and answer each one over and over. One other common question is why four specifically, and I think /u/99trumpets [gave the best answer for this below]( URL_3 ). The last thing people keep asking about is subitizing savants (e.g., people that can instantly count 100 objects), and I just want to say I know nothing about that. I haven't seen a single credible source on it though, as everyone just references some vague thing they heard or Rain Man, so it's hard to tell if it is a real documented phenomenon or not. If someone does post a source on it, I'll add it in up here, otherwise I'm not really sure how to address that specific topic. Thanks again for reading, and I'm glad you all found this so interesting. Edit 5: /u/SirSoliloquy [built a cool little web app to demonstrate subitization.]( URL_0 ) [Check it out!]( URL_5 ) Edit 6: Radiolab did a segment on exactly this topic.

{"id": "1f71zp", "input": "What actual crimes did anyone on \"Wall St\" actually commit leading up to the financial crisis?", "output": [{"answer": "Most of what was done wasn't actually illegal, just breathtakingly irresponsible. For instance, there were (and still are) these things called \"synthetic CDOs\" that were similar to insurance policies like you'd get on your car or your house, with a couple of key differences. What the CDOs insured were (sometimes) collections of mortgages. So, like, when you got a mortgage from a bank or a company like Countrywide, the bank doesn't usually hold onto the mortgage for the full 30 years. Instead, they'd take your mortgage and bundle it together with a couple thousand other people's and sell the bundle to investors as a bond. The investors buying that bond expected to get (say) 5% or 6% interest for the life of the bond, funded by you and the other thousand people paying your monthly payment for 30y, or whatever. At the time, such investments were considered pretty darn safe. House prices always go up, right? HOWEVER, the people buying these things knew there was at least a small risk that the investment might not pay off--California might slide into the sea, or whatever. To guard against this, they sometimes went to big insurance companies like AIG to buy an insurance policy. If, for whatever reason, the bond *didn't* pay off at the expected rate, AIG would make up the loss. That was fine as far as it went, but here's the irresponsible part. In conventional insurance, you can't take out a policy on, say, your neighbor's house. Not so with this sort. Companies like AIG would write insurance policies AGAINST THE SAME BOND over and over and over for anyone who could afford the premiums. So, if the bond DID ever default, they would potentially be on the hook for many, many times what the original bond was worth--up to and past the point where some events (like a broad based decline in housing prices) could make the insurance company owe more than they could pay. That ended up being exactly what happened. When house prices declined, the people who had been counting on refinancing their house to make a balloon payment found that they owed more than the house was worth. They defaulted in record numbers, as did the bonds backed by their mortgages. AIG, to its surprise, found that it owed the people who had bought insurance on these bonds many, many billions of dollars. They were effectively bankrupt, until they were bailed out by U.S. taxpayers. Nobody (or not many people) did anything that was against the law, but a case could be made that they were very, very irresponsible indeed. Another huge problem was that in order to help Bush win reelection, Alan Greenspan opted to keep the federal funds rate lower than it had ever been for several years. This had the effect of flooding the U.S. economy with cheap loans. Because more people had more (borrowed) money to buy the same number of houses, starting around 2002 house prices began to rise. When, just after the 2004 election, Greenspan returned the interest rates to more normal levels, the growth came to a crashing halt. The bubble burst. Again, there was no law against doing this, but it was breathtakingly irresponsible. And there's really no doubt at all about what happened and why--Greenspan said so, in so many words, in his book The Age of Turbulence (published before the 2008 crisis). A little closer to home, you also had an epidemic of mortgage brokers turning a blind eye to obvious problems in order to get consumers approved for balloon loans to buy houses they couldn't realistically afford. Not (necessarily) illegal, but breathtakingly irresponsible. It's also true that nobody held a gun to anybody's head in 2004 and forced them to buy a McMansion that they couldn't really afford. TL; DR - In the U.S. financial system profits belong to the shareholders, but risk is for everyone."}]}

French/German Civil Code). judges have to go to 'judge school' and they sort of learn how to apply what the code says to the facts. so judicial precedent de jure doesn't bind them, and is not binding, because they are supposed to refer to the code rather than to other precedents (i.e. judgments) and then there is international law. international law doesn't really give rise to binding precedent, and they don't really have as comprehensive a code as civil law systems. however, they do have some kind of 'soft form stare decisis' - and this is in the name of certainty as well, so that Members can look to previous decisions by the dispute resolution bodies by which they can conduct themselves."}]}

These singers also more often have a 'thicker chord setting' that sounds beefy. Different harmonic partials, a darker or warmer tone etc. This is what gives that strong sound. Yes, other not-black singers can do this and sometimes will do it naturally or can learn to do it. And yes, there are of course black singers that have different voices. But you might be hearing the tonal changes that are associated with having strong muscle support. It would come across as warmer, fuller, richer sounding than someone who uses less muscle support when speaking."}]}

Unlike a car, which the lender will happily repo after ~60 days, repossessing a house, especially an owner-occupied one, is truly a last resort. There are tons of other options to explore if you just can't make your mortgage payment, ranging from loan modification to refinancing to a short sale or forbearance. Once you're about 60 days late your lender will start trying to work with you to figure out what's going on, long before they move to foreclosure, forced eviction, and then repossession. It's insanely complicated and expensive for them to do that, and there are tons of regulatory hurdles, so they really aren't in any hurry to do that unless they have to."}]}

These days you can easily get a multi gigabyte micro SD card in and out of even the most secure places without much trouble. Data security is very hard and the only reason we don't have even more leaks is because people don't want to put themselves at risk. Getting the data is pretty much the easy part. The hard part is finding someone willing to exfiltrate it and then leak it.

Shirts get dirty faster. Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross. A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat. You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction. You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell."}]}

Those bodies are typically influenced by more powerful nations. A central world currency would be subject to manipulation to the benefit of the powerful and to the detriment of nations already lacking influence. Control of a nation's currency results in tremendous power and responsibility. Being able to set their own inflation and interest rates can build a nation or bring it to it's knees. Giving up that control is not to be taken lightly. One only needs to look at Greece as an example of what happens if a country moves to a centralized currency shared with other countries before it's ready. With major economic and corruption issues, Greece was forced into default on it's loans. Another country may have been able to print more money, causing inflation, but it would have allowed it to pay it's bills at the expense of the buying power of it's citizens. Greece, however, was unable to print more Euros on demand as they would have been able to do if they still used Drachmas."}]}

Of the various dietary factors, gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of T1D. Rodent studies have supported this claim [24]. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of T1D. In the current study, we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the pro-diabetogenic properties of dietary gluten.\" Celiac is a life threatening response to gluten. However there isn't much science investigating the responses that aren't as pressing. There is something loosely called gluten intolerance, which is characterized by a host of symptoms including \"bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain. It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo, among many others.\" (from the wiki for gluten sensitivity). \"Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food.\" (from the celiac wiki) The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum, while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the same. To address your question.. Why do people go on a gluten free diet? Well, there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes. To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary, and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally. But nonetheless, often times the best way to determine if a dietary intervention will benefit you, is to implement it on a personal level and see what happens."}]}

First, labor is far cheaper in Asia than in the US. The cost of labor is about the same as the cost for fuel for airlines in the US, at around 30% of total airline costs. By contrast, it is usually around 15% for Asian airlines, with fuel being almost 40% of their costs. Second, many Asian airlines are state owned or heavily subsidized by the state. Those states recognize that bringing in people to spend money in their country benefits them. By contrast, airlines in the US are (mostly) privately owned and only benefit by taking you from place to place. Once you step off the plane, they don't get more money out of you until you get back on. Third, the people who fly on Asian airlines tend to be upper class citizens. A far smaller percentage of their population might fly somewhere, and those that do fly tend to be from the upper end of the classes. By contrast, people from a larger variety of the socioeconomic spectrum fly in the US. As such, the Asian airlines are dealing with different expectations of their customers (much like the US airlines did in the 1950s)."}]}

We only see them because there is a lot of thickness we have to see through. Some local turbulence caused by a plane isn't really a big deal because the rest of the thickness that we look through is preserved and untouched. Thought experiment for a moment: a screen on a window, by itself, doesn't really block vision. But if you put a bunch of screens stacked on top of eachother your vision starts to get blocked. Clouds are the same way. More specifically, according to  URL_0 , there is only about 0.5 grams of material per cubic meter in a cloud. For perspective: that's a few drops of water in a volume a little larger than your stove. Next time you're cooking, spit in a hot pan and spread out the vapor in the volume above your stove - that's about a cloud's density. After it spreads out even a little bit beyond your pan, it's probably in-perceivable in the relatively small volume. Lastly, and another way to think about it: why don't you make wake in ground-fog? I can't find exact numbers for some reason (probably because it's so variant) but my guess is that a good pea-soup fog is higher particle/vapor density than a cloud."}]}

{"id": "5a9i5t", "input": "What is that feeling when you randomly violently shiver, or when someone \"walks over your grave\"?", "output": [{"answer": "Myoclonus. I majored in psychology and I took a neurobiology class that implied that they were the result of feed back loops in your brain getting confused due to levels of serotonin and GABA . SO. Your nervous system is made up of a bunch of pathways. Some are designed to interact with the most basic parts of your brain (the brain stem ) and some others are designed to skip your brain entirely. The ones that skip your brain tend to work basically on reflexes (you feel your hand burn, you yank it away) . The catch is that these systems interact with the ones that go directly to your brain (so you can decide if it's safe or not) . These systems are CONSTANTLY talking to each other. This creates a series of feed back loops. Now serotonin and GABA are neuro transmitters (chemicals that control various functions of your brain basically) serotonin affects things like sleep, mood elevation and excitation. GABA is like all muscle control. Somewhere in the levels of neuro transmitters and those feed back loops your brain has a hiccup basically. Why? Well my textbook claims they still can't fully explain Edit: I'd expect low serotonin and an over excitation of GABA production would then make your brain think it was getting stronger signals and thus: shiver. This is wrong see later edit. Edit 2: Seritonin also affects you tempreture regulation which may add the \"cold\" feeling Edit 3: I should apologize. I stupidly reversed the actual function of GABA (it is inhibitory which means the more there is the less your muscles will twitch) I also want to add that if you are interested in this is gave you broad strokes. It IS genuinely more complex than that but hopefully this explanation helps you give a cool explanation to others. To those who say it's not what the OP is talking of from personal experience...I kinda want someone to collect data on the various descriptions of this phenomenon so that perhaps we can solidify the description. But my professor told me \"walking over your grave\" was a form of myoclonus some 2 years ago and I have stuck with that till new information comes to light.

{"id": "6ak3ij", "input": "Why do christians follow the King James bible when it was written 1600 years after Jesus?", "output": [{"answer": "The King James Bible wasn't written 1600 years after Jesus lived, it was *transcribed* from the different languages previous versions of the same book and put into English by the most learned linguistic scholars available to the king of England(not just Englishmen mind you, there were African scholars among them.) Back in the olden times schools weren't a thing, some rich folks had people to teach their kids but most folks didn't and so almost everyone was illiterate, they couldn't read. Because most were poor and nobody had cars, information, like languages, was very expensive to move around and teach people, because of this there were way more languages in a single area than there are today so in order for the early church to spread they couldn't just print out bibles for everyone to read, men had to travel across the land telling people about Jesus and his miracles, often they had to learn this new language then preach the gospel in that language to the people were they were and build a church there, keep a postal correspondence, pen pals. About 60 years after the death and resurrection it struck the leaders of the early church that they should write this down and that it would be easier to have one guy in charge of reading from one book to a bunch of people instead of sending men to places to teach an oral tradition. When they took to writing this book they used the languages which were common and which they knew. The Torah, the old testament, had been finished for hundreds of years by this point and it was written in Hebrew, the new testament had pars in Aramaic, the Jesus' first language, an off shoot of Hebrew, Greek as it was a common language after Alexander the great conquered so much of the world, and Latin which was the roman language it was becoming very popular at the time because the roman empire was expanding rapidly and and almost all of the events of the new testament happened within Rome's borders. After a time this early assembly of texts began spreading so far the none of those languages were known to the local population, so the early church decided to put together a Latin only version and to have all the priests and other people who read the book for others learn just that language and this sped up the spread of the religion even faster, it also helped people from all over Europe and north Africa communicate because the upper classes were all learning Latin themselves. There was a problem with this strategy of spreading the bible though, bad men could become book readers and lie about what it said for their own benefit and eventually the heads of the church began doing this. That made other people in the church very upset and so the church began to split up into new sects, one man named Martin Luther was largely responsible for the biggest split when he nailed a list of 95 grievances to the door the Castle Church in Wittenberg. It was out this act and many others that Protestantism was born, and the main labor of early protestants was to translate the bible out of Latin and into their own languages so the people could read and understand the words themselves. advancements in technology and trade had helped standardize languages over longer distances, the printing press had sped up the time it took to make a copy of a book from months and years to a matter of days. As early versions were being written people noticed certain things didn't translate very well and whole orders of monks, friars, vicars and other faithful and well learned men came to translate these books as accurately as possible. The reason we can trust a book that is so old to be accurate is because newer versions of the bible are a relatively new thing. The bible is the best selling and most printed book in world history that means almost every major publisher in the world wants to get in on that market and so many order a new translation to stir up a bit of media interest and to makes sure they hold all the rights to their unique translation, it is a very valid argument to say that the first and second king James versions are the most thoroughly researched versions of the English bible and does it's best to keep to a literal translation which results in certain things being hard to understand without context but it wont oversimplify the translation. It's also worth noting that modern translations have political purposes behind them in some cases. KJV first the have other versions at hand for quick contrast, a scoefield study bible paired with KJV is the best you can do though, it's the difference between knowing that Ham saw his father Noah naked and was cursed and knowing that the phrase\"To see/uncover your father's nakedness\" was an idiom or turn of phrase meant to express that you had slept with one of your father's wives. other versions may simply say Ham got his father drunk and undressed him and was cursed they don't leave the idiom in tact nor do they explain who cursed Ham, it wasn't God, it was Noah. I hope this helps, I really did my best to put this together so a young child could grasp it."}]}
{"id": "2shm05", "input": "In the lord of the rings, why do the orcs lose all the time even with numerical advantages?", "output": [{"answer": "Just based on the main battles of the Lord of the Rings, they are generally defeated either because of what's known as 'force multipliers' in military theory or just the fact that they may not actually be outnumbered. A force multiplier is something that makes a force many times more effective than it would be without it. I.e. a small force could do what it would normally take a much larger force to achieve. If we look at the battles at Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep/The Hornberg as the key battles of the lord of the rings, in both instances the good guys are holding highly defensible positions, allowing many waves of enemies to break against them with relatively minor casualties on the side of the good guys. We should also consider the fact that in both cases the defending forces are fighting not just for themselves, but to defend their homes and families, providing an incentive that the opposition does not have. While this defence obviously can't last forever, in both instances it does buy time for an additional, unexpected force to arrive. This is our second force multiplier (as well as just additional forces). The significant morale boost to the men at helm's deep at seeing Gandalf and Eomer arrive, and the men at Minas Tirith at seeing the Rohirrim, coupled with the dismay of the orcs in both cases, is an important turning point in the battles. Which brings us on to our third point; The Rohirrim. Or the force multiplier of superior weapons. The speed and skill of the mounted Rohirrim, facing a largely infantry-based foe allows them to sweep through many times their own number. I think this is more significant at Helm's deep where the forces of evil are entirely infantry, as opposed to the Mumakil (elephants) at Minas Tirith, but they are still important as in both cases it also allows for a two-pronged attack on the enemy's flank. Finally, I could point out that the good guys might not actually have been that outnumbered in the end. At Helm's deep the remainder of the orcs are finished off by Ents and huorns (trees) that have been sent to help. At Minas Tirith, Aragorn arrives with an army of the dead and other people to rout the orcs from the back. I can only think of two significant instances where the good guys are significantly outnumbered with no other factors in their favour. The first is at Osgiliath where Faramir is overwhelmed by a vastly superior force. Most of his men die and he nearly does as they retreat. The second is when they march out from Minas Tirith to bring the fight to the black gates. This is a fight they *expect* to lose. It's purpose is to distract Sauron's attention and forces to clear the way and buy time for Frodo and Sam to get to Mt. Doom. They are only saved when the ring is destroyed and the will that has been driving the evil forces crumbles."}]}
{"id": "6jw33w", "input": "how come software companies have to wait for hackers to find weaknesses in their system and not just figure it out themselves before rolling out a software package?", "output": [{"answer": "While everyone else here is going to give you broad answers, the difficulty involved, and much with the uttering of statistics and the doing of things, etc. The truth is more complicated. This is not a problem with security not being given due attention per-se, but rather a consequence of our field's lack of practicing good engineering. Let me explain from an example in a different field: Construction. On 9/11 two planes much larger than the engineers had ever foreseen crashed into them. Despite an event that critically wounded the tower, it remained upright for about half an hour. But they overbuilt the towers, they stayed up long enough for many to escape. The lessons learned from that collapse are now considered in future designs -- many planned skyscraper builds went back to the drawing board after, to be redesigned to account for this. Some of the very first laws in human history detail building codes -- \"If a builder buildeth a house, and it collapses and kills its owner, the builder shall be put to death.\" All of our buildings are built upon the knowledge of previous failures. Their designs are open to public inspection. There are libraries upon libraries filled with analysis and standards. All work (should) be inspected, and engineers cross-check with each other at every step of the design process, and even during construction. The towers stayed up as long as they did because humanity has had over 8,000 years of engineers learning how to build better buildings, and all of the lessons they have learned, we can learn today. In my field... none of this happens. Designs are black boxed, considered trademarked, trade secrets, copyrighted, patented -- the point is, most of our technology is most certainly not available for public inspection. Consequently, when it fails we learn nothing. So why not? Because corporations don't want to admit to wrongdoing, so they blame esoteric reasons far removed from this truth. And so our community learns nothing about the failure, cannot conduct a root cause analysis, and cannot share this information with anyone so our mistakes are learned from. Worse, we have to redesign things from scratch most usually every time. Our software isn't modular (like buildings are). We rarely incorporate well-tested previous designs. In fact, the industry is actively averse to using a proven design because by the time its proven, it's considered \"out of date\". Put another way: We reinvent the wheel with every new model of car. Because of all of these things, a person in our field, no matter how gifted, can only rise to the level of their own competence. They have no shoulders to stand on, and, being human, and unable to communicate with very many other humans for the aforementioned reasons, there are inevitably mistakes. This is why \"hackers\" will win in every contest. Security is only as strong as the weakest link, and with all of these problems, it's almost a statistical certainty they will find not just one, but very many. The problem isn't that companies design badly, or that they didn't invest enough in security. The problem is that no matter how much of an effort you make... it's *your* effort only, not the collective efforts of hundreds of thousands of people. And so we are left with things like cell phones that can catch fire and kill us. We're left with hospitals all over Europe right now that aren't functional because of a \"cyber attack\". Everything that has a microprocessor in it has bugs. And as our society becomes increasingly dependent on information systems, this problem will only increase exponentially. We don't need 8,000 years to fix these problems. Aviation is a relatively new field -- we only started a hundred years ago, and yet thanks to proper engineering *practice*, by applying first principles, it is now the safest way to fly. But until we start applying those principles, our technology will continue to with increasing frequency and severity. Security is defined properly as \"the computer doing what you want it to do, and not doing what you don't want it to do.\" Whether it's a hacker or an \"oops\" -- the end result is the same. And proper engineering would prevent both."}]}

These plates are known as the clutch, and you can imagine it like so: [Engine]---||---[Wheels] When cruising along normally, these plates are squished together (as above), and friction causes the spinning engine pole and plate to also spin the wheel plate and pole which obviously spins the wheels and makes the car go. When you press the clutch pedal in, it separates these plates so that the engine pole, although it may still be spinning, is no longer also making the wheel pole spin: [Engine]---| |---[Wheels] Importantly, you can make the engine rev and spin as much as you please with the clutch disengaged like this (to the point of blowing up the engine). When you 'drop/pop' the clutch, you are releasing your foot from the pedal suddenly, so that it returns ('drops/pops') to its normal position (in a very rough way), squashing the plates together, and causing the spinning engine pole to immediately transfer its movement to the wheel pole. You would do this for a couple reasons, as suggested - because you might want to have the engine be producing power in advance of needing it, and then deliver it all at once (as in a drag race), or you might want to stall the car to turn it off (so that instead of the engine's motion transferring to the wheels, the wheels lack of motion transfers to the engine). Alternatively, if your engine will not go but you can get the wheels spinning (by rolling the car down a hill), it is possible to jump start some cars by dropping the clutch and thus reversing the normal pattern of behaviour, by transferring the wheel's motion to the engine, and (hopefully) making the engine work normally and start using fuel to continue spinning."}]}

There was a time before it only cost $10 for a digital scale to keep in your kitchen. In that time, most recipes were made using volume measurements. In addition, the butter churning process ends with setting your butter in a container to solidify again. If you have your 1-cup measures that you pour it into to let solidify, then you already have 1 cup of butter measured. In more modern times, sticks of butter are a known size. A pound of butter is 2 cups, and a stick of butter is half a cup. These can be portioned off as needed for smaller measures."}]}

Because people from Europe and Africa tend to have differently shaped faces, studying people with mixed ancestry increased the chances of finding genetic variants affecting facial structure. Kayser's study had looked for genes that affected the relative positions of nine facial \"landmarks\", including the middle of each eyeball and the tip of the nose. By contrast, Claes and Shriver superimposed a mesh of more than 7000 points onto the scanned 3D images and recorded the precise location of each point. They also developed a statistical model to consider how genes, sex and racial ancestry affect the position of these points and therefore the overall shape of the face. Next the researchers tested each of the volunteers for 76 genetic variants in genes that were already known to cause facial abnormalities when mutated. They reasoned that normal variation in genes that can cause such problems might have a subtle effect on the shape of the face. After using their model to control for the effects of sex and ancestry, they found 24 variants in 20 different genes that seemed to be useful predictors of facial shape (PLoS Genetics, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004224).\" and the original research  URL_2  a graph is worth a thousand words  URL_3 "}]}

Why the sudden outburst of rage?", "output": [{"answer": "You know how animals that feel threatened can suddenly become uncontrollably aggressive when they're cornered? Basically, loss of temper is that as applied to human beings. Living things are motivated by their survival instincts, and this is greatly influenced by the Fight or Flight response. This is the process by which the brain decides whether to flee from danger, or turn aggressive and fight it. Stress is the brain and body's response to feeling endangered. It is your biology priming itself for a potential Flight or a potential Fight. Beyond a certain stress threshold, the brain becomes like a cornered animal - no way out from the dangerous situation, so the only option left is to fight. This is where \"loss of temper\" comes in. The brain treats things like rationality and reason to be superfluous in a fight to the death, and so these things are switched off. All your resources are directed into making you as scary and as physically aggressive as possible, in order to beat whatever it is that has you cornered. People that experience a loss of control, or can't recall their actions, do so because the parts of their brain responsible for that has shut down to save resources and give you more punching power. This is also why people with anger issues show much more physical strength and power when they have lost their temper, and why they can be so dangerous to those around them. This is great all if your biggest cause of stress is the risk of being eaten by a bear or crushed by a hippo, but it doesn't translate well into modern society. The brain does not have a means of distinguishing between the kind of threats faced by our ancient, primitive ancestors and social and economic factors that cause us stress today, and it reacts to both in the same way."}]}

From what I can tell about Germany, immigrants are usually alienated by putting them somewhere in the outskirts and leaving them to themselves. They get little financial support but that's about it. \"Integrating\" isn't usually easy if you don't even get the chance to visit a language course as they can't pay for them themselves and the government doesn't really seem to care. Once the immigrants move into their new homes they are usually surrounded with other immigrants. They know little or nothing about the life in Europe and usually stick to the people with a similar cultural background and who speak a language they can communicate in. So the Muslims \"not willing to integrate\" don't even get a real chance and often Germans don't even want them to integrate because they don't want to have to deal with \"foreigners\" anyway. In Germany we even have something called \"Residenzpflicht\" for some immigrants which means that they are only allowed to move in a certain radius and if they leave that radius they commit a criminal offense. So even if they tried to get to know their new country they can't even get outside the town they live in. So all this then leads to districts where Muslim immigrants are kept to themselves and build up their own habitat, including things like Mosques. Of course they have it harder to learn the language because they don't really need to know German when they are surrounded by people who all speak Turkish or Arabic or some sort of mix between those two and German. It is basically a vicious circle for them because the conditions they have to live in are very poor and there are very few jobs and the educational system fails entirely. Getting out of those \"Ghettos\" isn't easy as well because they face institutionalized racism (from police and other government agencies to landlords who won't rent their apartments to immigrants) pretty much everywhere and just don't get the money to get out of these conditions. That of course leads to problems like criminality, drugs, prostitution etc. And although many people have been put in those situations politics and media did a great job making THEM the scapegoats. So what you now have is major parts of Europe blaming most of the national problems on Muslims and their unwillingness to adapt to a living in Europe. And since it is a popularizing issue some political parties of course jump the bandwagon more or less successfully (in the Netherlands for example [Geert Wilders]( URL_0 ) right-wing populist party PVV). What happens now is simply immigrants being fed up with their situation, tired of being treated as second class citizens and not been given a chance that their frustration can turn into violence. People too long didn't give a shit about those people's problems and needs and now they wonder that the immigrants are frustrated and won't adapt. Also, many people here don't seem to understand that \"integration\" is a reciprocal act and not just \"them\" living how \"we\" want them to. People are only fine with foreign culture if it benefits them directly (like Kebab houses, cheap kiosks or water pipes) but if they don't benefit they go crazy and think that the Muslims want to turn their country into a sharia state and everything that has got to to with Islam seems an imminent threat. Of course there are plenty more aspects but I think this should suffice for now. I just wanted to give you another perspective away from Muslim demonising."}]}

{"id": "lm3is", "input": "How Credit Scores Are Determined", "output": [{"answer": "I work in a semi-related field, so I think I can answer this decently. There are these three places that keep track of everyone's ability to pay their bills on time. They are called [credit bureaus]( URL_0 ). In the US, they are called Equifax, Transunion and Experian. There are more, but these are the biggest three. Whenever you make a payment on time on your student loan, car loan, credit card, etc, that payment is reported to at least one of those bureaus. Each bureau will assign you a score based on how well you're doing. When you apply for a new credit card, the bank will ask those bureaus how good you are at paying your bills so they can decide if they want to take the chance that you'll pay them back. If your score is good, say 750, they will give you a credit card with a lower interest rate and a higher credit limit, because you have proven yourself to be trustworthy. However, if you've been late on payments to other banks or you've decided to no longer pay your debts, the credit bureaus will lower your score. Anything below 600 is considered very bad. If you apply for a credit card with a score in the low 600s or lower, they will approve you with a higher interest rate and a lower credit limit, because they are taking a risk by lending to you. They may even decide you're too risky to lend to, and decline you. There are ways to recover from a really low credit score, but it generally takes a lot of time. There are a lot of bad people out there who try to tell people with low scores that they can help, but they're really just trying to scam you. Generally, if you resume making regular payments on your debts, your score will start to slowly rise. If you get a credit card and pay the balance in full each month, that is also a good way to raise your credit score. There's obviously more too it, but it's explain like I'm five, so hopefully that helps."}]}

Drive down the road at 30 mph with the window down, and despite the fact that air is now moving past your vehicle at 30 mph, it should be fairly quiet. Stick your hand out the window, with your palm flat down, and it's still mostly quiet. Turn your hand and cup it and now you can feel the force of the wind blowing by and probably hear the turbulence. Same air speed, radically different sound levels. Moving air isn't loud, but it has the potential to create a lot of noise, especially when you put something it its path to create turbulence. Something like the inlet and outlet grates on a hair dryer. Or a curly heating element. All of these can be designed to reduce sound levels, but that requires research and design. It requires more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive materials. In addition to the moving air, the stuff that makes the air move can also create noise. A cheap little motor will cause vibrations, some of which you can hear. These vibrations can be minimized through balancing and damping, but that requires research and design. It requires more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive materials. A cheap little fan blade will create waste noise, which is noise that's just associated with spinning the fan, but doesn't contribute to moving air in the desired direction. This waste noise can also be reduced, but that requires research and design. It requires more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive materials. You can't buy a quiet hairdryer, yet.

As someone who cares little for Internet points, I will step through the minefield to try to shed some light on the complexity of the answer for you. Those who have a vested interest in advancing the claims against evolution are usually in a poor position to grasp the science of their arguments. The deck is stacked against them, unfortunately: they have probably had a lifetime of people espousing junk science to further religious indoctrination goals. By the time they've reached an age where they can reason for themselves, they are already looking for ways to stay in the dark, versus ways to help illuminate their understanding of complex concepts (incidentally, this is where you separate yourself from that pack, and congratulations on attempting to educate yourself). Without implying that better education correlates with atheism, I'll simply say that religious tenets do not survive the use of logic and reason, when an open mind is properly applying these tools. Sadly, the *actual* answers to some of these pseudo-scientific questions are above the heads of many who are asking them. If you were to go to Ask Science and post a similarly-worded inquiry, you might not understand the answer (I know that my brain would have some trouble wrapping around what they're going to spit back at you, and I've got an undergraduate physics education!).

The fact is we all have some form of belief system, for some that takes the form of a religion, for others it might be a political viewpoint or a set of assumptions about how the world works.

If we take, for example, film stars etc. we've got people who have suddenly experienced a massive shift in the rules and norms that they are expected to follow. They've gone from ordinary person to celebrity and what the world expects of them, and what they expect of the world has changed dramatically, their place in society has massively changed and it's hard to deal with. There's a term for this disconnect - anomie. Scientology, like a lot of belief systems offers answers and structure so I guess for some people it provides them with a way of dealing with that change. Similarly, a lot of uni students often find some sort of belief system. This is due in part to that removal and upheaval of social norms and what is expected of them."}]}

{"id": "1ihljt", "input": "Why does the word 'liberal' refer to the left in the US?", "output": [{"answer": "I disagree with a few here. I mostly see it as definitions being flipped every once in awhile as opinions change and the parties with liberal/conservative/progressive labeling change with them. The lack of a real socialist movement caused a lot of that in the early 1900's and later in the 50s. But, for example, the Democratic part held the south for a LONG time and for awhile was the party of segregation; the longest serving Democrat in the house up until 2010 was in the freaking Clan. All the major democrats of the era were stalwart segregationists : Strom Thurmond, John C. Stennis, Carl Vinson. And then the party was led in a new direction in the 60s/70s by a different sect of the party aka Kennedy, LBJ, Carter. That's how we got to our current definition today. Republicans today are a big difference between the Republican party of Teddy Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln or even before that Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republican party. That party, in a weird irony, lines itself with what would be considered modern Republican ideals (less government), but is the forerunner to the Democratic Party. US history has a lot of big moments where the two party system basically flip flopped their ideals to stay relevant in whatever was going on at the time. The civil war was one, communism's rise was another, and the Cold war caused another. The segregation issue with the Democratic party is the best example of one party doing a complete 180 simply to appease changing opinions. In actuality all are some form of what would be, in the rest of the world, a centrist or liberal viewpoint with neither aligning with a \"right\" or \"left\" political stance. But Democrats can be very very conservative on certain issues. For example, gun rights are an extremely liberal viewpoint historically. But the Republicans' support of the patriot act is horrifying to anyone against big government. If we were to have a two part system divided equally on issues purely on right leaning values (more government = more problems) and left values (more government to help) it would be the Libertarian party and the progressive element of the Democratic party."}]}

Launching nuclear weapons is not a matter of firing one and then waiting around for 30 minutes while another one is loaded into the tube. A nuclear war is not a back and forth gun battle where you slowly whittle down the opposition until one side surrenders or is eliminated. It's an all or nothing exchange, like two men in a pistol duel only they stand 3 feet apart and can't miss. In a nuclear war nations fire many nuclear weapons (in just about any case *all* their weapons) at pretty much the same time. Those weapons, mostly intercontinental ballistic missiles these days, take about 30 minutes to fly up into space, go around the world and then come back down on their target. That means that another nation would expect to get some warning of an attack in which case they launch all of *their* weapons. The missiles cross paths at some point and then both nations, and likely the world, are destroyed. So why not just fire one or two nukes instead of all of them? Imagine there is some war, like Russia attacking Poland. The US decides to respond by launching a single nuke at the advancing Russian army. This raises the stakes and the Russians now respond by launching 5 nukes to take out all of the major US staging bases in Europe. So the US responds with 50 nukes and so on. This is called escalation and it's pretty much the only thing possible when nukes are involved. Of couse all of that escalation theory was figured out from day one of the cold war. And so everyone realized that the only viable \"winning\" move is to jump immediately to the fire everything step. If the enemy launches one nuke, you launch 1000 and hope that a miracle happens and he can't respond in time (rather then the alternative where you both escalate a few nukes at a time, in which case there is a 100% chance he will be able to respond to the final doomsday exchange and everyone dies)."}]}
{"id": "4mpjf1", "input": "Why do we crave sweet foods after a regular meal? Why is the idea of desserts quite universal among cultures?", "output": [{"answer": "The physiological basis for this revolves around insulin, as some others have mentioned. When the carbs in your meal are broken down to sugar (glucose) by your digestive tract, they flow through the blood to the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that is secreted from the pancreas when this sugar is detected in the blood. The main function of insulin is this: it tells CELLS in your body \"HEY THERES SUGAR EAT IT ALL UP.\" This is different from the cravings you feel, and happens on a cellular level. What happens when a 'regular meal' is eaten depends on the meal and the person, but I'll take an extreme case to demonstrate the point: a low carb meal and an obese or overweight person. In such a situation, the body is already conditioned to expect certain chemical contents, most importantly high carbohydrate content. When the amount of sugar in the meal is less than the body is conditioned to expect, the amount of insulin secreted for that one meal is higher than is necessary. This is because when the pancreas begins to detect sugar (from digestion of carbs) in the blood, it releases the same amount of insulin. This can be thought of like a peer pressure situation involving the other hormones. One hormone that responds to the stomach being stretched after ingestion, along with some others that detect protein content, induce stomach emptying, etc all work together to create a holistic \"digestion response.\" The pancreas jumps on board and secretes its usual amount. So, what happens when theres too much insulin released and not enough sugar? your cells are like \"wtf bro you lied theres no sugar here\" and the overwhelming response to your brain goes something like this: \"eat something really sugary\" Another key to this pathway is that if the pancreas continually releases more insulin than is needed (as in, you start habitually eating less carbs), eventually your cravings will reduce. Your body will adjust to expect 'healthier' things and wont be secreting high levels of insulin that correspond to high carbohydrate meals. This is generally a good idea because overworking your pancreas with high insulin secretion for years and years can lead to diabetes. So all the anecdotal evidence that suggests that some people dont respond this way is interesting. Genetic differences of course play a role, however, if you are raised with 'regular meals' all your life, then your pancreas releases insulin accordingly, and there is minimal excess that tells your brain to eat something sugary. Whats particularly interesting to me is the comment about cheese following dinner. Cheese is particularly high in another type of sugar, lactose. This would be worthy of investigation to see if these people have cravings for dairy after a 'regular meal' as discussed here."}]}

A diode pumped solid state green laser uses an 808nm laser diode and two different crystals to produce coherent green light. The first Crystal pushes the light further into the infrared too to produce light at 1064nm wavelength. The 2nd Crystal is a frequency doubling medium which cuts the wavelength in half, resulting in green light with a wavelength of 532nm. Self levelling green lasers have been around much longer than direct diode green lasers have been around. So to answer OPs question, the more expensive self levelling green lasers that likely used dpss(crystals) green lasers are very difficult and time consuming to produce with any precision. A cheap green dpss laser pointer like this one:  URL_0  is thrown together as quickly as possible and the laser beam being emitted may be \"off\" by as much as 20\u00b0, and depending on the quality control of the manufacturer, could be the size of a tennis ball at 100 feet.

For a high quality and precise green dpss laser, it would take higher quality lenses and crystals, and it would have to be tuned and calibrated manually by the manufacturer in order to produce a laser beam that is aligned properly and doesn't expand(diverge) too much. Direct diode green lasers are coming down in price, so the price of red versus green self levelling lasers could even out in the next few years, but likely won't because of greed."}]}
{"id": "3rhat2", "input": "Why do Most Heisman trophy winners not do well in the NFL?", "output": [{"answer": "The simple answer is that college football and NFL football are almost completely different games. Therefore, having success in college football is not a great predictor of one's success in pro football. You might be wondering, why are college football and NFL football completely different games? This answer is more complex, but basically it boils down to player talent. Let's start with the numbers. There are something like 250 Division I college football programs, each with ~100 players - That's 25,000 division 1 college football players. The NFL only drafts 256 players every year - roughly 1% of active division 1 college football players. So the players in the NFL are at least the top 1% of college football players (a lot of the players who get drafted never see the field or get relegated to the practice squad for their entire careers). Therefore, most of the people playing college football are physically closer to you and me than they are to anyone in the NFL. This lack of physical skills gives way to a certain style of football. If a team is lucky enough (or has recruited well enough) to have players with NFL skillsets, then that team can simply overpower their opposition. I hypothesize that this is why the running game has become so prevalent at the college level. Certain teams and certain programs that can recruit really well don't put really any emphasis on skill players and just get big bodied guys who can run the read option. This practice has become so commonplace that college football more closely resembles track and field with tackling than it does pro football. Obviously you still have programs that have stuck with pro-style offenses, but they are getting fewer and further between. Some examples are Michigan State, UCLA, Memphis (this year with Paxton Lynch) and Michigan. As coaches face firing, pressure builds to \"win now.\" In college football, \"winning now\" often involves switching over to the read option - see USC under Sarkisian (now fired) this year. The move to read option works because the offense is simple and there is basically no learning curve - most high schools run the read option these days. The only issue is recruiting. So if college football has turned into track and field with tackling and the Heisman trophy winner is the best college football player, then what is he good at? He's most likely good at running the read option and hasn't learned any plays more complex than a zone read. If he's a quarterback, he probably never learned how to read a complex defense or even a quarter of the plays he's going to need to know at the pro level. Generally speaking, the guys who win the Heisman are often naturally more gifted than most of their competition and they rely heavily on that to win games. You see it every Saturday: Houston QB (an example) fumbles the handoff, but he jukes 6 guys who are 5'9\" 180 lbs and runs for 25 yards. In the NFL that play never happens. When these Heisman guys get to the NFL it's a big shock. No longer are they the biggest, fastest guy on the field who can run around and buy time to throw downfield (or just run for 20 every play). Instead they have to learn the playbook, diagnose the defense, understand a pro style offense, allow themselves to check down on plays, etc. Sadly, they have to learn how to play football for the first time in their careers. Examples: Reggie Bush - At USC was always faster than everyone else, could just run around them. Took him 5 years to learn how to really play football and be an effective RB in New Orleans. Tebow - A spread offense QB who was surrounded by 10 other NFL caliber athletes at Florida. RG3 - Another Spread Offense QB who was always faster than everyone else. It worked in the NFL for about 10 games. One knee injury later, he's done. Manziel - Should have stayed in College Station one more year to really learn the offense. The running around and \"extending the play\" thing hasn't worked very well in the NFL. Also it invites injury."}]}

The odds of a tornado touching down on a house and not a corn field are slim. Many of the towns and homes that dot the wide open farm land are from the late 1800's and most brick structures are important civic buildings or schools due to cost. Tornadoes don't care if a building is made with the finest brick or cheapest pressed wood, in the end it eats what it wants to unless it's an earth home. Earth homes seem to be the bane of tornadoes but nobody wants to bury their 100 year old home stead yet. Architect's have more to think of when building on the SC coast not just because of the hurricane but also the swamps. The swamps love to give full body hugs to heavy structures. Most buildings really close to the ocean are stucco, brick, or hardie-plank and put up on huge stilts or foundation HOWEVER, some places like Charleston have historical buildings that can't be messed and still have wood. Many of the cheaper more inland buildings have a brick veneer on the first floor and a slab foundation but homes close to the swamps are small and built of wood due to sinking (well, that's what I was told by locals). The SC government has tax breaks put in to help home owners make hurricane improvements too but none are for brick that I know of just working shutters, roofs, windows/ doors... you get the idea."}]}

The JPEG, for the Joint Photographic Experts Group that designed it, format was specifically designed for storing photographic (or at least photorealistic) images that had a lot of colors with gradient transitions - if you're using it for anything else you're probably using it wrong. PNG was created to be a replacement for the GIF format which was optimized for images with a limited number of colors with sharp edges/contrasts - things like line-art or logos. PNGs now have a large enough color palate that the number of available colors might be enough to represent a photograph (certainly better than GIF allows), but the encoding algorithm isn't optimized for the type of image that photography gets you. A more apt comparison might be between JPEG and something like the RAW format - keeping the comparison between file formats that were designed for the same purpose (photography) but the lossless one trades off file size for the image fidelity."}]}
{"id": "4hmve0", "input": "Whenever a wound recovers, like from surgery, how does the blood vessels around the area connect itself to their right counterparts on the other side of the wound?", "output": [{"answer": "The VEGF answer is a good one, however it's important to note that many simpler molecules play roles in directing blood vessels to areas that have become ischemic (or in lay-terms, lost their blood supply), and they are produced as a direct consequence of the ischemic tissue losing its blood supply. For example there is an increase in potassium around cells that have lost their blood supply, because their blood supply is also their oxygen supply, and these cells need oxygen to maintain the high concentration of potassium within the cell. When they lose their blood/oxygen supply, the potassium leaks out of the cell increasing the potassium concentration around these cells. Similarly, when cells lose their blood/oxygen supply, they can no longer undergo aerobic (or oxygen-dependent) metabolism, and they must switch to anaerobic (or oxygen-independent) metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid (or the burn in your muscles when you exercise), and this decreases the pH (or increases the proton concentration) in the area around these cells. The potassium and the protons diffuse away from these cells and a concentration gradient forms (think how a smell is weaker the further you are away from its source, but becomes stronger the closer you get). The cells that form new blood vessels are attracted to this increase in potassium and proton concentration and they grow toward it. Thus, the byproducts (potassium and lactate) of cells losing their blood/oxygen supply attract the growth of new vessels, and once these cells have their blood/oxygen supply back, they no longer produce these byproducts and the concentration gradient collapses, and the cell population no longer attracts blood vessels. The body has magnificently elegant solutions to its own problems."}]}
{"id": "21xza3", "input": "Why is it we go into a state of \"feeling low\" for no apparent reason sometimes and how does it pass away?", "output": [{"answer": "How is your diet? That is the first thing that comes to my mind when I hear this question. What is a good diet constructed of? A number of important things: Sufficient fiber. This means plenty of vegetables, some fruit, nuts, perhaps some dried fruit. Fiber keeps the digestion system running comfortably and efficiently. By eating plenty of vegetables for fiber you are also getting vitamins that you need to feel your best. Plenty of water. Staying hydrated is very important to feeling at your best. Avoid soda. Soda contains salt which is added by manufacturers to dehydrate you so that you want to drink more soda. They have to add a lot of sugar to mask the salt content. Sugar spikes your blood sugar quickly and then it crashes making you feel tired within a few hours. Sufficient protein. Protein makes you stronger. Your muscles need protein to recover and stay strong after daily use. Remember your heart is a muscle. Meat and fish contain complete protein as does dairy and whey protein powder. If you want to avoid meat you need to combine foods such as rice and beans to get complete protein. Meat also contains vitamin B12 which is particularly important for giving you energy. Vegetarians need to supplement B12. Most people need between 50 and 100 grams of protein a day. People who are weight training often eat much more than 100 grams a day. Addressing food intolerances. People can be intolerant to different foods. If you have a food tolerance, avoiding that food can make an enormous positive difference in how you feel. Certain food intolerances can cause a low feeling. Some examples of food intolerances are dairy, eggs, wheat and soy. There is a lot of information online about food intolerances. If you want help finding whether you have a food intolerance a dietician (nutritionist) or doctor can help you. Sufficient dietary fat. To function properly most bodies need 25-35% dietary fat as a percentage of daily calories. Dietary fat gives long lasting, steady energy throughout the day. Dietary fat is needed to absorb vitamins A, D, E, K, and carotenoids. Each gram of fat has 9 calories, each gram of carbohydrates and protein have 4 calories. Your body needs dietary fat for brain development, controlling inflammation, digestion and blood clotting. Good sources of dietary fat are meat, fish, dairy, nuts, avocados, olive oil, butter. Remember that body fat is a function of total calories and level of exercise and is not the same thing as dietary fat. The fat you get from food are called essential because your body cannot make them itself, or work without them. Dietary fat adds satiety and a sense of fullness after eating a meal and also affects hormone levels. All your cells are defined by fat molecules aligned as a membrane. Dietary fat is needed to provide central building blocks to all cells in the body. Sufficient carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy. Complex carbohydrates found in rice, grains, potatoes and starchy vegetables digest more slowly and give longer lasting energy. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate. Sugar will spike your blood sugar and then you will crash. Some sugar is a nice part of a diet but too much and you will not feel your best. Too much sugar has also been linked to a number of diseases later in life. Most people need between 100 and 300 grams of carbohydrates a day and often more. If you are exercising a lot you will need to eat more carbohydrates. Sufficient vitamin D. Your body generates vitamin D naturally when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Spend 10-15 minutes outside in the middle of a sunny day with exposed skin to get vitamin D. This is difficult to do in the winter because often it will be overcast for weeks. Take advantage of the sun in the spring and summer by spending time outside to restore your vitamin D."}]}
{"id": "4iy7or", "input": "How is that wine bypasses any expiration dates and essentially gets \"better\" as it ages?", "output": [{"answer": "Most spoilage occurs due to either rancidity, or microbial growth. Wine contains essentially zero fats, so rancidity isn't an issue. And as far as microbes go, there are very few of them that can tolerate ethanol concentrations anywhere near what's in wine. One of the few that can is yeast, which is what was used to make the wine in the first place. One of the others is a group of little critters referred to as acetobacteria, because they like to eat ethanol and make acetic acid, vinegar. So, if you do get a wine that's been contaminated with a microbe that will digest it, it will in fact go bad and turn into wine vinegar. Now, as far as aged wine being better, that depends. A lot of wines are still made using wild fermentation techniques, which means that the yeast they use isn't from some named and predictable package, it just happens to be whatever was floating around the vinter's yard that day or hanging out on the skins of the grapes. Those wild yeast can make some really awesome flavors. Or some really terrible ones. Fortunately, most of the terrible flavors tend to be rather unstable. So if you allow the wine to just sit around in a cool to slightly warm area (25*C would be pushing it), the unstable compounds will break down and the flavors will mellow. If you get it too hot, the wine will basically cook and too much of the flavor will disappear. If you keep it too cold, the wine will take a very long time to age and some of the nasty flavors will probably never disappear. You also want some of those ostensibly unpleasant flavors to stick around. They help provide complexity to the flavor profile and can balance out any residual sweetness from sugars that the yeast didn't convert into alcohol. This means that there's a sweet spot in the age of a wine where it's at it's best. When this range is will depend on the wine. Sweeter whites tend to peak in a few months, as they have a lot of residual sweetness and very little tannin to balance it. Dry reds tend to peak in a few years, since they have a lot of tannin and very little sugar to balance it."}]}

It's important to understand that while a single gene mutation can make a cell cancerous, dangerous malignant cancers will have at least four or five mutations that they've developed over time. *Cells can repair most DNA mutations before they can do any damage. The body actually has a number of redundant [repair mechanisms] ( URL_0 ). Often the first step towards a cell becoming malignant is a mutation, or series of mutations, that disables these repair mechanisms. The cell then accumulates more mutations that make it cancerous. *If a cell's DNA becomes irreparably damaged, that will often trigger a self-destruct sequence called [apoptosis] ( URL_1 ). Often malignant cancer cells will have a mutation that disables the apoptosis mechanisms. *If a cancerous cell doesn't self-destruct, the job falls to the very aptly-named Killer T-cells, a special type of [white blood cell] ( URL_2 ) that identify cancerous or infected cells and blow them up. They can trigger a cell's apoptosis mechanism, or release cell-killing enzymes. Often the body has inflammatory reactions to cancer tumours too (the same way it reacts to an infected cut) but that's just not enough to keep it from growing."}]}

Much of the sound produced in the report of a gunshot is produced fron the rapid expansion of hot gasses leaving the muzzle of the barrel. The suppressor serves to trap these gasses within a series of baffles, lessening the sound. Bear in mind that you will not find many suppressors creating the 'hollywood' quiet sound that we're so used to. In fact, it can still be quite loud. Especially if you're using supersonic ammunition (subsonic ammunition is a must for eliminating the supersonic crack - but will often have reduced ballistic performance). The proper term is suppressor, as these devices only serve to suppress or muffle the sound. \"Silencer\" is actually a trademark of a company called Silenco that produces suppressors. To add a little more, baffle strikes can result in a catastrophic failure of the suppressor. When using a bullet that is too heavy to be stabilized by the twist rate of the barrel, the bullet can actually hit the baffles, destroying the suppressor. This can also be caused by improper threading, where the suppressor, when mounted, is ever so slightly canted."}]}

But in science and engineering, the disadvantages are legion. Converting units and dimensional analysis in metric systems are a snap, but in English units they are a nightmare, at least for me (I'm an engineer, btw). I'm American, and I far prefer to do calculations in imperial and convert back to imperial at the end. It's just easier. Probably my biggest peeve about the imperial system is the slug. The imperial unit for mass, the slug, is basically a formality, and most engineering texts use the concept of pound-mass, where they just take something's weight and divide by gravity, as most things are measured in pounds, not slugs. This may not sound like a big problem, but what it results in is that EVERY SINGLE EQUATION has an errant gravity constant (or lack of one, or one squared, etc) that is different that what I learned, and am used to using. So, when studying for my professional engineering test, every single equation had two variants: Imperial and metric. Thankfully, the PE test took answers in both forms, so I just used metric. Maybe it's just me, but I HATE working with imperial units. I wish we'd get on with the rest of the world and move on to metric, if only for the sake of science and engineering."}]}

What we think happened is that as the sun was forming, it acquired a spin and that spin ended up transferring to the cloud of material, shaping it into a disc which eventually would collect together to form the planets. Without this spin, the material would have just fallen into the sun and it would have burned a little bit brighter."}]}
{"id": "8hfd2h", "input": "How does \"intentional\" cognitive functions like thinking and memorization happen within the brain's cells?", "output": [{"answer": "Well, there are a bunch of things that work together when you decide to do something. You need to learn about all of these parts and how they work together. The first part you need to learn about is the thalamus. The thalamus is the part that first gets vision from your eyes, sound from your ears, smell from your nose, taste from your tongue and feelings of touch from all over your body. It also gets messages about your balance and whether or not you're moving from a little organ in your ear. The thalamus organizes these senses and sends them to other parts of the brain, on the edges, called lobes, but it doesn't send all of them! It has little switches that either turn on or off based on how much power the senses have. For example, when we see movement it usually turns on more switches than the other stuff that we see which stands still. Because the brain can only send so many messages at a time, only the stuff that turns on a lot of switches will be sent out. It's sort of the same for smell and the other senses. Something that smells really good will turn on a lot of switches. That's why, for example, even though your nose is on all day, you don't notice it until someone starts cooking dinner. The switches are turning on, but way more switches are being turned on by stuff you are seeing or feeling. Now we understand the first part played by the thalamus. After it sends out the powerful sensations to the lobes, the lobes go into action. The lobes also have a bunch of switches, but their switches organize in a different way. They turn on if the sensations have certain qualities. For example, when you see an object that is moving, there are some switches that turn on if the thing has edges and other switches that turn on if the thing has a face. These switches are different than the switches in the thalamus, because even if they are off they don't stop the signal. For example, you don't stop seeing a baseball even though baseballs don't have faces, you just know that it's not an animal. All the different lobes for the different senses do this if the thalamus sends them sensations. When they figure out the qualities of the stuff that is sensed, they then send the senses to parts of another part of the brain: the hippocampus (hippocampus is greek for seahorse because it's a part of the brain that is shaped like a little seahorse!). The hippocampus also has a bunch of switches. These switches make up what we call memory. Here, in the hippocampus, the senses that have been chosen for their power in the thalamus and organized by their qualities in the lobes are checked by memory. If the pattern of on and off switches that they came from matches patterns of on and off switches in the hippocampus, we call it remembering! If they don't match patterns that we know, the hippocampus takes those patterns of on and off switches and leaves them alone for the future. If it keeps getting the pattern of something it doesn't remember, the pattern becomes a part of it. Now, when it gets the pattern, it will remember it. This is how a lot of memories work, though not all of them. You remember things like how to ride a bike in a different way. We're not going to talk about that today, because I have a lot of chores to do besides explaining all of this. For now, only one type of memory will have to be enough. Now, you want to now about how we decide to remember, and we will get to that, but first you need to understand that we remember stuff whether we want to or not. When we decide to remember, we still do the same thing, but we decide what we focus our senses on. If we want to remember some new words, we might look at the new words on paper and read them over and over. This makes the new pattern in the hippocampus, but have you ever noticed that it's hard to learn when there is a bunch of noisy people around? That's because the thalamus is still sending senses based on what the power of what our eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin sense. If there is too much sound or bad smells, the stuff that we want to remember won't make it to the hippocampus. The other stuff will. This still hasn't answered your question, though. In order to answer your question we have to learn about another part of the brain: the prefrontal lobes. The prefrontal lobes have two main parts: a left and right side. The left side arranges words it has in patterns from the hippocampus in ways that that the hippocampus also has stored in patterns. For example, we know that a sentence in English needs a subject and verb. This is a pattern, and it's also stored in the form of a pattern. I know, this is getting really complicated, but hang in there. These words and the patterns about how we can arrange them help the left prefrontal cortex consider stuff. How do they do that? Well, this is sort of a tricky thing: the patterns of patterns are connected to other patterns, called associations, so that your memory of the word dog and your memories of dogs usually show themselves to the prefrontal cortex at the same time. Your memories of experiences with dogs, though, might show up in the right side of the prefrontal cortex. The two sides are doing different things, but they talk to each other about what they are doing so that they stay coordinated. If, for example, you were ever scared by a dog, the right side might make sure that the left side doesn't make word patterns that say all dogs are nice. In this way, the two sides work together to make stories up about what could happen, what is happening, and what has happened. If these stories are strong enough, they can go into the hippocampus as patterns of patterns too. Sometimes these two sides of the brain work in a different way. Sometimes the right side makes up images, smells, tastes, feelings and sounds, and the left side tries to make up sentences to describe it. We call this imagination. Sometimes we imagine something that we want but that hasn't happened, and the left part of the brain figures out a pattern that explains how to make it happen. For example, if I imagine a casserole, the left and right side might work together by trying to remember the list of words that has all the ingredients and the memory of whether or not I have them. Now you are starting to understand how all the switches work, but we haven't talked about the switches in the prefrontal cortex. That's because we don't really understand how all of those work together. Maybe the thalamus just sends us the powerful sensations, and then the rest of the parts figure out what to do according to what we remember. For example, if we get hunger senses, the hippocampus might just send patterns about hunger to the prefrontal cortex, which will then check the hippocampus for memories about what to do when you're hungry. When it does this, it might also have other things that it is working on, so it might focus on those instead. The truth is that this part of how the brain works is even more complicated! The switches turn on and off, but they aren't exactly like the switches in either the hippocampus, the other lobes, or the thalamus. They are similar in that they have switches that turn on and off, but they turn on and off based on sending messages back and forth with different parts of the brain constantly, including other switches that are also in the prefrontal cortex. I can't really explain that part very well yet."}]}

I was a federal cop for 5 years so I've seen both sides of the body camera 'movement'. The citizens who are forcing the issue of body cameras see them as a means to catch cops doing the wrong thing which on the surface makes totals sense, but when you dig into the subject a little deeper that argument for support starts to fall apart. Employers have been monitoring their employees since the invention of closed circuit TV. Almost everywhere you go there are cameras watching both the customers and the employees...but mostly the employees. The average employee isn't bothered by this because they would never do something wrong, a handful of employees are dissuaded from trying anything on camera but if they find a weak spot they'll exploit it, and a select few don't care about the cameras and gamble that nobody is watching. The same goes for body cameras. There are over 900,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the US and the overwhelmingly vast majority of them will spend their entire career faithfully serving the public with honor, dignity, and respect with some of them selflessly and heroically giving their live in the process. A handful of cops would be dissuaded from doing something questionable on camera but would exploit a weakness in the system if they found one, and a select few just want to watch the world burn. The numbers for \"bad\" cops are no different than the numbers for \"bad\" doctors, \"bad\" lawyers, or any other profession. Some people just suck and they choose a variety of different professions to fund their suck ass lives. So now you win and all 900,000+ cops are outfitted with body cameras and dash cams. But most of the cops would never do anything wrong and now they've got these cameras with them all the time. So what exactly are the camera's purpose? They become evidence gathering tools against you and you can't just think about today, you have to consider the technological advances of the future. If we mandated 100% body camera compliance tomorrow, within five years every cop would be a walking talking license plate reader/facial recognition computer. In ten years we'd have cameras on every street corner and on the highways because \"why pay cops to pull over speeders when you can just send them a ticket in the mail? Cops are needed for real crimes.\" You also have to take into account what this would do to our criminal justice system. When television shows like CSI became popular it had a measurable effect on the system that has been labeled [The CSI Effect:]( URL_0 )  > The CSI effect is hypothesized to affect verdicts in two main ways: first, that jurors expect more forensic evidence than is available or necessary, resulting in a higher rate of acquittal when such evidence is absent; and second, that jurors have greater confidence in forensic and particularly DNA evidence than is warranted, resulting in a higher rate of conviction when such evidence is present. While these and other effects may be caused by crime shows, the most commonly reported effect is that jurors are wrongly acquitting defendants despite overwhelming evidence of guilt. In particular, prosecutors have reported feeling pressured to provide DNA evidence even when eyewitness testimony is available. In one highly publicized incident, Los Angeles County, California District Attorney Steve Cooley blamed actor Robert Blake's acquittal on murder charges on the CSI effect. Cooley noted that the not guilty verdict came despite two witness accounts of Blake's guilt, and claimed that the jury members were \"incredibly stupid\". In a world where every cop has a body and dash camera, anything that happens off camera might as well have never happened. The solution to that? Cameras everywhere!! The result? Hello 1984."}]}

It's too complicated to easily summarize, but in a nutshell, a spaceship has to use its engines (or something else, see below) to speed up and slow down in order to change orbits. It transitions from Earth orbit to an orbit that's free of Earth and going around the sun, and it must enter an orbit around Mars or Venus, essentially matching their orbits around the sun. In addition to engines, there's the possibility of using Mars's thin and Venus's horrifyingly thick atmosphere for aerobraking to help slow down and \"capture\" into orbit around the planet, so it's possible to do slowdowns like this without engines. However, it does mean lugging a heat shield around. You can see [this delta-V chart]( URL_0 ), which works like a subway map. The numbers next to each leg are like the fare one must pay to cover that leg. Legs with the red arrow mean that aerobraking is possible, so maybe you don't have to pay the full amount (which is paid in fuel and engine-wear). From a raw numbers standpoint, one can get to the surface of Mars and back for about the same deltaV that one gets from to the *orbit* of Venus*. That big 27 next to Venus is what it takes to get from the surface of Venus to orbit around Venus-- 27 km/s, or roughly 3 times the delta-V of getting from the Earth's surface to Earth orbit. Of course, you bring a much smaller ship to Venus than you do from Earth, and there are tricks, like using balloons to carry the ship up before it takes off, and such. But it's way more complicated than a trip to Mars, where people can walk around outside and spaceships won't be crushed and all that. TL;DR: Earth is moving at 67,000 mph around the sun. Venus is moving at 78,000 mph around the sun. Mars moves at 54,000 mph around the sun. A rocket must use engines to change the speed at which it goes around the sun, and we're talking 11,000 (V) vs 13,000 (M) miles per hour difference. Considering how much easier Mars is to be around in all the other ways, the energy difference is chump-change. Edit: typos"}]}

If you're on a satellite phone and calling someone else on a satellite phone on the same satellite there is a 0.25 second lag in each direction. When you stop speaking they'll hear you stop speaking 0.25 seconds later, begin their reply, and you'll hear it 0.25 seconds later, leading to an extra half second before you hear them reply. If it has to go phone-satellite-base station-satellite-phone then there is a full second of lag, the signal will have travelled 256,000 kilometers! This is undesirable for standard users Your standard cell signal travels a few kilometers to a tower then on fiber then to a tower then to the phone. The circumference of the Earth is 40,000 km, even with crappy routing you won't force the signal to travel more than 80,000 round trip for a worst case lag of just 0.3 seconds if you call someone as far away as possible.

{"id": "2brrav", "input": "Why don't we see clearly without goggles underwater?", "output": [{"answer": "Our eyes are \"calibrated\" for the index of refraction in air. When a ray of light passes from air into the lens of our eye, the change in the index of refraction of air to that of the lens bends it just the right amount to focus it properly on your retina. The amount of bend is determined by the difference in the index of refraction between the two mediums (air and lens) . Because water has a different index of refraction, when light passes from water into your lens the lens doesn't bend the light enough to focus properly on your retina. Goggles fix this by letting the light transition from water to a little bit of air through a flat surface, which minimizes distortion from that change. Then the light proceeds to your eyeball through the normal air-lens transition, and everything looks good."}]}

{"id": "3jbthf", "input": "Ethics vs Morals", "output": [{"answer": "Let me explain it as clearly and concisely as I can. Ethics is the value-theoretical study of the good. This contrasts it with aesthetics, the value-theoretical study of the beautiful. It also contrasts it with fields such as epistemology (the study of knowledge) and metaphysics (the study of reality), which are not value-theoretical at all (that is, they do not concern themselves with issues of value, such as \"better\", \"worse\", etc). You'll often hear that ethics is the study of justified action or something like that, but this is a misleading characterisation of ethics. While this is a true statement about ethical theories such as consequentialism (which judges actions solely based on their consequences) and deontology (which judges actions based on duties they adhere to, principles they follow, or other such things, and maybe consequences as well depending on the specific theory), it is not true about virtue-centred ethical theories, in which the central focus is on the agent's character rather than on their actions. Nor is it true about care-centred ethical theories, in which the focus is on relationships between people (again, less about specific actions here). Of course, both virtue and care ethics can recommend courses of action, but that is not their central focus. Morality, on the other hand, is something else. It's a subset of ethical thought, sure, but beyond that, it's a nebulously-at-best defined term. This is why it's not used quite as much in formal contexts. It can mean one of several things. For example, when we say \"morality\", we could be referring to the common ethical rules of a particular group of people - their common morality. Ever heard of \"social mores\"? Well, this is it. On the other hand, \"morality\" can be used to mean something roughly equivalent to spiritual purity. There's often a sense that contravening morals in some way taints the agent. On the third hand, some draw the distinction at the place of other-regarding considerations (thinking about other people). For example, a character-centred virtue theorist may say that it is ethically desirable to have a great deal self-control. But this is often not in the field of morality because it often has nothing to do with other people, but just with you, the subject. This same virtue-theorist may say that generosity, for example, being an other-regarding virtue lands within the field of morality. I'd avoid the use of a term like \"morality\" without a solid definition, because it can mean so many differen things to different people."}]}
{"id": "6roka4", "input": "Why is everyone that pleads \"not guilty\" in a court case, but later found guilty, not also given a perjury charge (along with their initial charges)?", "output": [{"answer": "In the US you aren't required to incriminate yourself; it's the prosecutor's job to prove you are guilty. You have an initial arraignment, at which the charges against you are established, your rights are explained to you, and you submit your plea. If you say you are guilty, the case goes straight to sentencing. If you say you are not guilty, you get your day in court. A 'guilty' plea doesn't necessarily mean you are guilty; it means you accept the fact that the prosecutors *do* have enough evidence to convince a jury that you are guilty. A 'not guilty' plea doesn't necessarily mean you are not guilty; it means you *do not* accept the fact that the prosecutors will be able to convince a jury that you did everything you are accused of. Since there is often a laundry-list of charges sought against you, 'not guilty' might just mean that you don't believe that they will be able to make some *specific* charge stick, even if you are found guilty of the rest of the charges. If you plead guilty at the arraignment, you are accepting everything you are charged with up-front as a package deal. So if you think that while you are technically guilty of breaking the law there are extenuating circumstances, and believe that a jury will agree with you, you plead not guilty and go to trial. If you hope to work out some sort of plea agreement, you plead not guilty and you go to trial. If you are totally guilty and you hope to weasel out of it, you plead not guilty and you go to trial. Pleading guilty, you're up against established sentencing guidelines and whatever mood the judge is in; pleading not guilty, you're (probably) up against a jury of your peers. All of that said, if you plead not guilty and it turns out to be a complete waste of the court's time because everything but your plea shows that you really *are* guilty, the judge can and sometimes will punish you for that. But (in our system) on its own pleading 'not guilty' is not perjuring yourself, because you are not legally required to help them prosecute you."}]}
{"id": "8ohjly", "input": "If humans can only hear sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz, how does it matter if headphones and speakers have frquency ranges that are greater than 20-20,000?", "output": [{"answer": "The short answer is that it doesn't matter. No, you cannot perceive frequencies higher than 20 kHz, either by hearing or by vibrotactile perception (feeling it). Depending on your age, you might not be able to hear above 15-16 kHz. There are several reasons we can't hear above these frequencies. The primary one is because the physical organ of hearing doesn't resonate at these frequencies. The organ of hearing lies along a membrane which is narrow and stiff at one end, where it resonates more with high frequencies, and floppy and wide at the other end, where it resonates more with low frequencies. It's much like piano strings. It's a pretty basic physical system in that sense. Above around 20 kHz, you're not going to get a lot of sympathetic vibration along the membrane. Secondly, cells (and attached nerves) are arranged along this membrane which are activated basic on frequency, with cells and nerves at the short, stiff end coded for high frequencies, and cells at the other end coded for low frequencies. This \"tonotopic\" organization is preserved all the way to the auditory cortex. As we age, we lose cells and nerves coded for high frequencies first, which is why by out teen years we start to be unable to hear up to 20 kHz. There is really no vibrotacile perception of high frequencies. It may be possible, but the level would have to be extreme, way above any potential output of an earphone. The other thing to consider is that most sound files aren't going to have information in frequencies above around 20 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs is 44.1 kHz, making the Nyquist frequency (above which no information is coded), 22.05 kHz. This gets into signal processing stuff, but essentially the way the digital information is preserved is such that you aren't sampling fast enough to accurately encode frequencies above about 22 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs for example was chosen at 44.1 kHz because humans cannot hear above 20 kHz, so it didn't need to be any higher. There will also be a low-pass filter used which will further restrict frequency information above the Nyquist frequency in order to avoid something called aliasing. The short of that is: even if we could hear above 20 kHz, and even if headphones can reliably produce these frequencies, even if drivers can pump fast enough to create these, there aren't frequencies that high present in most common audio formats. Very low frequencies you can feel, sure - but most music doesn't contain frequencies below 20 Hz (most won't go below probably 50 Hz), so again, unlikely to matter if the headphones can go super low. As with many audiophile things, the extended frequency range of most fancy headphones is just kind of a dick swinging contest."}]}

How can light and heat come from something we can't really touch?", "output": [{"answer": "What you see in fire is the excited gases escaping from a chemical reaction at the source of the fire and expelling energy in the form of light and heat. (so yes it is a thing) The combustion reaction varies by material is usually O2 (Oxygen from the air) and the material (usually containing Hydrocarbons ie lots of Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen). The result is CO2 (carbon dioxide) + H2O vapor+CO (carbon MONoxide) and leftover material that is superheated ash and junk. The reaction itself being the breakdown of a complex or high energy state with a lot of bonds/bonding energy to a lower energy state (simpler molecules with fewer bonds), is ejecting A LOT of energy causing nearby material to also heat up and breakdown. This is why fire spreads - it's a chain reaction of exothermic reactions. The bright part of the fire is the superheated gases that are expelling energy in the form of light and heat (the color is dependent on the material being burnt - lots of physics/chemistry here). The gas generation means it's initially pushed out in all directions. Being super hot is also super light so it's gets pushed up by the denser colder air around it. As it cools and settles into it's final form (there are a lot of intermediate states) it no longer gives of light, just soot and ash."}]}

Soap is great on the skin, but deeper inside a wound it is a chemical that clearly doesn't belong, so the nerves start complaining. The 'bio' part of antibiotic means living things, as in 'biology'. Since we are also living things, the introduction of an antibiotic substance is as foreign, to the nerves inside us, as other harmful things like bacteria would be if left unchecked.

If you want to see the scientific community go into a fight where someone is going to get hurt get an entomologist together with a botanist to discuss the evolution of flowering plants and insects that pollinate them. What we can surmise so far. Plant life most likely some type of algae and or fungi come to the edge of the water line and then onto land. Eventually more complicated life forms followed which eventually includes ancestors of insects (this is such a gross oversimplification it is bad) . Remember plants though have a head start but these are not plants that necessarily flower or produce pollen. We will need millions of years to go by before that happens. However starting to play catch up are insects. Lots of them. Of all sorts of different types. Giving them a few million years and you will eventually end up with wasps which are the ancestor to bees (again a horrible oversimplification). Plants can self pollinate in the forms of pines and ginkos and a few others. Now is where things get fun. Did the plants produce fruits that would have been consumed by herbivores in order to help disperse seeds? But that is not pollination per se. You are right but remember seed production is the result of pollination. So wind pollination becomes possible for flowers but the fossil timeline does not give a definitive answer because there is an overlap with flowering plants with sticky pollen that was carried by insects and other animals. What we do know is that we have some really old plant fossils with sticky pollen and some really old plant fossils with non sticky pollen. We also have insects and animals that are evolving at the same time to work these plants and developing in such a way that this becomes beneficial to the animals and the plants at the same time. There are plants that wind pollinate without insects or other animals helping them. There are plants that must have animals or insects to help pollinate them or they don't make it. There are plants that self pollinate and don't care about either of the above groups. The aspect of co-evolution is taken very seriously here because it offers the best insight into the current data. With new discoveries things may change but it is an interesting matter of research and some of the coolest things about have been happening in the last five years. I have had to correct my talks with new information a lot because of new and wonderful information that has been showing up in the journals."}]}

Why isn't this the case for tv channels?", "output": [{"answer": "None of these answers are correct. A song copyright has several different parts: the right to display publicly, the right to reproduce, the right to distribute, the right to perform, and the right to make derivative works. Most musicians handle the performance aspect of their work by enlisting a Performance Rights Organization (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC). These organization handle the payment of PERFORMANCE ROYALTIES, which come from the licenses that businesses and radio stations need to play music. Restaurant of a certain size playing music? You need to a blanket license. Radio station? You need a license. Concert venue? You need a license. A blanket license allows a venue or business to play all of the songs in BMI or ASCAP's catalogs \u2013the rate dependent on venue size, audience, etc. Now what makes this interesting is that terrestrial radio is unique from the internet in that terrestrial radio pays no performance royalties for the MASTER RECORDING of songs on the radio. When you listen to a song, the song is two copyrights: the COMPOSITION COPYRIGHT (the actual composition of the song, the melody, the lyrics) and the MASTER COPYRIGHT (the copyright for the actual recording itself. Often owned by the label). Imagine that Kesha has a song on the radio with millions of plays, but she didn't write it. She will receive NO performance royalties for her song on the radio. Instead, the songwriters will receive all the terrestrial performance royalties on the radio. This is due to master recordings not actually having a copyright until around 1972. The digital space changed this loophole because digital radio is not really \"radio\" in the legal definition of the word. However, for non interactive radio streams (e.g. a online broadcast of the terrestrial broadcast), these streams can still stream songs with a performance license \u2013they just need to pay performance license fees for the master recordings as well. Television is not nearly as cut and dry as music is administering broadcasting rights. First of all, TV shows have tons of different copyrights going on. They have music. They have logos. They have a whole bunch of stuff. These differences make licensing television deals way different. Ignore typos it's late. tl;dr performance rights for music are outsourced to performance rights organizations which facilitate playing music online/on the radio.

If you don't have a receiver or you are playing the sound through the tv speakers, there is little to be done. You could try changing dynamic range on the player or see if there is a dialogue boost setting on the tv or dvd player. If you have a receiver or some form of a sound system, you can, as others have said, boost the center channel. I have my system setup where it accepts 5.1/7.1 and plays it through 4 speakers (2 front and 2 rear). It is a phantom center channel, so the center channel gets played through my big front speakers. I've noticed the front speakers have a much bigger frequency range than the center, so having the center channel speaker lost some of the experience (for example the rain sequence at the beginning of gladiator - having a center speaker causes some of the clear rain sounds to disappear or not play at all). So this has improved dialogue a little. In my experience, having very loud music/background noise/ everything else and quiet dialogue is a sign of a poorly encoded audio mix. I forget where I read it, but I think issues with dialogue volume are instances where the audio tracks weren't adjusted properly from levels set while playing at the movie theaters vs the levels encoded into the blu ray. I've changed every setting imaginable, and run with my center channel boosted 10db and it still doesn't fix the issue on certain movies. It is extremely annoying having to turn down the volume when people are not speaking because the volume is what to high."}]}

Was this due to his political moves? His military tactics? There's no clear consensus on this; for obvious reasons it's pretty much impossible to have an objective conversation about the guy, so there's a lot of hyperbole on both sides. As for why he might be considered a genius, the Nazis were amazingly successful, all things considered. Recall that Germany went from being completely broken and disarmed to owning nearly all of Europe in just a few years. In addition, he had a few very early victories which completely shattered the Allies in Europe. Whether this was actual genius though, or just beginners luck is impossible to say. As time went on, his mental capacity certainly began to falter though, and by the end of the war he was a barely functional drug addict.  >  Furthermore, if he was a genius (or even a great leader) what was his downfall? Was there a crucial pivotal event where his supposed intelligence was wrong? The answer pretty much everyone is going to give you is Operation Barbarossa. Without question, the Soviet Union was the most important opposition to Hitler. The Nazis suffered about 80% of their losses on the Eastern Front. Whether the decision to invade or not was actually a mistake though is debated by historians. While the two parties may have worked together early in the war, they were anything but friends. Sooner or later, the Nazis and the Communists *would* come to blows. By launching a sneak attack, Hitler at least took the initiative and had the opportunity to set the stage in his favor. Indeed, the initial push was massively successful; the Nazis were viewed as *liberators* by a shockingly large number of people (remember, Stalin was not exactly popular). If the Nazis had decided to arm the Slavs and turn them against the Soviets instead of trying to exterminate them, they might have actually won. Of course, that was impossible for Nazi ideology, so maybe it could have had unforeseen consequences. Such is the way of things with alternative history. Aside from Barbarossa, there were a couple other large mistakes which would come back to haunt him. Not smashing the British at Dunkirk eventually would eventually bite him in the ass. Not trying to find a way to keep the Americans out of the European Theater was likewise a failure. The short of the matter though is simply that Hitler was just some dude with a lot of ambition, in the right place at the right time. He wasn't the larger than life figure pop culture has made him out to be. As for the war, war is chaos. Even the best people make mistakes, and no one ever knows for sure what the consequences of their actions will be. There are multiple junctions in which the tide of the conflict could theoretically turned, but there's no way to say for certain."}]}
{"id": "4ymixf", "input": "I just watched the Big Short, and I still don't understand what \"shorting\" is. How does buying credit swaps profit you when the market collapses? Who pays that out and why?", "output": [{"answer": "You're kind of asking two questions actually, so: **Short selling** The usual way to make money in finance is to \"buy low, sell high.\" This is called going long. You buy a thing (a stock, say) for $100, it goes up to $120, sell it there - you made $20. Hooray! Short selling reverses that to \"sell high, buy low\". But you don't have it, so...you borrow it from someone else, with the promise to give it back later. You borrow it, sell it at $100, and if it goes down, you buy it back at $80 and give it back. You made $20. Hooray! The person, however, that lent the stock to you is sad since what was formerly worth $100 is now $80. There are other costs associated with short selling but this is the core idea. **Credit Default Swaps** So credit default swaps (I assume you mean these by \"credit swaps\") are a thing. They are commonly referred to by the acronym CDS. This is different from short selling. You loan me $100. But I'm a deadbeat and you're worried I won't pay you back. You will be sad if I don't pay you back because you lose that $100 and the interest I pay you on the loan. This keeps you up at night. Your friend Alice, however, thinks I'm not a deadbeat. So she makes a deal with you, kind of like insurance: you pay her a few bucks every three months, and if I turn out to be a deadbeat and can't pay up, she'll pay you $100. If I'm not a deadbeat, I pay you back the $100, and Alice just pockets the cash you've paid her. It's like if you pay insurance on your house and it never burns down. (There are significant technical complications I'm not getting into, but it's the core idea) The difference between insurance and CDS is that I can't insure someone else's house. So if I owe Bob $100 instead of you, you can still make that bet with Alice (the CDS). You pay a few bucks every three months to Alice insuring my debt to Bob. If I turn out to be a deadbeat, Alice pays you $100 - even though I have nothing to do with you. **Shorting and CDS** \"Shorting\" is just when you make money when a thing loses value. A \"long\" is when you bet that the thing is going to be worth more later. A short position is a bet that something fails. I know that sounds mean, but it's a valuable tool: it makes prices in financial markets work properly. Things should be worth what they're correctly worth. If they're worth too much, someone should drive the price down. Shorting helps that. Short selling is clearly a bet that a thing loses value. If you pay for CDS on my debt, you make money if I go bankrupt and my debt lost value. So you're shorting me. That's how these concepts relate. (This is informal, it's ELI5 after all - more formally \"the protection buyer in a CDS is shorting the credit quality of the reference obligation\" but meh)"}]}

So the racers are followed by cars bringing water to them. But to get to the cars the cyclists have to drop out of the pack and then race them again with all the extra water. So most of the members of a team is not supposed to win anything. They are just paid to bring water to the pack, control the speed of the pack when needed and to help fighting for position within the pack. If you have watched a sprint you may notice that there is a lot of people starting early and then giving up far from the line. These are not supposed to win but supposed to help their team mates get a better start to the sprint. As for the team tactics there is a lot of things going on. Tour de France have a lot of different objectives that teams can go for so the team manager have a lot of different options during the race. Every team also have a captain to help make decisions. There is also a lot of unwritten rules among the riders that help create a friendly environment for them all. So you very often see riders help each other during the race even if they do not directly benefit from this. Bad manners will make the three weeks very hard for you and may even prevent the team from getting invited for next year."}]}
{"id": "5jel72", "input": "I've always heard that multivitamins aren't very beneficial because your body can't absorb all the vitamins at once and the excess is excreted. Could your body absorb more of the vitamins if you cut the multivitamin into pieces and ate it throughout the day, instead of all at once?", "output": [{"answer": "Physician here, multivitamins have never been shown to be beneficial and have actually been shown to increase mortality in people taking them. There's honestly no very hard evidence that you can look at to be 100% sure in explaining WHY this is, but based on what we know about the individual components in a multivitamin we can take an educated guess. First off, chances are simply that you are NOT deficient in most vitamins. Our food is specially fortified in the developed world, that's why milk has Vitamin A+D added to it, and a ridiculous number of products have Vitamin C spiked into it. Add in the other foods you eat and most of us get most of the vitamins we need with the exception of Vitamin D, because normally a lot of this is generated via sun exposure (though there is some literature that argues that you can still be deficient despite lots of sunlight mostly in dermatology literature arguing against telling people to get more sunlight due to fears of skin cancer) and many of us don't get intense enough sunlight in the northern hemisphere due to the weather as well as the fact that we wear clothing and aren't running around naked with all our skin exposed to the sun. Not being deficient in most vitamins, taking additional vitamins really doesn't actually do you any good. Now as for why there is possible HARM from vitamins, well a lot of vitamins are used by your cells to grow. And the normal amount of vitamins we eat are plenty for our cells to grow and heal normally. The one exception is that cancer cells like to keep growing and growing, so they're the only cells that are really limited by the normal dietary supply of many of the vitamins (in particular, B vitamins and folic acid). So now if you have a few cancerous cells in your body and you start taking tons of extra vitamins, the only cells that actually need more than the vitamins you get in a regular diet are the cancer cells, so you're basically stimulating the growth of cancers. On top of this, there is some evidence that many of the components that are popular in regular multivitamins aren't that great for you. For example, there are studies showing that folic acid in the specific form found in vitamins seems to increase cancer risk while folic acid found in vegetables actually decreases the risk of cancers-in particular breast cancer in women who drink alcohol. The EXCEPTION to this is that if you are pregnant, taking the pill version DOES reduce neural tube defects in your child so if you're pregnant or expecting to become pregnant shortly it is beneficial to take a folic acid supplement via a prenatal vitamin, it's just not beneficial to continue supplementing folic acid after you're no longer pregnant. But eating a diet heavy in fresh folic acid (via leafy greens such as spinach) is beneficial either way. Then on top of the fact that some of the components may not be beneficial or may not come in the version of the vitamin that occurs naturally, you have the fact that VITAMINS CAN INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN IN A TEST TUBE WHEN PUT INTO YOUR BODY. There are tons of enzymes as well as breakdown products of food in your digestive tract and in your bloodstream that interact with the vitamins to change their state and sometimes vitamins that may not have bad interactions with each other in a test tube may be changed by enzymes, or random lipids in your diet, or stomach acid, etc. into something that will interact with another vitamin to form chemicals that may not be beneficial to you. And when you take a multivitamin you're basically taking dozens of vitamins all at once, and there's very little data about what interacts with what, you basically have to go look up research on every single pairing, and specifically research about it in the environments of the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine. Basically we have no idea what the exact interactions are between all these vitamins in an in vivo setting when you add all the extra variable of the specific foods you're eating. TL;DR: There's no good evidence that you should take a multivitamin unless there is a specific illness your physician has asked you to take one for. Other specific supplements may be beneficial if you are deficient (i.e. Vitamin D) and some supplements may be beneficial in only specific situations (i.e. take folic acid in prenatal vitamins if you're getting pregnant or are pregnant) but may not be helpful at other times. There's tons of vitamins in the food you eat too, so there's only a few things that really need supplementing. Eat your vegetables instead of a multivitamin, because eating 7+ servings of vegetables has one of the tightest associations with better long term health."}]}

If the water is moving slowly then it will not overcome the force holding it to the glass (adhesion). However if it moves quickly, the water has more momentum and it can break free and pour away from the glass. If the water cannot \"break free\" of the surface then it will simply roll over the lip of the glass and trickle down the outside.

First, a corporation as an entity needs to be able to have some legal framework to operate under, there are different kinds of corporations with different charters and laws that they must follow, but the key is that they have to have some framework work under. There are also other legal frameworks collections of people can operate under (labour unions, associations, political parties etc.). Now what does this mean about things like corporations and speech? Well corporations are a collection of people, and if you impose a limitation on the speech of a collection of people you are limiting the speech of those people, which is a violation of (in the US) the first amendment. For example, book publishers are corporations, and if you can prohibit one type of speech you could perhaps do this to another. In the US the supreme court has rules the risk of corruption does not meet a standard of 'strict scrutiny', which would have allowed rules limiting political speech."}]}
{"id": "257980", "input": "Before aviation, how was it possible to make such detailed maps of the world?", "output": [{"answer": "The improvement in the quality of world maps had nothing to do with aviation. Rather, it came from much earlier improvements in timekeeping: the [pendulum clock]( URL_4 ) (1657) and the [marine chronometer]( URL_3 ) (c. 1760) were the key inventions, along with discoveries in astronomy. Why? If you look at really old maps very closely and compare them to modern ones, you may notice that in the old maps the latitudes are normally accurate, but the longitudes are way off. That's because without accurate clocks, it's basically impossible to measure your longitude. The first accurate measurements of longitude were done by sending a pendulum clock, a specialized telescope (a [transit instrument]( URL_1 )) and an astronomer along with marine expeditions. When they reach land at a point where they'll be staying for a few weeks, this happens: 1. The astronomer sets up the transit instrument (which must be aligned precisely north/south) 2. The astronomer has a bunch of tables saying at what times those stars reach their highest point in the sky when seen from Greenwich, England (or some other location). Over the course of a few nights, he uses these and the transit instrument (telescope) to set the clock to Greenwich time, and adjusts the speed of the clock so that it shows the correct Greenwich time for every star he observes. 3. After the clock has been set up and adjusted, he can observe the Greenwich time that the sun in this location reaches its highest spot in the sky. After applying some correction tables, this tells him the longitude of his location: 4 minutes of time difference = 1 degree of longitude. This process was incredibly expensive: it required sending a highly trained astronomer and very expensive, delicate equipment, and it took days to complete. So it wasn't done very often. Marine chronometers were a later invention that basically allowed ordinary marine navigators to determine their longitude at sea very quickly, using a much more affordable clock. [Captain James Cook]( URL_2 ) was one of the first people to use a marine chronometer for making maps (in his [second voyage]( URL_0 ), 1772-75), and his maps were very accurate:  >  Another accomplishment of the second voyage was the successful employment of the Larcum Kendall K1 chronometer, which enabled Cook to calculate his longitudinal position with much greater accuracy. Cook's log was full of praise for the watch which he used to make charts of the southern Pacific Ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20th century."}]}
{"id": "3kfsn9", "input": "\"Clutch\" in Car. Why we have to press clutch to change gears? Why can't we directly change gears?", "output": [{"answer": "This is how the clutch operates: When your engine is running, its job is to turn the up-and-down motion of the pistons into a circular motion. There are a whole series of linkages and feedback mechanisms, but ultimately the important part is that there is a *crankshaft* -- you can think of this as a long metal rod that rotates lengthwise. Now this turning motion of the crankshaft needs to be applied to the gearbox, so that the right amount of power gets ultimately sent to another long metal rod -- this one's called the driveshaft -- and ultimately to the wheels. So far, so straightforward. As always, the devil is in the detail. When the engine is running the crankshaft is rotating thousands of times per minute. This means that the gears are also rotating thousands of times per minute. If you were to try to shift gears (i.e. move from one rotating cog to another) at this speed, it would be almost impossible to do without grinding the gears against one another. So what's needed is a mechanism to slow down the gearbox rotation, which can be achieved if we temporarily disconnect the gearbox from the crankshaft which is giving it power. This mechanism is called the clutch. There are many ways in which a clutch can be designed, but the most common is very straightforward. At the end of the crankshaft is a large flat disk (picture it as a plate attached at the end of a broom handle). This disk obviously rotates with the crankshaft. Crucially, the disk is covered in a very rough material, which means it creates friction with whatever it touches. In the gearbox is another similar disk, also covered in a rough material. Now, when the clutch is disengaged (i.e. when you're not pushing the pedal down), the two disks are pushed against each other by a powerful spring. Because of their high-friction coatings this means that when the disk at the end of the crankshaft rotates, it also causes the gearbox disk to rotate, which transmits power to the gears, and your car moves forward. Now you push the clutch pedal down. The spring is forced away from the disks (this is why you need quite a strong left foot to push the clutch!) and the two rotating plates move apart from each other. We've now successfully disconnected the rotation of the crankshaft from the gearbox; the gear rotation slows down and you're able to smoothly shift into a different gear. As you gradually bring your foot up the clutch plates start to touch each other, and if you do this smoothly and gently then they begin to rotate in sync again. Bring your foot up too quickly however, and the speeds of the two disks are mismatched and the car could lurch forwards or even stall. (There are a number of additional complexities and refinements that I've left out, but this is the basic principle of how a clutch works and why you need it)."}]}

That means that etnies that hated each other like the Tutsis and the Hutus had to share the same country. Being unable to cooperate in even the smallest details, war was guaranteed for countries like these. Civil war means no progress, no progress means no cars. Another example is the Cold War. During this period several dictators and coup d'\u00e9tat winners made deals with the USSR or the USA for money, protection, legitimization of their governments, etc. In exchange for money, weapons to defeat internal opposition or simply in exchange for a blind eye in case of gross violations of human rights, these states would became supportive of one these two super-powers who were trying to rule the world. Right now, the problems are still the same. Countries like Sudan are still living this nightmare, South Sudan (rich in petrol and minerals) broke up from Sudan so they could live in peace. Right now they're living a new civil war because their elites don't want to share power, wealth and control with each other. Plus, we are living a new Scramble for Africa. China is attacking with all it's might and sending huge waves of migrants to African territories, providing cheaply made infrastructures like Hospitals, Roads and Schools in exchange for resources, political influence and international prestige. So yeah, Africa as a whole is still trying to get up on it's feet, time will tell if they can or can't."}]}

Collateral damage caused by suspicious GIs, South Vietnamese troops, and air campaigns helped enlist many against the South Vietnamese. The United States let the media have free reign in what was a gruesome conflict, who then relayed many of these images back to the United States, in the age of television. Night after night, Americans would have the atrocities of war displayed in their living rooms. The Tet Offensive was a traumatizing affair - the United States Embassy under the attack from the Viet Cong was a traumatizing event for many who thought that the United States, as a world power, was untouchable. The escalation of the war (1965, half a million marines were sent) made it one of the biggest deployments since Korea.

{"id": "4gjagn", "input": "How a nuclear reactor works to produce energy.", "output": [{"answer": "Nuclear reactors use fissionable materials (Usually Uranium or Plutonium) that emit \u201cfast\u201d neutrons naturally through radioactive decay. These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered \u201cthermalized\u201d and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated. tl;dr: Hot core creates steam which pushes a turbine around which generates power. The heat level of the core is controlled by chemicals and/or rods. EDIT: spelling, grammar"}]}

{"id": "8kb219", "input": "In the United States, why is soccer such a popular sport for little kids, but not as popular among older kids (high school, college)", "output": [{"answer": "So, this is starting to change slowly, but at its most basic level, it is because soccer is not as established in North America. Because North America is very isolated from the rest of the world, it developed differently. When football was being established on this continent, it was the Rugby Union game that dominated. Though the game has changed over the past century and a half, the basic structure of the game - scoring points by carrying an egg-shaped ball over a goal line and/or kicking it through a pair of uprights, defense being achieved via bringing the ball carrier to the ground - is shared. But by the time it was able to spread out of the US and Canada, other games had already established dominance (similarly, Australian football, while very popular in Australia, is virtually unknown in the Northern Hemisphere). The same is true in the other direction. By the time that large numbers of soccer playing immigrants crossed the Atlantic, we already had our own football, and soccer wasn't going to displace it. The immigrant communities did play soccer, but it was as much a cultural thing as it was athletic. When I was in high school, I found a copy of the 1959 yearbook, which was the year that the school first fielded a soccer team. It was noted in the blurb about the team that nearly all of the players had started the season having never played the game before. This scenario has an effect on future generations. A parent who doesn't know anything about soccer is less likely to put their child in soccer, and even if they do, they will have to learn if they want to be able to follow their kid's game or talk to them about the sport. As my generation, who grew up playing soccer, are now at the age where we are having children of our own, we are far more likely to choose soccer as an activity for them. As for the age drop off, in the US, it is a big thing to keep kids in lots of activities. There's swimming lessons, karate, dance, music, and sports to fill your kid's time with. Sports tend to have defined seasons, and they don't necessarily overlap, so you can put your children in tee-ball in the spring, soccer in the fall, basketball in the winter. That way, they are always busy. Soccer is especially popular for younger children because it is easy to scale the field down based on age, and it is relatively low on contact, so children are less likely to get hurt. Up to a certain point, it is even reasonable to have co-ed programs. Once kids get older, the player base starts to diverge. It's especially noticeable with boys, as the biggest competitor for players is football, which is by and large the province of males. Let's say that most boys who are involved in organized sports play soccer from age 5-9. Once they turn 10, they are old enough for football, so a bunch of those kids will go off to the gridiron. As they get older, kids will start to specialize too. Maybe they play soccer, swim competitively, and take piano lessons. That eats up a huge amount of time, so at some point, a choice has to be made. The money aspect is a big deal too. Colleges can and do offer full scholarships for soccer, but there isn't the kind of money in MLS that there is in the NFL or NBA. A good soccer player could try to go to Europe to play professionally, but they end up competing with players who have been playing in an organized club environment that is based around developing future professionals (rather than being just an extracurricular activity) from a very young age and likely started their professional career before age 20, compared to a 21 or 22 year old who is graduating from college, where they practiced and played during the season, but were restricted as to what they could do in the off-season, and also had to balance a full-time course load."}]}

Also they symptoms themselves in the early stages look appear to be the Flu or a bad cold, which includes.. Fever Vomiting Headache Muscle aches Sore throat General weakness Diarrhea Then as the virus progresses that's when the dangerous symptoms start including... Bleeding inside and outside of the body Rash Trouble breathing This can also lead to a very low white blood cell count which makes it harder for the body to fight off the virus. By this time it's likely too late for the patient to recover. Lastly it is HIGHLY INFECTIOUS. As stated it is easy to spread the virus through human contact. And as you can see from the symptoms (i.e. Vomiting, Diarrhea, Fever (causes sweating), and Bleeding in later stages) it would be easy to transmit the virus while treating a patient without proper protection and extreme caution. Also it is possible to get the virus from a dead body that had the virus so as people die and embalming/burials are carried out transmission of the virus can still be taking place. But there is good news for those who are afraid and living in first world! The main sources for the Ebola Virus is fruit bats, chimps, and other animals really only found and consumed in Africa. Also the 90% mortality rate is based on mostly outbreaks in Africa. Africa has a high rate of HIV as well and as you may know HIV severely inhibits immune function which is really the only way to fight the virus and any other infections that may come into play. And finally as we know Africa's medical establishments are not nearly as advanced as the rest of the developed world which also plays a part in the mortality rate. UPDATE/EDIT: as /u/nerdbebo has pointed out, infection does not normally take place until the patient is showing symptoms according to the CDC which would make the infectious period shorter but keep in mind that the first symptoms that show up mimic minor disease or the flu so people would still be going about like normal until they would figure out that something more serious is going on.

{"id": "28n0vu", "input": "Why are Conspiracies typically dismissed without investigation?", "output": [{"answer": "Usually, conspiracy theories **are** investigated, in some way. Quite thoroughly, in any instance where there could be truth to the allegations. But then the people who believe in them won't take \"that insane thing you said didn't happen\" for an answer. Instead, they decide that whoever did the investigating is part of the conspiracy. Obviously, some things do not require investigation. Like the conspiracy theory which states that the Queen of England is a reptilian space alien. We can dismiss that one out of hand. EDIT: A perfect example of a conspiracy theory that's been totally investigated to death: the idea that the moon landing was faked. Ludicrous amounts of evidence has been amassed, proving that it wasn't faked. The footage has been examined to a ridiculous level of detail. The fact of the matter is, it was not possible to fake the landing, using 1969 technology. But people refuse to accept that, and go on believing what they want...in part because it makes them feel good to be \"in the know,\" or \"not a sheep like everyone else.\" That's the main psychology, in my opinion. Conspiracy theorists are usually massive egotists. They can't stand the idea that they might not be smarter than everyone else, and they **certainly** cannot entertain the possibility that they might be incorrect."}]}
{"id": "3huyqv", "input": "How do you get caught counting cards?", "output": [{"answer": "Counting cards does not automatically make you money. It tells you *when* the cards are favorable to you, and you should increase your bets. Casinos have people observing players at all times, and if they spot a player who modifies his bet by 10x (betting $10 a hand, then suddenly $100 a hand), then they will watch them, checking to see whether their higher bets match favorable card counts. If they have suspicion that somebody is making a consistent profit, they will first take mild counter-measures. For example, they will shuffle the deck more often (so 'good counts' don't happen as much). But if a player is a consistent winner, especially over a number of visits, then the casino will ask the player to leave. Do they have evidence? Sure! They have a half-dozen different video cameras, facial recognition, observation reports from dealers and 'pit bosses' (dealer supervisors). They are tracking players better than they can track themselves. They won't kick you out on a hunch. There are different levels of card counting. The higher levels are difficult, but I understand they can result in profitable play with less modification of bets. This means that a player is less likely to be detected. Another way to 'hide' your counting is to use team play. /u/r3solv mentions this below. One person is just a 'grinder', playing little bets, but counting. When the count becomes favorable, then the 'whale' sits down, lays down some big bets for however long it's favorable, then leaves. In that manner, the 'grinder' doesn't turn a profit, but *the team* does. Google \"MIT Blackjack team\" for more gory details."}]}
{"id": "23xtul", "input": "How to explain depression to my spouse who believes it's not a real disease and can be controlled by deciding to not be sad.", "output": [{"answer": "Well, let me try to help. I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input. The main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word \"depression\" is widely missused to identify \"sadness\". People say \"I'm depressed\" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship. Depression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is \"numbness\". You know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm/leg \"falls asleep\"? That's depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don't feel any propper emotion. That's why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They \"fall asleep\". Depressed people are usually seen as \"sad\" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple \"yeah, I know, that sucks\", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It's just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say \"ouch\". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke. That is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson (\"red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario's hat!\"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know. So when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of \"something fun\", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are \"asleep\". And when you tell him \"this is not sadness, it is depression!\", what he hears is \"this is not sadness, it is sadness!\", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don't, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can't experience what you are experiencing. Try and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he'll get it eventually. Finally, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. Think of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you. TL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation. (BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes)"}]}
{"id": "1vzi61", "input": "Do ex-prisoners who have been found not-guilty a while into their wrongful sentencing receive any compensation for their unnecessary time in prison?", "output": [{"answer": "It depends on a lot of factors. For instance, some states will only pay *exonerated* prisoners. Note that being \"exonerated\" is different from being found \"not guilty\" on appeal or at a new trial. \"Exonerated\" is defined by some states as being absolutely ruled out as a guilty person-- for instance, by DNA evidence. It is not enough to be found \"not guilty\" on appeal because of, for instance, bad jury instructions. Other states only offer compensation for people who are convicted because of misconduct by prosecutors or police-- not just a bad jury decision that is later set aside. That can make getting compensation very hard in cases of coerced confessions (which *do* happen). In many states, there are legal guidelines for payouts to the wrongfully imprisoned, but the money isn't paid automatically. People who are wrongfully sent to prison often have to sue to get this money-- and the cost involved in suing can make it hard. The Innocence Project has a [good guide to which states in the United States have laws to pay the wrongfully imprisoned]( URL_0 ). For instance, Nevada doesn't have any laws to pay people wrongfully sent to prison. Texas, on the other hand, provides $80k per year in prison, plus $25k per year spent on the sex offender registry, college tuition, and back child support payments-- but only if the wrongfully imprisoned person has been pardoned or \"granted relief on the basis of actual innocence\". The short answer is: it varies significantly from place to place. And this is a fairly US-centric answer: I have no idea what the laws are outside the United States."}]}

{"id": "2wde60", "input": "Why the USA needs, or doesn't need, to have its military at the size that it is.", "output": [{"answer": "There are three states that the world can be in: *One superpower* *Multiple superpowers* *No super powers (every country equally as strong as another)* Lets start with the last one. By nature, countries will compete for dominance over one another for political, economic, and security reasons. Therefore this state is almost unattainable. Not all countries can afford or care to keep up with the others, so there will never be a time when no country is more powerful than others. Now for the middle state, *multiple superpowers*. This is what the cold war was. This ends up the same as we discussed above, because the countries that CAN afford to compete for power DO compete, and end up in 'cold' wars with one another. This can happen with any number of countries, for instance during the last half of the 20th century it was two (US and USSR), but it could easily happen with three, four, or more countries competing for dominance. First on this list is close to what we have now, *one superpower*. The united states 'won' the cold war because the other guy quit competing. That left it with no other country even CLOSE to being as powerful militarily or spending as much as they did. Here they had two options: stop spending because our main threat is 'gone', or keep spending to PREVENT them from being able to come back. The US chose the latter, obviously. Many people think that a system of one superpower is the most realistic 'best' option. It is unrealistic to think that countries will not compete with each other, and a cold war is dangerous for the entire planet because nuclear arms exist. The theory is this: If the US spends so much money and has such a large military presence in most of the world that they can counter any emerging threats before they get too big, that *theoretically* means that other countries would have a hard time becoming powerful enough to inflict major harm on other countries because the US *could* swoop in at any time and stop them. While the US is not a perfect country, most of the world (the west and some of Asia) thinks that the US is a good choice because *the other candidates are worse*. Russia? Most of the world doesn't want them to have the power. China? Same thing. Both have terrible human rights records and less obligation to do things fairly because they don't answer to their citizens in the same way. While the US doesn't do things fairly or always do the 'right' thing, it's pretty much the only candidate for the job that has a *chance* of doing the right thing. Ancillary reasons: With the US military being so large and powerful, many Europeans countries can spend WAY less money per capita on their military. This is good for them. Part of the reason the US spends more than the next 13 countries combined is because they hardly spend anything at all since they either can't keep up enough to matter against the US military or they are friends with the US. The US spends a lot but we have for all of recent memory so the citizens don't put up much fuss. It also helps that having the most powerful military in the world allows you to exert your will on other countries for political, economic, or security reasons."}]}
{"id": "609xpd", "input": "Can the capacity of our brains be roughly measured in bytes?", "output": [{"answer": "Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I'm not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial. I do know that to say the brain's storage reduces to the number of neuron connections is probably not correct. It's far more complex than that. There is also a dynamic electro-chemical state between and within the synapses which has some information storage capacity--various ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, for instance. Things like \"are you happy\" probably aren't stored in a chart showing which neuron is connected to which other. You can take a pill to change that variable. Then, unlike a regular computer, the brain and the body has evolved an extremely integrated interface with its environment such that it's often difficult to tell where you draw the line between brain and not-brain. For instance, what about your body temperature? It effects cognition, and is in a feedback path with the brain. Could that be considered a form of storage? There are many examples like that. It's often forgotten that information is specific to context. A forgotten language can only be deciphered if we actually share something with the lost civilization-- feelings, biology, environment. The brain is weird because it creates its own context. Since the brain is so closely integrated with its environment, its identity can become blurred and it can become unclear *where* the brain actually is. Your brain organized your room and now your room effects your cognition. Is your room information storage? You have a romantic partner. Your brain interacts with them and changes them. Now they interact with you and change your cognition. Are they storage? The [transactive memory hypothesis] ( URL_0 ) builds on this idea and suggests there are memories that we can only have or have better when we're together with someone we've interacted with before. You could say that these external sources are just external and thus we can ignore them. But your environment, which your brain is changing, effects you whether or not you ask for it. In that way, the external is really not so external. Your environment is not like a USB flash drive. You can't unplug it. There are numerous examples of what happens when you try to unplug it. Extreme isolation for example. The brain just breaks down in these contexts. So environment is actually part of you. If the brain doesn't have well-defined limits, then measuring its capacity is going to be incredibly difficult. It could still be a number in bytes depending on which physics you subscribe to. It's commonly believed that the whole universe has a finite storage capacity. If so, then even a brain without a skull limit still has a universe limit."}]}

It's far more important to keep the pH in the blood as stable as possible, and one of the ways to do that is through inhalation/exhalation of CO2. In a super small chamber without ventilation, there's a risk of suffering from hypercapnia: a condition of elevated CO2 levels in the blood.

The region inside the blue lines is the NYC controlled airspace (technically, we call it \"Class B\"). It's not \"restricted\" in the sense that you're not allowed to fly there. They only serve as a regulatory zone \u2014 that is, you need permission from Air Traffic Control to enter the zone. And in fact, you can fly above or below it without permission all you want. You don't even have to have your radio on or be on a flight plan. There are three major airports in the zone and a fair number of minor ones. It just wouldn't be practical to ban airplanes from that area. And even if you knew there was a rogue airplane coming in to do mischief, there aren't any military bases nearby to get fighters in the air, and if there are any anti-aircraft batteries in the area, I've never heard about it. And finally, as other posters have pointed out, nothing like 9/11 had ever happened before and we were at peace, so there was no reason to think that incoming planes needed to be stopped. Now look at [Washington, DC]( URL_1 ) by contrast. The heavy dashed circle around the area is an Air Defense Identification Zone. You need a clearance to enter this and you have to obtain it in advance. There's a very good chance that you *will* be intercepted by fighters if you come in without permission. It used to be that the only ADIZs were out over the ocean to guard against aircraft coming in from overseas without permission, but since 9/11 we've had one over Washington as well. For good measure, the red circles are Temporary Flight Restrictions, which are thrown up for special occasions such as airshows or VIP visits. However, the big one over Washington isn't so temporary. Even now, this stuff isn't enforced *that* heavily. Some years ago, I saw a guy who flew through the TFR over G.W.Bush's home in Texas while he was in residence. He was intercepted by fighters and ordered to land, and then the police came and took him out of his plane and took him to the station to be questioned. He wasn't shot down, and in fact after he convinced the police that it was an accident, they just let him go. Edit: heh. Looking at the NYC airspace today (15 Sep 2016) I see the whole thing is a TFR (scheduled to start in 3 days). Wasn't there when I made this post. Will probably be gone a week from now."}]}

One day a very thin lady started to show up every Sunday right when we opened. She always came in alone and made a bee line for the bowl of peel and eat shrimp. She would load her plate up with nothing else then go back to her seat and eat all of them. Then she would wait until we refilled it and then she would go back again. She would do this until we were out. The waitstaff wondered how she was able to eat 6+ pounds of shrimp in a few hours. I thought she was putting it into her purse. On her third visit, one of the female staff discreetly monitored her every move. She quickly found out that our guest would make quick trips to the bathroom where she would vomit up everything she ate and then go back and load up on more shrimp. She got the incorrect nickname \"Anna\" short for Anorexic (It should have been Bulimia but we weren't clever enough to come up with an innocent female name we could refer to her as in front of other guests). \"Anna\" would also rarely speak to us. She would smile when appropriate, and either nod or shake her head when asked a question. Once our boss (who never came in on Sundays) found out he did some quick calculations and figured she was losing us too much money. Rather than ban her, he simply had us change our peel and eat strategy. We broke up the peel and eat shrimp from one big bowl into several smaller bowls scattered throughout the buffet line. We were told NOT to refill them until she left. The next Sunday, \"Anna\" showed up and at first frowned at the change in her routine. She had to go through the entire buffet line to get all of the shrimp. She also had to empty each of the bowls as she came across them. Her usual attempts at discretion were no longer working and the guests in line with her started to make comments like \"Wow- are you on a shrimp only diet?\" and \"Hey, leave some for the rest of us!\" \"Anna\" hurried back to her seat, resumed her usual ritual of binging and purging and then sat quietly waiting for us to refill the bowls. I only refilled the one at the end of the buffet so other guests could get some before she got to it. I left the rest of them empty. If any other guest asked for them, I would tell them we were out then quietly take a small bowl out to their table (out of sight of \"Anna\" of course). After about an hour of sitting with a plate of shrimp peelings, \"Anna\" was forced to actually interact with us and ask about the shrimp. When she was told we were out she became visibly upset and stormed out. We never saw her again after that."}]}

We've made a system that we have to use, that no one wants to interact with because it has become so vile and impenetrable. The system is convoluted and fundamentally rotten. Your average american either, A) doesn't have time to wrap their head around everything they feel like they need to know or B) Doesn't want to know because they think it all sucks. 2. The system uses first past the post voting / one person one vote [(watch this video by CGP Grey)]( URL_0 ). This system suppresses multiple party systems, with each person having only 1 vote, it empowers the leaders and discourages smaller groups from attempting to get a say in the system. **Example:** The Owl Party is fiscally conservative and the Hawk party is fiscally liberal, but supports foreign intervention. These are the two dominant parties Zylandia. A break away from the Hawk party wants fiscally liberal but is against foreign intervention. They want to vote for leaders who are like Hawks mostly, what they lack is popular vote because they are new. In First Past the Post / One Person One Vote systems, everyone gets only one vote, and similar candidates will share votes because there is a lot of overlap, so when a race is intra-party (Talon vs Hawk) it is okay. However with Interparty races people who would support the Talon party will feel pressured to vote for the Hawk Party representatives because the Hawk party has more wide spread support and without the support of the Talon party will lose against the Owl party. And Talons dislike Owls more than they dislike Hawks. Because Hawks and Talons are kind of similar, so it's better to get a Hawk in than an Owl. In a multi vote system a Talon supporter could vote for their Talon candidate as their primary vote, and then the Hawk candidate as a second choice. In this way people get to vote for who best exemplifies their beliefs without forcing them to choose between a loser and the dominant party. Forcing all people to vote into one person gives the group of citizens who are most stubborn extraordinary amount of power; ie: religious zealots. 3. Money, the current political system is coin operated, please insert hundreds of thousands of dollars to run for Senate Without fiscal support from wealthy donors or Super PACs many possible candidates cannot have competitive races simply because they cannot raise name awareness, hire employees, and combat attack advertisements.

That agenda is to fix the system so that it can be more representative of the citizenship of the U.S. This allows moderate and more hardline conservative and liberals to vote for their candidates without being controlled by small but powerful groups of people."}]}
{"id": "7cffdn", "input": "How does fridges or freezers work?", "output": [{"answer": "Engineering student currently taking thermodynamics. Fridges and freezers are what\u2019s called thermopumps. Essentially, heat is the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules wizzing and vibrating. As long as a substance is above absolute 0, there is always heat within it. A thermopump sucks in the heat from a region (the inside of your fridge) and dissipates it in another (your kitchen). In nature, heat only moves from hot to cold regions, so how does a thermopump manages to do the opposite? We achieve this by having a refrigerant substance run through a system of tubes, the substance is choosen such that it can be vaporized and liquified easily. There are heat transfers that come with the phase changes (liquid to vapor and vice versa). Last bit of science we need to be aware of to understand the themopump is the fact that not only temperature can induce a phase change, pressure is equally important. In everyday life everything happens at 100kPa so we don\u2019t notice it as much, but water will boil under 100C in high altitude where the pressure is lower. So our refrigerant can be boiled by simply changing the pressure. So now we can get a more applied idea of how the thermopump works. The refrigerant will start as a cold low pressure liquid (colder than the inside of your fridge) that will go through long winding tubes in the inside of your fridge, sucking out the heat to undergo a phase change, turning into vapor. Then enter the compressor, the part of your fridge that requires power, to raise the pressure and temperature of the vapor. It will then go through long winding tubes again, this time on the outside of fridge (your kitchen). The vapor will liquify and thus pouring alot of the heat it gathered earlier inside the fridge, into your kitchen. The high pressure hot liquid will then go through an expansion valve (which will essentially lower the pressure and temperature). Bringing us back to the low pressure cold liquid from the begining. Thus completing the refrigeration cycle. The pressure changes are done to change the phase change point of the refridgerant to the ambiant temperature of both regions. This can be reversed to heat up a home. These systems are more efficient than traditional electrical heaters because they use energy moving heat rather than just generating it. TL;DR: They move the heat inside your fridge/freezer to your kitchen by playing with the refrigerant\u2019s pressure and temperature and phase changes."}]}

Don't airports need security checks?", "output": [{"answer": "the cause of there being a TSA was an attack made apparently easier by the freedom USA provided: almost all world airports at that time had security checkpoints similar to today's (minus the liquid limits), while the US did not. unfortunately, what 9/11 ended up doing was having Americans concede some of their rights and freedoms for a \"feeling\" of security, while giving a ridiculous amount of power to some public and private entities (mostly the federal government) to do whatever they want to protect this \"feeling\" of security. but then, answer this: what made the USA a \"free country\" like no other in the world? what did the union represent, exactly? freedom of speech, right to travel freely, a very efficient government, public tolerance, a bill of rights forcing the government spend most of its budget serving the needs of its people without interfering in their lives, taxation with representation (sorry DC), a legal system that made it extremely hard for the enforcer to breach on US citizens' rights (i'm talking about the Patriot act right here).. these, and many more, made America what it was, and it worked very fucking well. and then 9/11 happened, and most of these went out of the window. like, in less than a year too. Thus I believe the TSA, (- and i'm going to generalize here - most things that happened after 9/11, especially in terms of civil rights and public opinion,) was particularly UN-AMERICAN. It is a costly brute force effort in preventing terrorism in a single mode of transportation, i'll give you that, but a favorable cost-benefit analysis of maybe losing thousands of lives and several multi million dollar planes and the cost of losing people's trust in flying vs. the cost of operating the TSA and the inconvenience it provides regarding lost time could be a very \"american\" and a very reasonable explanation for keeping the TSA, however I still believe shutting down the TSA, (specifically, decreasing but not eliminating federal government's presence in public transportation security,) if ever considered, is a decision that should not have anything to do with its efficiency in preventing terrorist attacks: it should be shut down because America should realize that it stands and will always stand a free country regardless of the cost it has to pay: terrorism is only effective if it instills terror. The US, and the American people should realize and trust that they are strong enough to withstand many, many more blows like that without having to compromise their way of life. but then i'm very utilitarian and there are definitely other questions at bay here: what is a government's primary duty? protecting its' citizens' lives, or their way of life? what is the cost of a human life? would americans have lost trust in their government if it did not show its power to prevent another attack like that, or would they have preferred a government that went business as usual? i can't answer these definitively."}]}

It has to do with a lot of historical events, but mostly with the colonial expansionism that happened between the 16th and the 18th century... For the European nations, territories in America were extensions of their own land for them to explore how they see fit. Most of the American colonies were based on the plantation system that consisted basically on big chunks of land belonging to a few people, on this land they made huge farms where they only cropped one single plant (mostly sugarcane) using mostly slave labor... This made the metropolis rich but didn't developed the American (south + central) society, that's why we have this disparity today. North American colonies (northern USA colonies) were an exception, where land occupation occurred mostly because of religious issues happening in England back then. Regular people coming to the new land were granted a piece of land and the predominant kind of labor was the family one, this developed a prosper internal economy. I tried my best, as I said, SIX HOUR lecture, really tired, on my way home and English is not my first language (not even my third)!

It's a scary thought because it would lay the groundwork for additional government-required medical treatments, regardless of a persons personal beliefs. Especially as the U.S. operates under a 'winner-take-all' political system, the minority could find themselves faced with compulsory medical treatments regardless of personal beliefs. Think of the issues ongoing with pro-life vs pro-choice - depending on how the state/city government decides to swing, one of those two sides is going to have a bad time, which can lead to a lot of extended and deepened animosity. This creates a rather complicated system - you want people to be vaccinated as it is important to help mitigate or eliminate the effects of infectious diseases, but you also want to respect a persons right to personal independence. Compromising one for the sake of the other can create a lot of political tension in either direction that is not easily settled. Now, that's the federal level - at the state level, it can be easier. You have a smaller segment of the population you are dealing with, so creating legislation that deals with these issues is easier. For example, you may not be able to demand that all children be vaccinated, but you *can* pass legislation (with public support) mandating that entry into a public school system from K - 12 requires a certain set of baseline vaccinations. Not everyone is mandated to get them - but if you want into a public school, you have to get those baseline vaccinations. Things like child restraints or smoking age-limits had their own political turmoil during their own time periods for the same reasons - the fight between government-mandates and personal freedom is fairly constant, and depending on your ideology, not easily resolved."}]}

Year one you cut, dry and burn the wood that's closest to the road. Year two, you have to go back in further a bit to cut more wood, so you buy an ATV and you can still get the same supply in to burn. Year three, you're at the back of the lot. Your supply is exactly the same - you get six cords of wood to burn... but then comes Year Four. You have nothing left but some small maple shrubs now. Suddenly the price you pay to acquire wood to burn goes way up. Fisheries are the same. They completely collapse when very nearly the last schools of fish have been detected and harvested. Until then, the *current* supply is stable, and the price has to stay reasonable or people will buy something else. It's only when boats start coming home empty that the impact of reduced supply will affect the price."}]}

Spirits rarely have the calories and nutrition facts on the bottle because people generally don't really care that much but alcohol itself, provides 7 calories per gram. Alcohol is very basic in your body, your body breaks down the calories from alcohol first. In the same way that lots of carbs can keep you from losing fat because your body breaks down carbs first, it breaks down alcohol before fat so all the time you spend eating well during the day goes down the drain when your body is burning the empty alcohol calories that night. On top of this, it's related to your liver. Your liver is responsible for the processing of fats in your body and breaking them down for energy. However, it's also concerned with the toxins in your body (alcohol is one of these) and can't break down the fats if it's too busy breaking down the alcohol. On top of the damage caused by alcohol to your body, the ways it affects weight loss are basically due to being an empty calories blocking your body from processing and breaking down fats and other sources of calories so they ultimately get stored in your body."}]}

What changed?", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of issue to cover here, but a few easy ones to name led to the decline... The abandonment of the gold standard is one. When our currency was based on a rare metal it was much harder for the dollar to be manipulated. Returning the Panama Canal was another. The canal helped feed the coffers that helped Goverment run. It wasn't a huge hit, but it did take away our abality to control a powerful trade route. Poor trade agreements hurt a lot. We as a country couldn't really compete with countries that subsidized the cost of thier manufactured goods. The implementation of a minimum federal wage under valued labor is some parts of the country, over valued labor in others. Before a federal minimum wage, local markets controlled the price of labor. Pay too little and no one would work for you, pay too much and not be able to afford the price of labor. The cost of labor was tied the cost of living in a more dynamic sense. Now, wages in some parts of the country are too low, and in other too high. Instead of the town/city/state basing pay off of a local scale, it is now tied to federal requirement that ignores a local market. The growth of Goverment. This is a big issue. A major issue. This simple example of how poorly the Goverment spends money is a little old, but should give you a fair idea. No Child Left Behind. For every dollar collected in taxes, on average, 14 cents made it back to the schools. A lot of waste in the Goverment. Too much. The rise of the welfare state. Very simple to explain. We support people who can not support them selves. The Goverment raises taxes to pay for it, people make less take home money, more go on welfare, more taxes are collected to pay for the increase of people on welfare, more people make less take home money, go on welfare.... Wash rise repeat.... Compounded by how bad our Goverment spends money. Federal grants and loans for higher education. So stupid that no one really sees this. Every single year the Goverment increase the amount of money it gives in grants and loans, the cost of higher education is increased to take full advangte of the increased amount of money the Goverment is willing to grant or loan. Have watched this happen for 18 years. No one says anything at all. The rise of the 4th branch of Goverment. The regulator branch. Businesses spend billions to comply with regulations every year. That is money that could be used to hire more people. Insurance for every thing. Once insurance became mandatory, it no longer become affordable. This is very apparent for the current health care insurance we are now required to carry. Tax law. Needs reform. When a majority of people in the country don't pay any taxes at all, we have a problem. I think the biggest single factor though is probably the stupidity of the American people over all. We have become a society that doesn't respect debt and intrest. Very few seem to know how to live with in their means. Wealth is built over time, but requires spending wisely and only when really needed. The average debt most Americans carry has soared in the last 15 years. Edit: spelling"}]}
{"id": "3jimk2", "input": "why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?", "output": [{"answer": "Part of this is the rubber compound used. Track tires are much softer and stickier than a car tire. The other part. Contact. Traction is made by contact. The amount of contact and the amount of friction expressed over that contact area. By using tread you effectively remove some of the contact area. So for instance a tire that is a given compound and has no tread has say 20 square inches of contact. The friction over that area gives a certain amount of total traction. If I use tread then the contact area of the tire goes down, however the friction coefficients will actually go up since the weight of the vehicle is being felt through a smaller area. That will increase the total friction for that patch. For steet tires they need to be able to grip in both dry, wet, etc conditions. A track tire or slick is only really effective in the dry on a clean track. If you look up rain tires for say NASCAR you will see they have tread. It not only concentrates the force (weight/area) but also helps to channel the water from the center of the tire. This allows the grip they would not get if they were still using slicks. Also if you buy a good track tire for say a motorcycle and run it on the street it will wear out very quickly. And would be dangerous if you encounter any kind of debris in the road like sand or gravel."}]}

{"id": "3atjp2", "input": "what are benefits of TPP ?", "output": [{"answer": "The TPP is a trade liberalization treaty with investment and intellectual property provisions, we think. Lots of people will tell you why it's terrible. Maybe they're right. Here's the counterargument: Trade: Asian countries want to sell stuff, Western countries want to sell stuff, we all want to buy stuff. Right now there are innumerable rules limiting what companies and people in different countries can and cannot buy from each other. Trade agreements try to get rid of some of these rules. Why is this good? Because when you can sell to more people, you can make more money. There is also some orthodox (meaning accepted, not necessarily correct) economic theory that says that tariffs create a deadweight loss. None of this is new, the WTO (previously GATT) has existed for ages with the purpose of reducing trade barriers. Will this lead to more jobs going abroad? Maybe. More likely it will hurt low-skilled workers in countries that are better at high skilled things (I.e., if your country decides to specialize in high finance and Internet startups, its going to suck for your welders). Investment: These are the rules that let companies \"sue\" governments for losses. Basically, this is fine for the U.S. but can suck for developing countries. These rules basically say to countries \"if we build a factory in your country, you can't just take it for no reason.\" Developing countries (and developed ones) actually do this from time to time, so the idea is that by promising not to just randomly take shit, countries will attract more foreign companies to invest (ideally creating jobs, paying taxes to the government etc). For companies, it's good because they get to invest in booming countries like Indonesia without as much risk that an irresponsible government will nationalize their money and kick them out on a whim. The problems with this are that 1 sometimes countries need to up and seize private property and 2 foreign investment isn't always as good as it looks in theory (generally developing countries covet foreign investment). In any case, most of the investment protections probably are already contained in other treaties. The U.S. has loads of bilateral investment treaties (look up BITs UNCTAD I'm too lazy to link on mobile). So does China. Japan does not have the same sort of investment protection regime, but the again most people seem to consider Japanese politics relatively stable. So there's your TPP. There's definitely some problems with it but the people who are losing their shit appear to be unaware of any of the developments in international economic law in the last 50 years. Edit: I forgot IP. A lot of developing countries don't have very strong protections for copyrights, patents, etc. American brands would probably like to see fewer rip offs of their products."}]}

How do they measure how they can see and how bad their eyes are when it's literally a baby that can't even walk or talk, let alone read letters aloud from an eye exam?", "output": [{"answer": "Awesome question! (I'm a pediatric optometry resident) So for children too young to give us a reliable subjective \"1 or 2\", we base the prescription on objective measurements. We can objectively measure their refractive error with retinoscopy (as mentioned above). That's when we shine a light in their eyes and use lenses to determine the prescription. It's very versatile, and we don't need a machine so it's perfect for kids. They can do anything (eat, watch tv) as long as their eyes are open for us to get the measurement. In kiddos, it's best to do this when they're dilated because the dilation drops force their eyes to relax their focusing/accommodation ability (which they have a lot of). Kids can accommodate through far sighted prescription/refractive error. Prescriptions for kids under 7 should almost always be determined with dilating drops. It's normal to be a little far sighted when you're young, and as you grow up you tend to become more near sighted. As pediatric optometrists, one of our greatest worries is amblyopia or lazy eye. That's when a child either has an eye turn, or high prescription leading them to favor one eye over the other. The non-favored eye doesn't develop the proper connections in the brain to see 20/20 because the kid will always favor his \"good eye\". That's why you'll see some kids wearing an eye patch. It's to force them to use their \"bad or lazy eye\" so the brain can recognize and developed clear vision through that eye. It's important to treat lazy eye when they're young while the visual system is still malleable."}]}

Piano: When you slide the right joy-con into the cardboard piano, then pressing keys down on the piano makes other things inside the piano move. The joy-con senses what those things are and, judging by the shapes and positions, the Switch is able to tell which keys are being pressed. The Switch then plays notes that go with those keys, so pressing a cardboard key makes the Switch play the note for that key. The piano is small so it won\u2019t have as many keys as a real piano, but it\u2019s a neat start. RC car: Both joy-cons have a rumble feature, meaning that they can vibrate.

{"id": "5j30ge", "input": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "output": [{"answer": "If pathogens are the bad guys and white blood cells are the good guys, pus is the dead bodies of both of them after/ during the fight. White blood cells work by basically eating pathogens, but if the infection is very wide spread the will eat until they gorge themselves until they burst. When they burst they release partially digested pathogens back into the system that are less infectious that what they originally ate. That is basically what pus is. Now this is like on a cellular level and cells are tiny. If you can see like a little bit of pus, like a zit, you can imagine that this is millions of white blood cell remains. Generally speaking if the \"war\" is going this wide spread, the infection is pretty serious. You have to imagine white blood cells like policemen picking up little pathogens here and there all over your body all the time, so when you have a large concentrated area of large infection like a wound or something like a clogged pour, especially one clogged with a foreign object like a tiny rock or piece of dust, your body sends tons of white blood cells into fight the long fight. And that long fight definitely racks up a toll. Pus is the evidence of the wars toll and is generally an indication that the war is both very big and not exactly winning/ won yet, only on going with many large battles still on going. This is why generally if a wound has pus it is considered very serious because it's an indication that your body is fighting as hard as it can to fight the infection and struggling. This is why you treat cuts and scrapes with antibiotics like alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, etc. to prevent things from ever getting to this stage. It's also very hard on your body to have your immune system in like war mode for an extended period of time. Basically you are fighting the infection and pathogens on the outside of your body while your immune system fights it on the inside so the bad guys are fighting a war on two fronts. Your lymph nodes only have so much capacity to make white blood cells and it's important to note that even if your body is fighting a big war with an infection in your body, it's also still policing your body like normal too. If the fight is too long and hard somethings going to give, either your body won't be able to fight the existing infection and start losing ground or more commonly small infections your body would have been able to fight easily will now be too difficult to stop from growing by your over taxed immune system.

It certainly would not visibly occur as quickly as what that gif portrays. One issue with that gif is that it portrays the two galaxies as solid objects which would actually have a physical collision with each other. This isn't so; there's more \"empty\" space in a galaxy than there is physical matter capable of colliding. The greatest effect the two would have on one another would be a gravitational one. A galaxy is held together by the gravity of the whole, and usually in part by a black hole at the center. Galaxies that \"collide\" tend to pull at each other, reshaping both once one has passed through the other, or even merging if they both lose enough speed. There would be very little actual collision, if any. On that note, you probably wouldn't actually see anything unusual unless one star happened to come particularly close to our galaxy. It's possible that the night sky might look a little more populated and that those particular stars might appear to move a little more than our normal ones but the space between stars is so vast, even the closest star to us looks the same as the furthest one to the naked eye."}]}
{"id": "2c4xvg", "input": "Why do buildings have gravel on top of them?", "output": [{"answer": "The layer of gravel on a low slope / flat roof is used to help keep the underlay fabric secured and to provide some protection from the elements and human interference. This roof type is typically composed of overlapping layers of tar paper or rubber sheeting separated by tar. Putting a thin layer of gravel (usually river gravel for the smooth edges) on top of the top tar layer will keep the tar from running as much during hot weather thus reducing the risk of a leak developing. It also provides a safer, cleaner, more stable footing for anyone on the roof, as well as protecting the roof from that person's weight. It keeps hailstones, errant baseballs, etc. from damaging the waterproof seal created by the paper and tar, as well as helping to keep the layers in place. Flat roofs in my experience are seldom totally flat. Most of the ones I have been up on had a tiny bit of slope to them to feed water to the edges for removal.

{"id": "60z1mh", "input": "How does this vinegar/baking soda hot ice reaction work?", "output": [{"answer": "Good question. This is a crystallization from a supersaturated solution. How this works... a liquid can dissolve different amounts of material depending on the temperature. By boiling the water, you are able to increase the water's ability to dissolve material. What is happening in the gif is the water is brought to a boil and the maximum amount of material (in this case sodium acetate) is dissolved. This hot solution of water and sodium acetate is transferred to the glass container to cool down. Once the solution has cooled down it contains more sodium acetate than it normally would be able to dissolve while at room temperature. This is called \"supersaturated.\" Supersaturated solutions are really good at growing crystals. Once a small amount of sodium acetate left over from the bottom of the pan is placed in the supersaturated solution (in the gif this is a small crystal on the end of the wooden dowel) the sodium acetate in solution begins to crystalize. TLDR: Boiling water can dissolve more material than cold water. Boil water, add max amount of material. Cool water down and there is \"too much\" material in the water. This \"too much\" material will form crystals in the water."}]}

Couldn't the average person hear a train coming long before it reaches them?", "output": [{"answer": "Modern high speed trains do no make a lot of noise (listen for example to  URL_0 ). And (at least in europe) they are going quite fast, so even when you do hear them you only have seconds to move out of the way. And due to the Doppler effect the sound you hear isn't directly associated with a train in your brain but rather a high whistle. You can prolly notice the train the best because the tracks start to hum, but if you don't associate that with a train you could be dead in a few seconds. A train driver might sound the horn, but if he's on a long track and just staring ahead, you might very well be in his blind spot and he won't notice you until he's a few hundred meters away. A train traveling at 250km/h only needs 5 seconds to travel 350 meters and you won't hear it at that distance, especially not if it isn't a straight track or it is lined with trees. And the best reason to avoid train tracks: You will scare the train driver to death every time he sees you walking between the tracks and he has to apply the emergency brakes, blow the whistle (and if he's smart he'll look away in the last few seconds). He doesn't know if you're trying to commit suicide or if you are just plain stupid. Crossing tracks just before a train or even worse; walking on train tracks can give those drivers serious mental issues, especially when they did run over someone before."}]}
{"id": "27a31a", "input": "do black holes \"move\" through space?", "output": [{"answer": "Black holes have a lot of mystique and awe around them, but they really aren't that complicated. If you live somewhere with snow, you have probably played around with the basic concepts. Imagine we start with a cloud. It is really big. Then the cloud gets compacted. Parts of the cloud condense. It turns into snowflakes. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. The snow falls to the ground. What was once a very large part of cloud has the same mass, but is now a smaller pile of snow. Then you compact it some more. You start with a small pile of snow, compress it, and you have a snowball. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. It might be the size of a baseball. Compact it some more, you have a small iceball. It might be the size of a golf ball. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. That is exactly what happens with a black hole. The same is true for planets and for stars, black holes, and even the super massive black holes in a galactic core. Let's see how. Start with a big gas nebula. It can be hundreds of millions of miles across. But it is very sparse, like a cloud. Collapse part of the nebula and you get a star, some planets, asteroids, comets, and other material. It is much like collapsing your cloud to snowflakes. Perhaps a big star, perhaps a yellow giant or a blue hypergiant. Let's say it is a 10 million mile diameter yellow giant. The Sun is about one million miles across for comparison. Push and compact a giant star and eventually it will collapse into a neutron star. Just like collapsing your pile of snow into a snowball. It is very small and whitish, but has the same amount of stuff as the star before it. It has the same amount of gravity, just squished a bit more. The star collapses from roughly ten million miles down to roughly five miles. It shrinks to about a millionth of the size, but it still has the same amount of mass. The planets and other objects will still orbit at the same distance, assuming they survived the giant explosion that took place when it collapsed. When you read online about a supernova, it can be caused by one of the giant stars collapsing this way. The big difference with a neutron star is that since it is compressed so much, it shrunk from ten million miles to just five miles, things can get MUCH closer to the central mass. If a comet or asteroid or planet gets too close, it won't be able to escape and will eventually crash into the star. Other than that, it still has the same amount of mass, the same amount of gravity, the same amount of matter that the giant star had. It is just squished together tighter. Collapse it again and it turns into a black hole. It still has the same gravity, but because it has collapsed the things near the center are able to get closer to the central mass. What started as a ten million mile star, or a hundred million mile nebula, or a five mile neutron star, has been squished down to the size of a large marble, probably just a few inches across. It still has the same amount of stuff in it, and again any nearby planets or other objects orbiting it that survive the explosion will continue to orbit exactly the same. It gets so small, so tight, that now stuff that could have only come within a few miles of it can now come within inches of it. Just like before, things that get too close cannot escape, and will eventually crash into the star. The difference is that at some distance near the star, perhaps only a mile or two away from the tiny marble, not even light can escape directly. But these very tiny objects still have the same mass, 10^32 or 10^33 kg of mass, just squished down really tight. Black holes are just really squished stars. A cloud that was once millions of miles across has been squished down to the size of a marble. They still move around, they still do what stars do, they are still just a really tightly compacted iceball. The only difference between a black hole and a star is they are just so squished that light has a hard time escaping. Anyway, the centers of galaxies are super massive black holes. They are like thousands of stars that have been squished down, just like you can squash a whole yard worth of snow into one snowman. The stars are squished and squished and squished, maybe down to the size of a basketball or the size of a small building. They might have a mass of 10^36 kg, give or take an order of magnitude. They have so much mass that millions of stars (including black holes) orbit around them. These galactic cores also move around. We have a local cluster of galaxies that are all moving around. The galactic cores, those collections of super massive black holes, are moving in their own dance around the universe. We have the Canis Major Galaxy, and the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, that are already crashing into the Milky Way Galaxy. We are on a collision course with another, the Andromeda Galaxy. It was just on the news that scientists updated when the Milky Way is expected to crash into Andromeda. We still have around 3 billion years, so we'll be long dead, but our Sun will likely entering old age when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda and will probably become a big elliptical galaxy. Our local cluster of galaxies is part of an even larger dance with other clusters of galaxies, all moving around crashing into each other."}]}

But sometimes it can have indirect benefits. Salt Lake City might have lost money in the short term, but showing the world you are a great ski destination is probably still earning them benefits today. A lot of it comes down to prestige. The Olympics makes places like Lake Placid and Lillehammer household names, doubly so if they pull them off well. Often an advanced developing country, like say Brazil, will see hosting as a step towards sitting at the grown-up table in international affairs. Unfortunately, they will often overreach and make bids too favorable to the IOC, resulting in an event thing can't afford. This also can result in a poorly executed event that actually hurts their prestige. Also, the IOC has a pretty extensive history of corruption when it comes Olympic bids. The games are sometimes are awarded to countries who can only host them with great hardship, so long as the right people got paid off. Then corrupt politicians find ways to divert all the government money being spent into their own pockets. That is part of the reason only highly developed countries are able to break even. They already have much of the needed infrastructure and less corruption, which reduces costs significantly. A country like Germany could probably throw the games together in half the time for significantly less expense."}]}

Social Security Numbers have no built-in safeguards, because they were originally just the number that the Social Security Administration used to figure out who you were a little quicker. They could, and still can, look you up based on other information. It was just an Account Number, and those don't need to be secure since the security is in the other associated information. Things went wrong when the IRS needed a way to identify people. The effort to make a National ID System got shot down because they were associated with the Nazis... so the IRS grabbed onto the next best thing: Social Security Numbers. Most people weren't required to get a SSN until they actually entered the workforce, but you *could* request one sooner. In order to encourage more people to get numbers, the IRS tied the Dependent Tax Break to the SSN of the child you're claiming on your taxes. Before that, the Dependent Tax Break ran on the Honor System.  >  Side Note:  >  There was a significant drop in the juvenile population, as far as the IRS could tell, when they started requiring a SSN associated with the child. Such is the effectiveness of the Honor System when money is at stake. The Social Security Administration *discouraged* the IRS, because (as the old Social Security Cards used to say on their face) the SSN was not meant to be a method of identification. However, the IRS's use of the SSN for tax-records made using a SSN as ID look like a good idea to a lot of people. Thus... more groups began to do it. That eventually brings us to today... and that insecure number being deathly important."}]}

This was one factor in the decision to spin the restaurant chains off into a separate business. That is just the USA. There is a whole, big world out there.

Yes, features tend to shoot at a much slower pace, but production generally accounts for a relatively small percentage of overall time spent on a project. The biggest difference is when it comes to editing. A feature will often spend several months just in editing. First, the editor will get a first cut up and running, which can take a couple of weeks past the end of shooting. Then the director will come in and make changes\u2014this can take weeks to several months. Often the producers will also chime in, and sometimes (especially if it's a new, unestablished director), they will exercise creative control over the project, and a lot of horse trading goes on between the director and the producers (and on bigger projects, the studio gets input as well) over what the final cut will look like. While this is going on, there's a lot of other stuff that's just getting started. Visual effects are being planned out, bid out to companies, sent out, reviewed, and so on. This usually doesn't even start to happen until well into the editorial process. Music is being decided on. Composers are being interviewed, and then the music has to actually be written. Existing music has to be licensed. The sound design is starting to take form. At this point, there's often audience testing, which is generally a huge waste of time and effort, but producers and studios insist on doing it anyway. And what's worse is they'll make changes, often substantial ones, based on the opinion of between 20 and 300 people who just watched a rough, unfinished version of the movie with temp music, sound effects, VFX shots, and so on. A movie that tests poorly can sometimes drag on for several months as changes are made, or maybe they'll even do a week or two of reshooting. Finally, the picture is locked, which means that they're done editing. Now the sound design really begins. Dialogue lines are cleaned up, or selected to be re-recorded and replaced (this is called ADR). Sound effects are added, and music is scored and put into the film. Meanwhile, the picture is being brought \u201conline\u201d\u2014they take the cut and recreate it from the high quality raw footage, as opposed to the lower quality \u201coffline\u201d media that was used to edit the film. The director of photography will usually come in and oversee the color correction process. Final visual effect shots will be inserted. This whole process (picture and sound) can take as much as a month or two, sometimes even more if it's a really complicated film. Lastly, it all comes together at the final mix. The online picture is taken and played back against the final sound design, and levels are adjusted, sound effects and such that are deemed extraneous are removed, tweaks to the music are made, and the movie looks and sounds the best it ever will. All in all, it's taken a minimum of six months of post-production to get here, and a year or more is not unheard of. The thing is, I've very rarely heard of a movie locking picture and finishing without any further changes. I've worked on films that have changed literally dozens of times after picture was supposedly \u201clocked\u201d. Each change lengthens the overall process by at least a day or two, and sometimes as much as several weeks if the changes are fairly substantial. Those changes add up quickly. The thing is that there's no real pressure to get the movie done on any reasonable time frame, so everyone wants to take as long as possible to do everything. Why not? There's always more work that can be done, and as long as there's money to keep paying people, you can stave off unemployment for that much longer. As they say, art is never finished, it's abandoned. Now, contrast this to a typical TV series. They've got an air date, and that's non-negotiable. So everything *has* to get done on a schedule that is backtimed from that air date. The editor's cut for a show might take a day or two, the director gets maybe another day or two, and then the producers (writer-producers are invariably the driving creative force in TV, not directors) come in and lock picture. And that's it. It goes to the sound department, VFX are rushed through, music is added, and the show is put on the air. I've been on shows that have made changes within a week or two of the airdate, and there's very much a sense of emergency, because things *have* to get done on time. There is no alternative. Not only that, but the pipeline can run in parallel\u2014you can be doing sound and music on one show, while editing another and shooting a third. Often shows will have multiple editors working on different episodes, and unlike in features where editors usually see the movie through the whole process to the final mix, editors are there to edit picture, and *that's it*. The bottom line is that work expands to fill available time, and since there's a time pressure in TV things get done faster because they have to."}]}

Of course you do, what a silly question! But what if I told you that you don't *always* know logic? But I'm getting ahead of myself already, let's talk about general memory first, shall we? Good! Now, every time you recall a memory, an electric signal goes through your brain. This sounds scary but it's fine, you're brain is meant to do that. Those electrical signals are quite important. Those signals we call neurons (or so my memory claims, correct me if I'm mixing up terms). Neurons have a habbit of inviting their friends, other neurons they often hang out with. They hang out together because they go to the same places, the neurons that hold the name of your best friend and the neurons that hold the face of your best friend usualy go to the conversation with your best friend together. So what does all this has to do with dreams? Well, not so fast! I'm getting there! First, think about how you got here, on this threat, on this sub-reddit, on this site, today. What did you do before this? And before that? You can probably remember all the way to this morning if you try hard enough. That's because the neurons who hold those information already started to become friends (or at least know each other a bit) and so, when you ask the neurons of your latest memory to come back and give you a recapp, it will take the neurons from the event before that with him aswell. If you ask him for a recap, he might invite the neurons of the event before that to come too! But... how is it possible that those neurons already know each other well enough to invite them when you want to remember stuff? Because of logic. There is a special part of your brain dedicated to handeling logic. We trust logic. Every neuron is friends with logic. Thanks to logic, you can recreate the events of your memory, and the things you have forgotten can be filled to some extend thanks to logic. Even if you might not remember getting dressed, if you are wearing clothes. You probably did dress this morning. This 'realisation' might actualy trigger the neurons holding the memory of you putting on your clothes this morning. Now, when you dream, your brain is cleaning up after itself. To do that, it disables the part of your brain that handles logic. That's right, no logic for you. Let me give you an example of what kind of effects that has during a dream; Once I dreamt I went through a hallway in an appartment building, I went through a door, did something, and left through that very same door, when I left that room I was on a boat. And the strangest thing is; I didn't thought it was strange at all. My brain did not realize it was strange because it had no concept of logic at the time. Not only that, but in the dream I went right onto the next event. I never really have any moment in my dreams to just do nothing. While I might not remember it, I know I was constantly doing something whereas, while I'm writing this very comment, I take a moment every now and then to just sit and think. By thinking and recalling what I just wrote the neurons holding that information become better friends. Therefor, I'm able to remember what I wrote much better because I only have to remember one part and the neurons inviting each other will do the rest. So yeah, that's basicly it. In your dreams you never take any time to think about what just happened, and therefor the neurons don't really know each other and won't invite each other at the next party. Mr Popular - our logic system - was asleep during your dreams so he can't help you fill in the gabs of your memory because, quite simply, it doesn't make sense what happens in your dreams. This is why you can't remember your dreams."}]}
{"id": "7y0j18", "input": "Why are Spain and Portugal under Franco and Salazar considered \"merely\" authoritarian and not fascist like Italy and Germany under Mussolini and Hitler?", "output": [{"answer": "Fascism comes from the roman word Fascis which means a bundle. Essentially, it's the ideal of a unified, strong, monoculture. Fascism is the idea that one particular group represents an ideal, that people not belonging to that group are detrimental to that ideal, and that the most important thing is to be unified. It believes in unquestioning acceptance of the norm and of authority so long as that authority is in the same culture. It believes that essentially anything goes towards outsiders. Violence, war, murder is OK as long as it benefits your group. Questioning, wavering, disobedience, free-thinking is antithetical. Fascism is about Autarky- self-sufficient, self-reliant, strong, ignoring tradition, ignoring the weak, banding the strong with the strong, improving themselves by excising the parts they feel bring them down. Authoritarianism is about who controls power. If a government is authoritarian, they are going to be making rules unilaterally, and enforcing them strongly. This doesn't mean fascist, it just means authoritarian. On the other hand, a fascist government is necessarily authoritarian because a key concept is the unquestioning loyalty to authority. Fascism is when you start to side with your faction regardless of the outcome, agree with your faction regardless of the truth, call those who disagree with your faction traitors, distance yourself from, hate or exile people within your faction for expressing views opposite to the prevailing thought, feel that your importance is tied to the importance of your faction, become unwilling to accept individuals from outside of your faction, willing hurt individuals outside of your faction without remorse but are unwilling to tolerate any injury to anyone within your faction without exception (though if the injured individual is found to be not worthy of being in the faction after the fact, then it's OK). If you start to parrot the lies that your leader says, and attack anyone who calls the leader out on their lies. If you start to dismiss anyone who disagrees with the leader as not a \"real\" member of the faction and work to distance them from the faction, if you think that your faction is strong, and the mere presence of outsiders is weakening the faction, and that they should be removed, punished or killed. These are the things that lead to fascism. Authoritarianism is about how a government acts. Do they make the rules themselves? Do they enforce them harshly? Are they unwilling to compromise? Do they ignore the will of the people if it doesn't suit them?"}]}

For example if your dog's name is Fido, he doesn't understand Fido's place in the world. They do recognize there names, it's a bit of an illusion though. For example if you have two dogs, and you give one of them a treat when you say Fido, and the other when you say Clifford, they learn that the respective words only apply to them. Fido knows he will never get a treat when he hears Clifford and Clifford knows he will never get a treat when he hears Fido. So do they know that \"they are Fido,\" or they are \"Clifford,\" no, but they can recognize the command only applies to them. You can take this pretty far, for example you can say Fido come, and they will learn only to come if their name proceeds. However you can do this w/ a two syllable command. For example teach your dog to leave a treat on the floor until you say okay. Then start saying things like Oklahoma or Oh Boy. The dog can be trained to only move on okay. So when you expand this to \"Fido come,\" they aren't learning \"the name,\" they are learning the multiple syllables that apply to them as they don't understand them as \"words,\" either. Which you can further break down just using random sounds. Dogs will even learn that different whistles apply to different dogs and so on. Edit: For reference regarding \"scent tests.\"  URL_0 "}]}

However it removes a lot of water so turning down the temperature to a slow simmer provides a similar temperature control effect, while conserving water. Many sauces and stove top meals account for the loss of water by adding more than is needed."}]}
{"id": "16xhi4", "input": "What exactly does Crystal Meth do to someone? What's so addicting about it?", "output": [{"answer": "Crystal Meth is a stimulant in the amphetamine class of drugs. So it is similar to some other drugs like d-amphetamine (speed). Once you use the drug, it finds its way all through your body and because the molecule is lipophilic it passes through the blood brain barrier very easily. In other words, crystal meth has a molecule that \"likes\" to interact with fat-like things. If you know any chemistry, you know that water and oil (lipids, fat) don't mix very well. So you can think of molecules being either \"water loving\" or \"fat loving\", which means they mix well with one or the other, but usually not both. There are molecules that can mix with both, and that's what a soap or detergent is. Anyway, meth is \"fat loving\" which makes it go easily into the brain, even though your brain has something called a blood brain barrier, which is like a protective layer that doesn't let things go into the brain very easily. Once the meth is in the brain it does something very similar to other stimulants, it make it so that a bunch of the neurons (brain cells) that have this chemical called \"dopamine\", release this chemical into your brain, along with some other chemicals (serotonin and norepinephrine). These chemicals in the brain is what causes the high. Dopamine is the chemical in your brain that makes you feel good. So when you eat your favorite meal, your brain releases dopamine to make you happy that you ate the meal. But this works for things like getting a good grade on a test, which makes you feel happy and well about the test. This dopamine chemical is also important for your brain to remember what things make you feel good. So your brain will make a memory that when you got a good grade on a test you felt good, and it will try to get your body to do that again. Now imagine someone taking meth, their brain becomes flooded with this chemical. It is released much more than when you get a good grade. So much that your brain starts to run out of, and when it does, that's when you crash. Then the brain works really fast to make more of it, and store it for the future. Now about addiction. When someone decides to do meth for the first time, they want to do it usually because they think that it will make them feel really good and happy. So the first time they do it, they enjoy it a lot. Well, once you have done it, you may want to do it again, because you remember how good it felt. So you go ahead and use meth again. Except that the more you use meth, the more your brain gets this \"flood\" of dopamine (the chemical from before). However, the brain isn't supposed to have this happen, a normal brain never has that much dopamine around. So the brain starts to \"think\": Jeez, there is something weird going on here, all this dopamine is not normal, but if this is going to happen all the time I need to do something about it. So what happens is, the brain will start \"telling\" the brain cells that this flood is going to happen again. So in order to help the brain stay \"normal\" (normal being not make you feel super great, which is weird for the brain) it tells all your brain cells to respond less to the dopamine. It's a bit like inflation in the economy, if things cost more money, workers need to get paid more, but then their employer needs to make more money too, so they increase the price of what they sell. Because the brain is trying to avoid this dopamine flood from making it all weird again, it increases how much dopamine you need to feel the effects. Not only that, but it makes it so that the brain is not making as much dopamine either, so when the person isn't using meth, they have less dopamine in their brain than a normal person that doesn't use meth. This is what makes the addict feel depressed and sad when they are not using meth. That's why it's not a good idea to mess around with your brain like that."}]}

{"id": "1q8oum", "input": "What happens in the hospital after a person gets shot? Do they just remove the bullet and stitch the person up?", "output": [{"answer": "Typically the hospital will get advanced notification that a trauma is arriving, so the appropriate people will be in the trauma bay ready to receive the patient as soon as they arrive. In the trauma bay, there is a standardized trauma protocol, and it can be pretty detailed, down to the point of denoting who stands where (e.g. trauma surgery to the right of chest, resident on left side. ED doctor at head of bed. ED nurse at right leg, etc). Everyone has jobs to do and multiple things will happen at once, with people shouting out what they're doing and what's going on. In high volume centers, this is more organized, in lower volume centers it can be more chaotic. The goal here is to stabilize, identify injuries and then prepare for the next step, so depending on the degree of injury, patients will be getting IV fluid, often blood transfusions or a breathing tube. They'll also get a chest tube if needed at this time (if the lung was shot). Once they're stabilized to some degree, then they can go to the operating room. With arms and legs surgery involves exploring the area, mostly to control bleeding. The bullet (if present) is taken out and then they're closed back up. If it's in the abdomen, then an exploratory laparotomy is performed, where the belly is opened and all the contents checked for injury. Injured structures are either repaired or removed (depending on viability). Depending on severity of injury, the belly may be left open (e.g. skin not sewn back together). If it's in the chest (and they survived), they'll already have a chest tube from the trauma bay. If the bullet goes in the skull (and they survived), they'll get a craniotomy, which allows the neurosurgeon to decompress the brain and address any bleeding. The brain isn't explored and the bullet is typically left in place. The goals of all these surgery is to control bleeding and repair damage, not to take the bullet out, but bullets that are seen are typically removed. (This is how things work in a Trauma center in the US, it's probably different in other environments)."}]}
{"id": "5firsf", "input": "How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide?", "output": [{"answer": "I think something that can be confusing is the naming of these drugs. We call these drugs \"**anti**-depressants\", there are other like \"**anti**-psychotics\". These names are misleading because it implies that the drugs have a specific mechanistic effect against the symptoms. This is like giving alcohol to someone who has social anxiety and because it makes them less inhibited and more confident we then call it \"**anti**- social anxiety\" medicine. Of course most people intuitively understand that alcohol is not correcting something in the brain of people with social anxiety. It is simply changing their mental state in a way that masks the original symptoms. It would be silly to think that these people have an alcohol deficiency. Anti-depressant drugs are not really known to have a specific effect against some underlying cause of depression. They are simply changing a persons mental state just as other drugs do. Once we start thinking of the drugs in this way then we can start to understand how they might have unexpected effects. For example, 70-80% of people who take SSRI antidepressants experience some form of sexual dysfunction. This is because the drugs disrupt normal serotonin function in the brain, and serotonin is important for sexual function. One of the negative side effects that some people can experience is called akathisia. This term is a little broad but it essentially means that people can become extremely restless almost like they are having a \"depression attack\" which is similar to a panic attack only instead of anxiety building up it is depression and feelings of despair and hopelessness. This can be extremely disturbing and make people feel like the only way out is to harm themselves. This may be the reason why in large trials there are more suicidal events in the drug group than placebo, because some people experience this side effect. It also explains many of the anecdotes of people who were prescribed SSRIs for off-label conditions such as sleep, who had no history of depression, and they subsequently went on to commit suicide very suddenly after taking the drugs. I should point out that this is not a mainstream view. Most doctors and psychiatrists will tell you that the reason why people commit suicide is because the drug is helping them and giving them more energy. However there is no evidence to back this up and it doesn't explain suicides of those without mental illness. In my view it is much more likely that the drugs are harming people than helping them. If you interact with a complex system (our brains) in ways you don't fully understand, you are far more likely to cause disruption than to enhance function. The problem is that any drug that causes a side effect that is also a symptom of the illness it is used to treat can be easy to overlook. Since people who are depressed are more likely to commit suicide, someone who does so while taking an anti-depressant is not thought of as being particularly unusual and it is easy to \"pin the blame\" on the depression as opposed to the drug."}]}
{"id": "69mgc8", "input": "if blue eyes are recessive then how did they manage to originally spread to so many people?", "output": [{"answer": "Blue eyes are what are called Autosomal recessive (this isn't necessarily 100% true, but it is good enough we can work with it). Autosomal recessive means that both alleles (meaning genes that you get from your parents) need to be recessive in order to be expressed in the offspring. Now lets say that this blue eyed person's alleles are represented by 'rr'. A person needs two little 'r's, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here's where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as 'Rr'. If the father has the same 'Rr' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting 'rr' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with 'Rr', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn't being expressed. A one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an 'r' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person's chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned). In short Because a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population. Edit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits."}]}

That is total bullshit. Games depict violence, normalize violence and contain violence as a central theme because of the very nature of games. In most games, and video games are no exception, you have winners and you have losers; you have win conditions and you have fail-states. Imagining a game where victory is achievable through violent means is easy; you win, you live and progress, you lose, you die and go no further. Now imagine what a game would look like if its core mechanic was sexual in nature. What is your win condition? Getting to have sex? Getting married? You can't gamify sexual content without doing one or all of the following: * alienating half of all possible users by making your win-state a relationship with a woman, thus losing the interest of all possible people attracted to men * alienating everyone that doesn't find the \"win-state\" of your game to be even desirable. ie. how do you make your game-girl universally appealing to everyone in your male audience * Objectifying women/men by making your win condition a relationship. A trophy. These games exist, they are called dating sims and they are very niche products which many people find creepy or demeaning. Imagine if mainstream gaming depicted sexuality and relationships to the degree it does violence, and how much more damaging that would be to people's ability to form meaningful real-world relationships. Violence on the other hand is more universal, more immediately identifiable, and more easily translated into a game. Not only that, but people understand that there is a time and place for violence, that society universally condemns the use of extreme violence to solve our problems, whereas sexuality and its expression is more nuanced. **TL;DR** games are violent because winning and losing is clearer, less morally grey, and easier to understand than if the goals and subject matter of the game was sexual"}]}

Whole individual is the one considered unethical, and what we'll talk about. Anyway, there's a couple issues here: 1. Cloning technology has a long way to go. . Clones don't live nearly as long as naturally conceived members of the species, and have all kinds of health problems. To create a human clone would be to deliberately create a living, thinking individual who will never have a normal life due to health complications caused by the cloning process. That is considered very unethical. 2. Some are concerned that clones wouldn't have the same rights as regular humans, and may be created only to provide genetically-identical replacement organs and the like for transplant into the original. 3. What you're describing - creating a new individual to give a better life to than you had - applied to just having children normally.

My degree background is in Psycholinguistics, which is basically put: understanding how language functions in the brain. I actually did a research project on dyslexia and hope I can be a help explaining it. So, symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system. This basically means that the language is communicate (in writing systems) through logos, or symbols, representing - usually - a \"chunk\" or what is called a morpheme. A combination of these morphemes in a particular pattern and combination represent a word or phrase. Languages like English are considered alphabetic (cause - you know - the alphabet). There's a lot of different things to consider you'd need more information from studying to field, but basically our ability to read has mapped on to previously developed parts of the brain, utilizing their functions to process language. For alphabetic system, they are usually called \"t-junctions\" meaning before modern times, letter like the \"o\" weren't actually round, but were a series of lines making almost a diamond shape that has altered over the years to the circular \"o\" we all know and love. Alphabetic languages actually access a part of the brain (which I can't currently recall) that has to do with your lexical phonetic storage system - meaning you link the letter to a specific sound (with has its variations between words in English... but that's a different topic all together). That is how it is simply organized. Logographic systems actually activate parts of the visual cortex not activated in alphabetic systems (or only activated minimally). There are actually MRI testing that has been done on this demonstrating the results. What's really cool is the fact that because these two systems of writing/reading don't full connect, a person who is dyslexic in one system, such as English, could be fully able to read and write with easy in another system, like Japanese, because of this lack of overlap between logographic and alphabet systems (you can find case studies on this which are actually pretty rad!) There is much debate as to why dyslexia happens in the first place, but some of the best journal articles dispute that it has to do with the fact that writing and reading is a relatively new systems to our brains, and might have to do with the fact we are utilizing previous skills for other task that have evolved in our brain, to map the ability to read and write and make it accessible.

To be strictly correct, PRISM (\"Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management\") itself is simply the name of a tool used to access data gathered by the NSA by presumably legal means (in accordance with FISA / Protect America Act). I have now edited the post for accuracy. Be aware that as more information has come out, much of the related speculation has been disproved, at least so far as PRISM itself is concerned, and the articles upon which this post was originally based are themselves no longer the latest information on the subject. ------------ Ok, for now I've finished editing. I've removed all the inaccurate information I could find, and replaced most of the original post with the most accurate information I could find, to the best of my knowledge. Please bring any inaccuracies you find to my attention. ------------ Below is a slightly abridged version of the highlights from the following article: [CNET FAQ]( URL_1 ) This has replaced the previously posted information as it was not accurate. **What is PRISM?** PRISM stands for \"Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management,\" and is a \"data tool\" designed to collect and process \"foreign intelligence\" that passes through American servers. It has now been acknowledged by the Obama administration. In the words of national security reporter Marc Ambinder, \"PRISM [is] a kick-ass GUI that allows an analyst to look at, collate, monitor, and cross-check different data types provided to the NSA from Internet companies located inside the United States.\" **It only targets foreigners?** PRISM \"cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen (PDF), or any other U.S. person, or to intentionally target any person known to be in the United States, according to a statement released by Director Clapper on June 8. **So how does this affect an American's data?** The key word is intentional. The NSA can't intentionally target an Americans data. But analysts need only be at least 51 percent confident of a target's \"foreignness.\" **What is PRISM not?** It is apparently not the name for an overarching secret surveillance program in affiliation with certain large tech companies, as was originally reported by The Washington Post. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has released a statement saying, \"PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\" Instead, the name PRISM appears to refer to the actual computer program used to collect and analyze data legally requested by the NSA and divulged by Internet companies. This matches reports from CNET and The New York Times. However, as the New York Times reported late Friday evening, it has come to light that the nine large tech companies first reported to be working with the NSA to divulge information have, in fact, made it easier for the government to access data from their servers. **Which companies are involved?** Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, Google, Apple, PalTalk, YouTube, and Skype. Dropbox is allegedly \"coming soon.\" However, 98 percent of PRISM production is based on just Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft. All nine of them have explicitly denied that the government has \"direct access\" to their servers. Reliable sources have confirmed to CNET that PRISM works on a request-by-request basis, rather than unfettered access, as was originally reported by the Washington Post. Here is a direct quote from our in-depth article on this issue:  > Those reports are incorrect and appear to be based on a misreading of a leaked Powerpoint document, according to a former government official who is intimately familiar with this process of data acquisition and spoke today on condition of anonymity. **So someone has read my e-mail?** Aside from the fact that Google's algorithms crawl your e-mail all the time to target ads at you, \"someone\" within the NSA/FBI/etc may have read your e-mails, *presumably with a proper warrant*. **Should I be outraged?** Probably! But maybe not. President Obama addressed PRISM on Friday and essentially said, \"Don't worry. You can trust us.\" **Is it even legal?** Yes, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 2008 and the Protect America Act of 2007. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement Thursday night saying that \"Section 702 is a provision of FISA that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States.\" FISA was renewed last year by Congress. **How does it work?** Essentially like this: The attorney general issues a secret order to a tech company to hand over access to its servers to the FBI. The FBI then hands that information over to the NSA. This account matches what CNET has been told by our reliable source:  > When the government delivers Section 702 orders, according to a former official, companies \"implement them just as though they would implement a wiretap -- there's no direct access to servers.\" The order has to be for account information or an intercept directed at a specific foreign person, and \"you can't say everyone in Pakistan who searched for 'X'... It still has to be particularized.\" According to CNET's source, both the contents of communications and metadata, such as information about who's talking to whom, can be requested. **What's the fallout?** Well, so far respected human rights watchdog Freedom House has downgraded America's freedom ranking. Last time their survey was released, the United States was the second most free country on Earth in terms of Internet freedoms. That position is about to change. **How can I avoid this?** You can't. **What happens next?** A congressional hearing and an investigation into who leaked it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans,\" Clapper said in his statement. So the answer is, nothing much.

{"id": "2ozr9o", "input": "Why does the price of gold fluctuate so much?", "output": [{"answer": "Economist here: First I would have to ask you whether you really understand what \"fluctuate\" means. It means go up and down, up and down, up and down... I really don't think that's what's happening to gold. [Here's a good webpage to check past trends and historical gold price]( URL_1 ). There's just a couple of periods where there's high *fluctuation* - most notably summer 2011 - summer 2012 but otherwise it's more or less a simple up or down trend. There are minor fluctuations but those are the result of how markets work - it's never smooth. The reason for some of the drastic changes however are quite simple. Gold is a very secure store of value in times of crisis compared to paper money, debt instruments and other commodities. It is important to realize that gold never \"goes up\" as much as everything else goes down. Gold only appreciates when other financial commodities become volatile and it's the result of flight of capital - people moving their money from falling currencies or risky treasury bills to gold. Gold is always worth as much as gold - unlike fiat instruments (created by government decree or a contract) it does have an *intrinsic value* and if enough people want it then supply and demand - boom - the price goes up. That's what happened in 2010-2012 because everyone first thought Dollar was finished and Euro would take the crown and then it turned out that Euro is actually weaker than the Dollar and people started running to gold - some to protect capital, others because they were expecting that and hoped gold will skyrocket. The year 2012 was the most volatile period but after it turned out that no Armageddon comes people started looking to re-coup losses somewhere else. Again - gold is just a good store of value and appreciates only in panic times. So they went looking for more profitable instruments and the outflow of capital tanked the gold price. In the late 90s and early 00s gold was at some of its lowest because many government sold their stocks so that meant that supply grew and outstripped demand. Then when the crisis hit some of the countries - IIRC Russia and China among them - bought some gold to try and hedge at least some of their currency reserves. The reason why gold goes up and down \"like crazy\" is because gold is a very scarce resource (unless you're Indian) and the buyers are typically hedge funds and governments. So they're either buying or selling in bulk - therefore affecting the price more than ordinary consumer market would. It makes the market also more susceptible to speculation - which is why people talk about the \"gold bubble\" in  URL_0  certainly was one. Still the price is around 1200 usd right now so it's still three times the base low in the mid-00s. when during the boom and because of those extra gold sales an ounce was worth less than 400 usd. Interestingly enough however many countries make trading gold very difficult for ordinary people. But why it is done - is a story for another day."}]}

For me I had a horrible first time experience with it and I will likely never try it again because of it. On a personal level I was not ready to try it and I suffered the loss of my father some months before it. But for whatever reason I thought I could try it. It was a party and the mood seemed right at first. I had tried mushrooms before a few times and I thoroughly enjoyed those experiences. The difference between acid and shrooms in my opinion is that the high of shrooms comes on naturally and organically. Visually the effects feel external. You have a natural sense of boundary from your sense of self and the trip. However acid is another animal. I felt as if my mind was being manipulated and that things were permanently changing. I feared never coming down from it. I thought to myself, am I going to see polygons and and eyes bugging out of the tv from now on? And I\u2019ll have to lie to people to pretend to act like a sane person? Now don\u2019t get me wrong the first few hours or so were great. Everything was hilarious. The moon looked incredible. One thing that was scary though was that I got caught in the loop. My friend and I walked to the back yard to look at the moon and admire how awesome it was. We walked around and came back to the same spot and had the exact same conversation. I thought it was low key terrifying. I also felt like the backyard was going on forever and I just had to explore and see the back of it. Yet my rational self was saying, \u201cwell that\u2019s a good way to wander in a neighbors yard and get shot \u201c. The trees however looked badass. They looked like N64 Zelda tree graphics. Now the ego death part was hell. I was confronted with a lot of fears and terrible sense of guilt and shame. That I wasn\u2019t enough and that I would not live up to be what I think and what my family and peers think I am capable of. I ended up crying my eyes out almost uncontrollably. I will likely never try the stuff again. I do not want to revisit the experience. Still I believe it was something to learn from and a bit of wake up call for myself. Now the other sense of ego death seems to be that you lose the idea that anything is about you. You become more in tune with everything around you. That sounds pretty awesome. Not like mine lol."}]}

The current government was elected with a large majority, and is basically a democratic government, supported by many people, including many of the rural poor. This threatens the oligarchy, which has held the real power behind the scenes for basically all of Thailand's history. So at the beginning of the month you had the courts, which have sided with the oligarchy, ruling that the prime minister had to step down. She did, and a temporary prime minister was appointed (from her own party, because they have a majority). So Yingluck (the PM) was out, but her party was still in control. So now the military, which has also sided with the oligarchy, has taken over and kicked the current government out. It's uncertain where they'll go from here, since Yingluck's party has overwhelmingly won every election almost since the current 1997 constitution was adopted. Thailand has technically been a constitutional monarchy (modeled after Great Britain) since 1932, but the government has alternated between military juntas and kinda-sorta democracy for most of the 20th century. To give you a sense of how much influence the military has had on government, in the past 80 years there have been 19 coups, 12 of which have been successful. That's almost one coup every 4 years. Since 1932 Thailand has has 17 separate constitutions. So you can see that it's not nearly as shocking to Thais for the military to force one government out of power and either rule themselves or install a new one. Now for the recent history. In 1997 a [new constitution]( URL_8 ) was drafted. It was widely hailed as the most democratic constitution in Thailand's history and the first elections under it were held in 2001. [Thaksin Shinawatra]( URL_0 ) and his [TRT]( URL_2 ) party won, and by merging with two other parties, achieved a majority. His government implements a host of programs, including universal healthcare, infrastructure investment, a war on drugs, and rural anti poverty schemes such as microcredit. These made him popular among the rural poor, and allowed him to gain a true democratic power base. This power allowed him to do basically whatever he wanted, so he did, appointing his friends, relatives, and political allies to positions of power, and [generally being corrupt.]( URL_0 #Criticism) The fact that he had this much power and was brazenly using it threatened many people in the oligarchy, who were afraid he would become too powerful and that they would lose their influence. Enter [Prem.]( URL_7 ) Prem was a general who became prime minister, then became head of the King's privy council, which effectively meant that unless the king said otherwise, Prem spoke with the king's authority. Prem was and is an extremely powerful man, and he was a major player behind the scenes in the [2005-2006 political crisis.]( URL_9 ), which then led to the [2006 coup.]( URL_4 ) So Thaksin was convicted of corruption, his TRT party was banned, and he chose to live in exile rather than return to Thailand and be arrested. The military ruled for a year, and then held elections in 2007. Unfortunately, many of the TRT members (those who were not banned from politics for 5 years) reformed under the [People's Power Party]( URL_5 ), which was widely understood to be Thaksin's party. It won the elections overwhelmingly. All of the people who hated Thaksin were furious, since even though he'd been convicted of corruption and forced into exile, he was essentially still in power, if only by proxy. There were protests against his party winning. After the leader of the party, [Samak Sundaravej]( URL_3 ) was thrown out by the judiciary, Thaksin's brother-in-law, [Somchai Wongsawat]( URL_1 ) became head of the PPP. Then the courts convicted him of corruption, threw him out, and dissolved the party. The opposition leader, [Abhisit Vejjajiva]( URL_10 ) became Prime Minister after he was able to build a coalition from the remaining parties that had not been banned. Now all of Thaksin's supporters were protesting because a government that did not win a majority in the elections was in power. Eventually, Abhisit had to call new elections, which were promptly won by a new party, [Pheu Thai Party.]( URL_6 ) However, this party was headed by Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister, making it even more blatantly obvious that it was a proxy party for Thaksin. And, following a familiar pattern, in 2014 the courts found Yingluck guilty of nepotism, and had her removed."}]}
{"id": "70ziof", "input": "why does repetitive hand movement such as typing cause damage, while repetitive use of other muscles makes them stronger?", "output": [{"answer": "There are differences between building up strength, and hurting yourself that go beyond repetitive movements. Running, jumping, walking, are all natural movements and our bodies are evolved to do these things without trying very hard. Contorting your hand to play an F chord on a guitar on the other hand is a very un-natural position to hold your hand in. It puts most of the strain on your ligaments, tendons, and finger joints, and very little on the muscles of your arm. So working your body in that position doesn't really strengthen muscle, but does put a lot of strain on the hand. The wrist and hands are mostly bone and connective tissue, where most of the muscle is in the arm. With carpal tunnel it's not the muscles that get hurt, it's the connective tissue that connects muscle to bone that get injured. This tissue is slow to heal and painful when inflamed. Muscles and bones for comparison have more blood flow and are much quicker to repair damage. The range of motion also matters. Typing type injuries are made worse by contorting the hands and wrists into positions that are not natural. When you hold your hands out in front of you at rest, they are usually sideways like holding can of soda. Turning them flat, bringing them in and rotating the wrist to make the fingers line up to a keyboard, puts strain on the wrists, fingers, and hands. Lifting the arms up to float over a keyboard puts strain on the shoulders, neck, and back."}]}

For the next, the follicle just lets the hair already there chill out. Then the follicle will let the existing hair fall out and remain hairless for a while and repeat. How long each of those cycles lasts is controlled by a few different hormones, which is why hair density, length and color will change based on where you are in your own life as hormone levels change. Follicles in different areas of the body react differently to different levels of hormones. So hair on your arm spends very little of its life in the Grow New Hair portion of the cycle, and hair on your head is almost always in the GNH portion. TL;DR Your hair just knows to grow for a certain amount of time, then chill out for a while and fall off. It has no clue how long it or its buddies are."}]}

{"id": "389slp", "input": "If you are still conscious for several seconds after being decapitated, what would be happening physiologically? Would you instinctively breathe even though you wouldn't need to?", "output": [{"answer": "I was super interested in this a while back and did some research. Obviously we can't study this kind of thing humanely, but there is anecdotal evidence of some consciousness (pretty much always the head the head just sort of looks around in shock/fear) from the guillotine and one story I remember reading about an Iraq (Afghanistan?) veteran talking about a friend whose head was removed during an attack. The most interesting example was some guy (don't remember who it was, hopefully some other commenter will help me out here) who knew he was going to be executed and told the executioner he would try to say something when his head was off. He didn't, but the executioner called his name several times and the head did look at the man each time. Also, if I remember correctly, it takes 4-7 seconds to go unconscious due to cutting off the blood supply if you are hanged without breaking your neck (also unsure about this statistic, sorry for all these parentheses but like I said I was interested in this a while ago and have forgotten a lot). I believe that 4 seconds also comes up in rats who are decapitated. I made that (very unscientific) connection on my own, but it seems logical that your brain needs a few seconds without blood supply before it entirely powers down and 4 seconds is the number that seems to come up the most. If you think about it, it doesn't really make sense that you would die literally INSTANTLY, since nothing has actually happened to your brain and it is likely going to die due to blood loss. Anyway, the little evidence I found seems to point to the fact that the brain is still working, but you're probably in too deep a state of shock and the time frame too small for you to actually do or think of anything (other than maybe pure shock/fear) as demonstrated by the fact that shocked or painful looks are the only things that come up in even the most fantastic of stories and by the one guy who actually did try and fail to do something more. As far as things like heartbeat and breathing, those are involuntary and still happen in a state of shock, so I imagine your brain is still sending those signals to the neck, though obviously no one is listening."}]}

You read, enough to where you comprehend, not over-doing it, spurring a wild day dream instead. 2. You recover, by writing a note or anything that pertains to further comprehension. 3.

{"id": "5v3xpz", "input": "If I bake a cake today with milk that'll expire tomorrow, will my cake also expire tomorrow or has the expiration been nullified?", "output": [{"answer": "There are a few different dates that get put on food, and they have different meanings. **Sell by** - mostly meaningless to consumers. A note for the store to discard the food after this date, but it's often a week or more before the food goes bad. Ignore this date, or add a week to it. Your milk probably has this date on it. **Best before** - a note for the customer. Quality can't be 100% guaranteed after this date, so you can't sue if it's not up to par, but it's still edible. **Use by** - this is a real one, but it only means quality may degrade after this date. If it smells okay, it's likely still safe. However, all of the above applies to ***unopened*** food. Once you open it, you introduce bacteria and humidity, and if you don't store it properly the date on the package doesn't matter. There are different ways food goes \"bad\" once it's opened: - **Stale/dry:** The flavor or texture is changed by the air. It doesn't taste the best, but it's not bad for you. - **Rancid:** Oils go bad. Some oils are prone to going bad from oxygen, heat, and light. Not only do they taste and smell bad, but they can chemically harm your body. - **Contaminated:** Bacteria grow when there's water or moisture. The bacteria can make you sick, and many bacteria (like botulism) make toxic wastes. Cooking it well kills the bacteria, but cooking won't get rid of the toxins. - **Moldy:** Fungus grows when there's moisture. If you see fuzzy mold or weird colors *anywhere* on the food, it's everywhere in the food. Throw it out. Now, back to the milk. The date on the carton is likely the \"sell by\" date, not an expiration date. Once it's home, add a week to get a better expiry date. Regardless of the date, if you haven't opened it yet, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. If you opened it in the past week and kept it in the fridge, it's probably fine to drink or cook with. It's been in the fridge open for more than a week... bacteria may have gotten in. Pour a bit into a cup and give it a smell. Your nose is good at detecting when something is off. **If it smells ok, it's probably good to cook with.** Cooking will kill off any bacteria and reset the expiration date. Cooking will likely fix stale or dry food too. You can put stale tortilla chips in the oven and they'll be good as new. You can cook with milk beyond its date if it smells fine. **If it looks or smells weird or gross, don't cook with it.** Cooking can kill bacteria, but it can't get rid of the toxic wastes from the bacteria or fungus, and it can't fix any rancid oils. However, you should know that if you're immune system is suppressed (old, very young, pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable to infection) then you should definitely keep to the printed \"use by\" dates and don't eat things after a few hours at room temperature or a few days in the fridge. This stuff may be lightly contaminated but still safe for most people, but it may be dangerous if your immune system can't handle the extra bacteria. You can still cook with it if you cook it thoroughly, but just be cautious."}]}

{"id": "3l39o6", "input": "We all know light travels 186,282 miles per second. But HOW does it travel. What provides its thrust to that speed? And why does it travel instead of just sitting there at its source?", "output": [{"answer": "Since Op asked specifically about why light move at all, so the thing is light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. Basically a charge at rest induces electric field and charge at uniform motions induces magnetic field and last but not the least charge in accelerated motion induces electro-magnetic field which is what electromagnetic waves are. Light only occupies a tiny spectrum of electromagnetic spectrum with radio, xray , microwave, infrared, uv , gamma etc being others. The thing is rate of change of electric field with respect to time (time derivative) induces a magnetic field which varies with space(space derivative). So you have lets say an electric field changing in time this creates a magnetic field which varies with space and since it varies with space it moves in space rather in time and then this space varying magnetic field induces a time varying electric field and so on the process continues. Hence a source(charge) sitting at one place can have electromagnetic wave(radiation) emitted from it. For eg antenna, the antenna in your phone or to understand imagine a walkie talkie with its antenna protruding out of it has electrons (charge) moving back and forth in it which creates above described phenomenon of changing electric and magnetic field and thus the wave from it can be received by receiving antenna which starts to make charges on receiving antenna go crazy and move back and forth which is what current is (motion of charges is current) and then everything works. Notice that in vaccum , no energy is lost so em wave(light) can go on infinitely until there is some stuff to absorb it . And since we have atmosphere and a hell lot of things which absorb it the signal gets weaken and we need repeater and shit. Hope this clears something. **TL;dr:** wiggling of charge creates em wave(light) which travels effortlessly in vaccum (why is explained by some maths thanks to maxwell and others) but not so easily in presence of other stuff.Thats why you see light from galaxy billions of light year away because nothing absorbed it."}]}

This is a problem with direct copying of just about anything and why [masters are created]( URL_0 ). The master ensure that all copies are from the same \"generation,\" each generation (copy of a copy) will drift slightly further away from the original and therefore be noticeably degraded). **Really ELI5** Its the same idea as trying to cut 10 sheets of paper to the exact same shape. If you cut the first sheet with a template, and then use the first sheet as the template to cut the second, and use the second sheet to cut the third, by the 10th sheet, the shape you cut out will be noticeably different from the template. Each time you will have some tiny differences, but as you get further and further away from the original, those differences add up. A lot of digital copying schemes work with error correction such that the data is not unidirectional; as the file is being copied, the duplicate is checked against the original for discrepancies. Anything errors are thus caught and eliminated. Thus you can copy a digital file an infinite number of times without a loss of data (assuming no compression and error correction algorithms).

Farms in non-arid parts of the world do not change the level of the water table, and pose no environmental or water hazard. A cow raised outside Seattle can drink and drink and not make a lick of difference because there's just so much water that feed rather than water becomes the limiting agent on raising them there. If you're concerned about California's water situation and think farmers are to blame, go ahead and boycott beef grown in southern states. That's probably an ecologically sound move.

That's not an exaggeration :-p And we help train their military, we help quell people who threaten them, we help support them, etc. Pakistan is free to complain and to refuse cooperation with the US. But doing so would wreck hell on their economy (thus their military) and everything else. It's much more beneficial for the folks in charge to just accept drone strikes and airspace incursions and whatnot. -------------- The US and Canada don't -- as far as I know -- have any such problems. Because we cooperate. We don't cooperate because the current 538 federally elected officials feel good. We cooperate because it is in our interest to do so. Pakistan's government is free to do whatever it wants. But when it gets billions of dollars a year and support from someone then they aren't likely to make a fuss about it."}]}

{"id": "3g017z", "input": "Why is Australia so heavily invested in the MH370 search?", "output": [{"answer": "Australia is a signatory of the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13, \"Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation\". Annex 13 specifies who is responsible for instituting and conducting an investigation. The \"State of Occurrence\" has the first priority; if the accident is outside the territory of any state, than the \"State of Registry\" shall lead the investigation, and states nearest the scene shall provide assistance. In this case, it was believed that Australia was likely to be the nearest state, so Australia stepped up to offer resources. Malaysia is the State of Registry, so they nominally own the investigation. Malaysia set up a \"Joint Investigation Team\" which includes several countries with interest. China generally doesn't have any jurisdiction in the investigation, but there were 152 Chinese citizens on board, so they've taken an interest. In each case (Australia, Malaysia, China), there are, of course, political motivations as well. Australia may want to show itself as a regional power and all-around good guy, taking care of its 6 missing citizens. Malaysia has limited resources to invest in a global investigation and limited expertise in aviation or salvage, so they need to appear to be bringing in all available outside resources (and if it ends up being terrorism, they will need to show they're serious about security). China wants to assert its global power, and appease angry Chinese families."}]}

{"id": "6rb518", "input": "Why does getting your own place and leaving your parent's home such a big goal for Americans even though it could set them back financially.", "output": [{"answer": "Most cultures have \"coming of age\" rituals, whether they realize it or even recognize what they are. For Americans, getting a car is one, as well as moving out on your own. A lot of this is stemmed from the fact that we value independence and self motivation so much. Staying with your parents implies that you are being lazy, or continuing to be a burden on them. It's similar to people judging someone who is letting their children breastfeed at six-years-old. By staying with your parents, who don't need your help and are often eager to get you out of the house, you are \"delaying\" maturity. Personally, I think this stems from a couple of different things. Historically, Americans had their children young, and had a lot of them. My grandmother never went past the 4th grade and had three children by the time she was eighteen. While she was married, my grandfather was in construction and would use that as an excuse to leave them months at a time, drinking all of the money he earned and never giving her any. So she stayed with her parents. This was considered shameful. While she was working in a shirt factory, my great-grandfather was the main means of support for them, even though he was older and had health issues. She was a burden on them. In Asian cultures, there is a big emphasis on staying with your parents and getting a good job so you can send them money in their old age. But in the last fifty years or so, American culture has gotten accustomed to the idea that parents are wealthy enough to take care of themselves, so your filial duty to your parents is more akin to making sure you visit them. But even then, when the economy has required most people to move for their jobs, it's commonplace that children live states away, which compared to Europe, is like having all of your children live several countries away from you. Now, we have a conundrum. Young adults struggle to find non-service jobs, and when they do, they are still struggling to support themselves on one income, leading them to stay with their parents. While they are belittled for this, within a decade or so, that same generation will have little to nothing saved up for retirement. With medical expenses looming, they are starting to demand that children who don't live with them to come back and help them. Once upon a time, our society was capable of the older generation sustaining themselves while the younger generation did the same in the same immediate area. This led to a lot of our current perceptions. But now, good work is scarcer, causing people who stay in their hometown to have jobs that barely keep them floating above water, or moving and not being able to care for the family that once wanted to kick them out."}]}

This would be a rare set of coincidences. 5) Since a lot of the weapons would end up reforged (i.e., boiled down), only some fraction of them would see combat again as the weapons that were in that particular battle.

{"id": "1q8vee", "input": "What do you listen for in an album if it is said to be well produced?", "output": [{"answer": "Well, it's ELI5, so let's start by asking a very simple question. What do you imagine the actual, procedural, making-the-record *difference* would be between a $500 debut album produced in a bedroom, and a $200,000, label-financed *third* album produced professionally? Nothing subjective, no talk of sounds just yet - what would be different between those two processes? Without even going into detail, you'd assume every step in the process would be *much* more refined, from the quality of the recording space, to the equipment and instrument configuration options - having more than one, for instance - to the recording equipment, to the amount of time dedicated to recording every basic (main instrument track) and overdub (secondary instrument or vocal layer added later), to the knowledge of the engineer, to the musicians available, and to the time dedicated to the project. And you'd be right. Not that a home-produced album can't be fantastic, and not to say a *word* about the *music* on the record - when it comes to producing a sound, lower-case p, there's a *lot* of expertise to be had in a lot of tiny areas throughout the process, and it's unlikely that someone without a budget has access to a significant amount of that expertise. A lot of folks making records on their own have *some* ability to Produce (capital p) and, more importantly for your question, *Engineer,* but it's amateur stuff learned by necessity. Some girl who has been playing guitar for a few years and has been mostly focusing on her playing and songwriting has almost certainly sorted out how to record that into a computer and lay it over a drum beat in a pirated copy of Pro Tools, but that's probably about as far as her knowledge goes. If you asked her how to re-record the exact same song again and make it sound much better, she'd probably stare at you blankly and ask if you meant for her to bring in an orchestra or something. She's not dumb, and I like the song we're imagining she wrote - it's just that you don't *know* how to do that unless you *do,* and it's not knowledge you randomly have, it's knowledge you seek out and attain and build on. Additionally, she only has one guitar, one or two guitar cables, her laptop and built-in sound card, a couple pedals, and an old amp she bought at a garage sale. Maybe she bought a mic at Radioshack for vocal stuff. Not that she has shitty taste, not anything like that - a great artist can make great art out of whatever materials they have on hand - but the artistry we're talking about now is *engineering sound*, and she's not a great engineer. So you're stuck with what you get - line buzz, distorted audio, probably low-fidelity recording. (And no mental skillset for analyzing *why* it sounds bad and fixing it in the recording phase, or in the mix afterward.) Meanwhile, for an album produced (lower-case p) in a studio with a team of professionals around her, right off the bat there are eight or fifteen guitars at their disposal - they're just in the studio, all the time, for recording purposes. God knows how many amps, and a whole *bunch* of instrument cables - all of which were bought by someone who knows instrument cable better than she does. And, most importantly, an engineer who really, seriously, knows what the fuck is *up* with sound. And specifically *which* combination of guitar, cable, amp, and mic will get her the exact sound she has in her head for the guitar track. (And then the engineer will do that again for drums, bass, vocals, and every other thing they lay down.) So here's where we're at now, having only asked ourselves a simple question, and gotten the simple answer. A poorly produced album was produced by someone who doesn't know what they're doing and probably only knows the one (wrong-ish) way to do *every* thing that needs doing on an album. A well produced album was not. Everything above permutates into each little aspect of \"the difference;\" in short, it boils down to attention to detail. Now, to specifically address your question, since you seem to be looking for criteria and thresholds, I'll start by saying that knowledge of any one little qualitative distinction can a dangerous thing in the wrong hands. At the least, it can lead to someone feeling unduly superior about their (inferior) knowledge of the subject - \"mmm, you see, the ends of lower-case letters in Arial are slanted, while the ends of lower-case letters in Helvetica are flat, ha-*HA!*, you savage, know you no fonts?!\" - and at the worst, it can stifle creativity, both on the part of you the critic and you the possible artist. So don't be all goin' around, taking what you learned in this thread, calling albums out for being poorly produced here or works of art there. That said, just think of the difference between the home album and the studio album above, and ask yourself if every little detail in what you're listening to sounds more like the home version or the studio one. From *recording* - does every instrument and vocal line come through clearly and unaffected by unwarranted distortion - to *engineering* - do tracks of similar-sounding instruments or vocal parts get muddied together and become hard to separate? - to *mixing* - does each track sound attractive and cohesive unto itself? - to *mastering* - is the album as a whole a consistent piece of work, quality-wise, even throughout variations in musical style or intent? Really, *really* isolate, consider, and speculate about everything you hear. Do you hear something you wish was better? And the fun part is, without being an engineer, our girl with the guitar *still* couldn't tell me how to make it better, and you probably can't either. But hey, now you've found the distinction you were looking for, a poorly-produced album. (Or so you imagine. Maybe there's a very specific artistic or technical reason for something to sound the way it does. Who knows.) In the spirit of wrapping this up with as honest an answer to your original question as possible, what do *I* listen for? Among other things, I listen for imaging. (\"image\"-ing). That is, the placement of sounds in the metaphorical \"3D space\" of the mix. Left/right (stereo recording, panning), front/back (reverb, clarity) up/down (pitch, volume). Keeping all of the sounds at work clear and distinct and not overlapping each other, while also being *near* enough to overlapping each other that I don't feel an undue sense of sparseness or wanting between them. Once all that imaging work is done with individual assets in the mix, what is done in the mastering process to the entire mix simultaneously is another thing to keep an ear out for, and this is when - among other things - you'd pick up the faux-\"wall of sound\" compression style that people on the internet love to talk about without really understanding, and other dynamic tricks. But, honestly? The more I learn about producing and engineering sounds, the *more* I find myself able to appreciate something. Especially weird choices, like, say, a distorted recording of a hand-me-down guitar and a crappy vocal mic. And it's great to find an artist like that, toss them some basic tips and an SM58, and watch them sort it out on their own."}]}

Considering its still standing and there's no visible blood I'm going to go with the former. The pain alone should have put that deer out of commission for, well, the rest of its life. Humans are specifically good at recovering from wounds. A wound that will kill a human will 99% of the time kill an animal. Most animals will bleed to death or get lethal infections from wounds that humans could recover from. And yeah, if an animal has its leg taken out of commission in any way it will starve to death before it recovers. This is why many animal fights seem ritualistic. The predators competing over territory will stare each other down until one backs off. The squirrels and birds will chase each other around and maybe nip a bit but never quite seem to catch each other. Its because unless an animal is already desperate, to engage in a direct full contact fight would be suicidally risky. There's also a social aspect to recovery. Even if an animal wants to help a member of its social group, most of what they can offer is comfort and a sort of \"preventative care\" in the form of grooming. Meanwhile even the most low-tech humans can still bring food and water, carry each other around, and provide medicine of a sort. Even bandages, faith healing and old wives tales is a pretty fantastic level of medical care for the animal world."}]}

{"id": "54isz3", "input": "How come some people can cry on demand, yet some people can't even after major trauma (Physical/Emotional)", "output": [{"answer": "Source: I work with people who work with people with PTSD. During stress, our brain tends to either choose flight, fight, or disengage. Flight and fight both create more adrenaline than is useful for our bodies during normal functioning, and that is why often if our bodies trigger a fight or flight response we will shake, or cry, or feel the need to be physical after - we need to physically work out the extra hormones from our bodies. With a disengage response, a mind disconnects from a body. This makes it not notice pain or emotions. This is known as shock if it comes on very powerfully. Usually it takes a couple hours or a good sleep for the mind to re-engage. During that time, you won't see much crying, because the emotions are just not there. Often, though, the crying will happen later, once the pain and emotions come back. We would always joke with my best friend growing up that he would cry about little splinters and cuts, but he broke his arm at my house once riding a toy car off the roof, and he just walked home after and calmly told his dad he had to go to the hospital. So that's the basics of how we deal with stress. Beyond just our immediate response to stress, however, our body can respond to trauma by becoming \"stuck\". Part of this is our brain being taken over by our most primordial and instinctive levels, but that's for another time. The other part is our nervous system. Usually our nervous system cycles between high and low (sympathetic and para-sympathetic). High cycles are when we are engaged, aware of details, and vigilant; it's how our whole body reacts during an intake of breath before action; this is what helps our body and mind make sudden, strong, and quick moves. The low cycles are when we are relaxing, slouching, exhaling; it's when we gain back energy, look around and become aware of our surroundings, let loose and ignore problems; this is what helps our body not always be a giant ball of stress. After trauma, our nervous system sometimes stops cycling. We get stuck on high or low. When we're stuck on high, we might not cry because we're just too vigilant, engaged, and constricted. Imagine a woman who's family was just eaten by a bear. She's out in the forest, trying to survive and find a way out. If she stops to cry, or even to rest, her body might just shut down and crash. If she stops being aware of every sound around her, she might also be eaten. So her body stays on overdrive to give her a chance at survival. Later, though, when she wants to cry at home, she can't because her body is still protecting itself from a bear. The other way our nervous system get stuck is on a low cycle. People like this just don't have the energy to cry, or sometimes even to notice their emotions. They can be withdrawn and will sometimes hardly even talk. TL;DR, it's our nervous system protecting us, but it messes us up."}]}

Since they are harmless and kill a lot of pesky bugs, I let it be and it would create a web almost every night around dusk (they usually deconstruct it in the morning). I watched this spider make her webs dozens of times. For people that are not spider friendly, let me tell you this was mesmerizing watching this spider. I would have friends that would come over and initially be disgusted then sit out on my deck and watch this spider make its web and just stare in awe then tell me how cool it was. Spider actually presumably passed away recently, as they only live about a year and their life cycle ends around this time. I miss it now. Haha. Anyway, she would literally very slowly just start coming down a strand she was creating and would just let the wind take it and she would just keep going until she got close enough to something. Sometimes she would just connect to my deck rail from the area of the rain gutters (6 feet) and sometimes she would go all the way down to the deck of the tenant below and connect there (20 feet). I saw she was actually pretty good at swinging the thing because when she got about a foot out from my deck rail, I saw her swing to it (north) despite the wind moving west to east. They must be very good at sensing weather, as I read that they are apparently smart enough to detect when thunderstorms are coming and they will deconstruct their web very quickly. I'm no spider expert, but I don't think they just send a sticky strand out like mentioned in the other comment. This first strand that the spider would create, was always a very thick durable but non sticky strand. I touched it myself once. Completely non sticky. Reminded me of fishing line. The orbweavers create two different strands, sticky and non sticky. The non sticky strands make up the most of support for the web (including the spokes of the web) and then they create the sticky parts as the actual web by connecting sticky web to each spoke. They use their legs to not step on the sticky web, transversing the web by only walking on the non sticky parts like the spokes of the web. Now as far as vertical connects like two trees, I would presume they would do the same, create a diagonal strand using the wind, and then would run another strand down this strand and climb up the tree higher and connect it at a higher point. I would watch my spider connect the first strand and then traverse back to her origin, and generate a new strand then climb down her first strand with the second strand in tow and then jump onto the deck rail and walk it over to a 3rd point in the opposite direction. These original 3 points were usually the only 3 points that would touch something. She would make more strands to support the web but would just connect them to the original two strands close to the mounting point of the original two strands. Edit: oh and despite the fact that the orbweavers take their web down almost everyday, she would almost always leave at least one of those first few strands. So she wouldn't have to do the web swingy thing every night, she would just start from scratch with the original strand. As long as she has those two mounting points, she can just climb up and down it connecting more strands to a 3rd or sometimes 4th point. So I don't believe they duplicate this everyday."}]}

Pricing is a complicated subject with many different economical and psychological aspects. People buy an iPhone because they think it's the absolute best phone out there (I'm not saying this is true, but it is the perception of many Apple/Iphone users). So they are willing to pay more an iPhone, more than they would pay for a technically identical phone made by any other company. This is known as \"paying for the brand\", and Apple uses it enthusiastically. However, not every iPhone user wants or needs an absolute top-of-the-line phone. They want the pretty design, but the specs are less important. So Apple gives them the option buy a slightly less powerful iPhone with the same design for a lower price. Other people just always want to have the best of the best. These are the gadget freaks. They will never buy the 16GB version, for the simple reason there exists a 32GB version. These are the people are willing to pay top dollar for their phones as long as they get the best available. So Apple charges them a lot more than the actual extra cost of the extra storage. The TL;DR is, somewhat tautological, that top-tier iPhones are much more expensive then second-tier iPhones, because people who buy top-tier iPhones are willing to pay that much more money. Here's a [blog post by Joel Spolsky]( URL_0 ) explaining some of the considerations that go into pricing a product. It's about software, mostly, but it applies to nearly anything. The software example just goes to show that actual manufacturing cost is all but irrelevant."}]}

How are SCOTUS rulings meant to be enforced in the event they are ignored or defied?", "output": [{"answer": "It depends on the nature of the law and the type of ruling. The SCOTUS itself does not usually have very much direct enforcement power over the states. To understand this question, you first have to understand the division of power in US government. - **The Legislative Branch** (House and Senate) write and pass the actual \"black letter\" laws, either with or without the President's consent (the president has limited veto power, which the congress can overturn with a 2/3 majority vote). - **The Executive Branch** (The President, his cabinet, staff, and downstream agents and officers, including the entire US military and most federal government agencies) actually \"execute\" or you might say, \"enforce\" the law. Hence, for example, the recent controversy when the Obama administration decided to stop enforcing certain aspects of drugs law in Medical Marijuana cases, or certain immigration cases: the representatives of the states pass the laws, the executive branch decides how to make them happen (or not). - **The Judicial Branch** (SCOTUS and Federal Circuit courts) *interpret* the law, where and when it requires interpretation. For example, let's say congress passes a law making it illegal to throw eggs at cars, under penalty of fines or prison-time. What if someone *kicks* an egg at a car? Does that count as \"throwing\"? What if someone was throwing eggs in the street or at pedestrians, and it hits a car? What if someone just dropped eggs off an overpass but didn't purposely throw them at anything? It is impossible to write laws that cover every possible variation or contingency, and the judicial branch is there to (hopefully) ensure consistent interpretation of the laws on a per-case basis. Another important role of the Judicial branch is to ensure the Constitutionality of specific laws, as they are applied. Neither Congress nor the President has the legal power to violate the Constitution, and citizens of the member states have the right to petition the federal courts if state law is violating their constitutional rights. In practice, what has happened is that lower and state courts, and/or, when necessary, the executive branch of the federal government or state governments have moved to enforce SCOTUS decisions that overturned state laws. What has not been rigorously tested in modern times, is a situation where SCOTUS issues a categorical ruling that nobody enforces. For example, SCOTUS might declare medical marijuana dispensaries illegal under federal law, but SCOTUS cannot directly order California police officers nor the FBI or National Guard to shut them down: it has to rely on the Executive Branch or state governments to enforce the law. What would happen if SCOTUS issued a direct ruling that nobody obeyed? That would be what is colloquially called a \"Constitutional Crisis\", similar to Congress passing a tax that the President ordered the IRS not to collect, or the President ordering the military to fight a war over the opposition of Congress... Nobody really knows what would happen. It could be civil war. Ideally, the next election would put more reasonable into office."}]}

{"id": "5q3iz2", "input": "What makes metal tarnish, and what is so special about gold that it doesn't tarnish", "output": [{"answer": "All chemical reactions are based on interactions between the electrons of atoms. To understand rust and tarnish, you need to understand how metals react. Rust and tarnish are generally made when a metal reacts with other compounds containing oxygen or sulfur in the surrounding environment (air/water/ground) and water. Other commenters have talked about how stable gold is, but the chemical reason behind this stability is due to gold's \"valence\" electrons; the outermost electrons in a gold atom. These electrons are the ones that are able to react. These electrons are found in regions around the atom called orbitals which can only take a certain amount of electrons before they fill up. What we see in gold (and other group 11 elements) is that the orbitals which contain the reactive electrons are actually at full capacity. Atoms like it a lot when these orbitals are filled and it ends up taking too much energy to add or remove an electron from a gold atom for a reaction to happen with oxygen or sulfur. This makes gold really resistant to oxidation (rusting/tarnishing). Iron, on the other hand, is very reactive with water/oxygen and forms rust (Iron Oxide) pretty quickly. It gets oxidized by oxygen really quickly because that reaction allows Iron's orbitals to be filled in a more stable way. It then forms the oxide after reacting with water giving us the red rust we see everywhere. Side note, there's actually a difference between tarnish and rust. Tarnish is a layer on top of the metal that insulates it and protects the deeper layers of the metal like the green tarnish on copper (statue of liberty) while rust generally flakes off and cannot protect the metal below (steel and iron rust). This is why iron things left out will eventually rust completely through while the statue of liberty is still standing. There are also quantum reasons for the increased stability of gold which explains why we see tarnish on silver but not gold, but that's a little beyond an ELI5. tl;dr: gold doesn't tarnish because it's happy where it is and it would take too much energy for it to rust or tarnish. P.S. looking up wikipedia's pages on rust, tarnish, oxidation states and electron filling of transition metals will explain everything a lot better than I can :) Edit^2: Iron oxide not aluminum."}]}

You buy some land to build it on. You fence the land in, build a bunch of kennels and let them share a big, common area for playing, drinking and eating. You have enough room for 40 dogs. Over time, this turns out to be a bad idea. Some dogs don't get on well with other dogs. Some dogs fight and bite each other and their owners complain. You don't know which dogs are going to fight with which other dogs. So, instead of having a single large fenced-in area, you built lots of smaller fenced-in areas. Each pen has a kennel, bowl, water and some space to move around. Each pen is much smaller than the big, open area you used to have, but now dogs can't fight with one another. Because each dog has their own water and space, you now only have enough room for 10 dogs. This is *sort of* how Chrome treats tabs. It fences them off from one another to prevent malicious pages from stealing information or attacking your computer. The problem is that each tab or pen has to duplicate all the stuff that *would* be shared if you only had a single, communal process, making the memory cost of each tab higher."}]}

He was the entire freaking RENAISSANCE of bullshit. Pretty much from the moment he learned to talk, he started making shit up. If you want an inside look at his life, read \"Bare-faced Messiah\" by Russell Miller. In the 1960s, Scientology was under heavy government scrutiny for their questionable activities. There was even at least one FBI raid at Scientology headquarters in LA in the old days. As it quickly became obvious to the government that Scientology was nothing more than a money-making scam, the IRS even revoked their religious status. But Hubbard just ignored that and continued to pay no taxes, running up staggering interest and penalties, all the while staging a HUGE string of lawsuits against the IRS, as well as engaging in their standard harassment, blackmailing, and other nefarious activities on IRS agents and administrators. Finally, after some 30 years of this, the IRS had been so beaten down (yeah. Stop and read that again: *the IRS had been cowed by harassment*) that David Miscavige was able to walk into IRS headquarters unannounced one day in the 90s, demand a meeting with the commissioner of the IRS...and get it. So the CoS and IRS met to hash out a solution both could live with. Remember that scene in Godfather 2? \"Here's my offer, Senator: nothing.\" Yeah, it was just like that. The IRS said, \"if we drop this, will you stop the harassment?\" Miscavige said, \"like a faucet turning off.\" And that was that. The IRS caved. But wait, it gets better. First off, by this time, as filthy rich as the CoS was, the interest and penalties they owed were MUCH higher. If the IRS had pushed forward, they could have ENDED Scientology. Wiped it off the map. But not only didn't they do that--CoS agreed to pay some chump change fine--but they let the CoS write the new rules about how the CoS's religious status would be viewed (short version: any new thing they pull out of their ass in the future is automatically religious). AND they got the IRS to agree to put pressure on foreign governments (like Germany) to restore its religious status. The IRS got...nothing, except the creepy Scientologists hanging around their homes vanished. So today, it's that locked-in religious status that protects them. Even though the religion part is all Xenu this and \"you're a reincarnated clam\" (seriously) that, they can go toe to toe with any \"real\" religion on goofiness. You think a couple of Mormon FBI agents who try and raid a Scientology office in Salt Lake City are gonna last two minutes arguing about \"bullshit religious beliefs?\" Other religions impose harsh conditions on their followers to \"spiritually cleanse them.\" The most devout followers of other religions perform extraordinary service for the church while living in poverty themselves. If you tried to take down Scientology as a religion, you're going to take pretty much every OTHER religion down with it. If the FBI raided Gold Base to \"free\" the poor sods eating garbage scraps in the RPF dungeons, every single one of them would indignantly report that they were there of their own free will. Actually, Miscavige's wife (who used to be the Goebbels to his Adolf) has not been seen in public since 2007, and there is speculation she's locked away in the RPF. There have been some noises about filing lawsuits on her behalf, but Scientology is SERIOUSLY abusive on anybody who tries to muscle in on their turf. These guys intimidated the freaking IRS enough for them to back down and apologize. You wanna fuck with them?"}]}
{"id": "6xzsiq", "input": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "output": [{"answer": "Sound is only heard when a compression wave in air enters your eardrum and oscillates it, causing the vibration of a chain of tiny bones to send the vibrations to your cochlea, further vibrating the fluid there, finally causing the movement of tiny hairs which our brain interprets as 'sound', with different hairs allowing the perception of different frequencies. One of the reasons young children can hear sounds adults cant, is that you lose some of these hairs over time as you get older and your hearing gets worse or damaged by listening to too loud music. Anything else which causes your eardrum to oscillate will be heard as 'sound'. Things which make compression waves that you can hear also tend to vibrate when you hit the solid mass that made the compression wave in the first place. When you click your teeth for example your creating a vibration which travels up to your eardrum , oscillating it and your brain interprets that as 'hearing' your teeth click, even though you quite rightly pointed out there was no sound wave. No, but there was a vibration, and you literally hear by making tiny bones vibrate, not by just sensing compression, or 'sound waves' but the vibration those 'sound waves' cause. Different mediums than air have different acoustic properties, water works very well for transmitting sounds, and over long distances, one of the reasons whales can talk to each other over kilometres. Rhino's also stomp the ground to send mini shockwaves through the solid earth to be felt/heard miles away too. Air is actually a bad transmitter for sound, but we have evolved to hear in this environment, and all we need to hear is the rustling of some branches to indicate the potential for a predator, and of course understand sounds as language which builds on our social capabilities."}]}

In the early days of 3D character rigging, riggers preferred the **\"T\"** because it was very easy to paint skin weights onto. Once model fidelity got to the point where people wanted to see better shoulder/elbow/knee deformation, a pose called the **\"A\"** pose became in vogue. This has the arms sloping downward and the elbows bent a little. A few riggers preferred a different pose called the **\"Y\" pose**, where your arms are up and elbows are very bent. And I've even worked with a few technical artists who preferred the **\"motorcycle pose\"** where you try to bend every joint in the body (which ends up with someone looking like they're riding a motorcycle.) But then came motion capture retargeting, and HIK. \"Motion capture retargeting\" is the wonderful world of capturing motion with one skeleton and then remapping it onto another skeleton.

Lawmakers in the Southern states enacted Black Codes, which outlined what rights black people didn't have (e.g. the right to bear witness against a white person) to keep them as oppressed as possible. That prompted Congress to write and ratify the 14th Amendment, including the Equal Protection Clause that stated every citizen (the 13th Amendment gave the Southern slaves citizenship) had the equal protection of the law. Creative interpretation of that clause led to the Supreme Court ruling (in the 1896 case *Plessy v. Ferguson*) that racially-segregated facilities were legal as long as they were \"Separate but equal.\" In theory, the States had to fund white and black colleges, for example, equally. In practice, black schools were terrible in every way. Every place of business had to decide whether they would serve white people or black people, with the latter always getting the short end of the stick. It was a way to keep black people in their own squalid ghettos, to remind them that Whitey was better than them in every way. Using the same facilities, like water fountains, would send the message that there was no difference between them and their utterly racist attitudes were hypocritical."}]}
{"id": "4oq81r", "input": "Why isn't sheet music just the letter notes versus the way that it is written", "output": [{"answer": "To explain, I'll first give the letter-note idea a try: For one thing, there's more than one of each note name. If you go to a piano and play the key on the far left, that's a note called 'A'. If you play every white piano key from left to right, the note names go: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,...and so on. So, with a note-names-only system, you'd have to specify which particular A you're wanting the person reading to play. This is already a thing, by the way. The 'octaves' the note names are in are numbered by their pitch from low to high. They're written A1, A2, etc. So if you're trying to write out the first line of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" using only note names, you'd get something like: G2 G2 D3 D3 E3 E3 D3 C3 C3 B3 B3 A3 A3 G2. We have another problem here. The D3 after the two E3s is supposed to last twice as long as the other notes. So we need to invent a system for informing the player to hold that note exactly twice as long. Another potential problem is, what if the player doesn't use a Roman alphabet? There are many great Russian, Asian and Arabic composers. How do I communicate with them? I'll stop here, but I could find a few more problems easily. The point is the letter-name system only works on a very limited and simple level. If you wanted to communicate anything more than a list of the notes played, you would have to start inventing more and more complex notations, which would eventually make the music as complicated to learn as the present system we already have. Written music is a picture of the sounds you're making. You can tell from looking at the score that there are places with high-pitched notes, or low-pitched notes. There are places where the notes are very long, or places with a run of very fast notes, and that's easy to see from the way the music appears on the page. Personally, I think it's beautiful. Think of it, how do you \"write\" a sound? More specifically, how can you tell a violinist to play this arpeggio at this exact speed, accenting the first note, slurring the last three notes, and bringing the volume and intensity down as the arpeggio progresses? Even harder, how do you tell a violinist to do that when the violinist lives on the other side of the planet from you, and was born three-hundred years in the future? Written music is a system which has evolved over hundreds of years and continues to evolve. (I'm currently rehearsing a score for a Broadway musical which has a few icons of eyeglasses in various places. The eyeglasses are a warning to pay particular attention to what's about to happen. You won't find the little 'eyeglasses' icon in Beethoven. It's a new thing and it works pretty good.) It's not a perfect system, but it works very, very well when you consider the complexity of what it's conveying. As a teacher, I get asked OP's question quite often. I blame the alphabet. The problem is, as a teacher, you have to get the student to play some notes, and you have to call the notes *something.* So you say, \"Play this, we'll call this note 'A.' Now play this, we'll call it 'B.'\" Pretty soon, the student has learned to play a bunch of notes and has memorized the names. The memorization part is easy because the student is already an expert at the alphabet. The hard part is getting the student to attach the sound he or she is making to the musical staff instead of the alphabet. Once the student has attached the letter 'A' to a physical motion on the instrument, it's incredibly hard to detach them from it. When, in fact, the letter-name of the sound you're making is the *least* important thing to know. The fact that OP has posted this question makes me think that he or she has gotten stuck in this trap. If so, you're not alone. I got 'unstuck' by two methods: 1. Take a piece of sheet music and read it while listening to a recording of it. Try to follow the notes with your finger as they play. This is a great way to understand the twists and turns a score throws at you; codas, repeats, and whatnot. Plus, you get to see what intense passages look like on the page, and what mellow passages look like. 2. I took the advice of a teacher who told me \"Read, read, read! Every day. Get a piece of music, read through it, and throw it away. Then get another.\" This is one of the best pieces of musical advice I've ever gotten. It really works. The 'separation' from letter names to 'just playing' occurs when you no longer notice the notes any more. For a non-musical example, when you look at a restaurant menu and see 'Cheeseburger,' you don't think \"Letter C, letter H--they combine to form a 'ch' sound--letter E,...etc.\" you just think \"cheeseburger\" and automatically understand not only how the word is spoken, but all of the meanings it conveys. This same, instant level of understanding *will* happen with music reading, if you read a lot of music, just as it took a lot of reading practice to understand 'cheeseburger.' Eventually, after enough practice, the little black dot on the staff will just be a sound that you make on your instrument. You won't give it any more thought than you do the 'ch' in 'cheeseburger.' Remembering its letter-name will be an extra step that has no bearing on the music. I'd write more, but now I'm hungry for a cheeseburger."}]}
{"id": "8ksgf3", "input": "If women were able to get rights in time periods as old as ancient Greece, why did it become so hard for them in more modern times such as when America was already established?", "output": [{"answer": "We need to understand the background. Most importantly, women were incapable of sustaining themselves financially. Pretty much all jobs required intense physical effort, which women are incapable of. Almost all the jobs women do today were nonexistent in the past. No healthcare, no state education, no services like hairdressers and manicure (except for the very limited aristocracy), no secretaries nor clerks, no machines to operate. Even traditionally female jobs like cooking and sewing were very limited in numbers because nobody could afford to outsource them (most clothes would be made in-house for the family, for example). As such, a woman needed somebody to support her. Thus marriage, which legally obligated a man to support a woman until death do them part. It was an exchange of female child-bearing abilities for male provider ability. A woman could remain independent and own property if she remained unmarried. It was possible for aristocrats who inherited fortunes or widows running successful businesses but otherwise nearly impossible. Sexual rights were a natural consequence of the above. In those times, sex meant pregnancy. There was just no way around it. As such, parents were making sure their daughters aren't going to get pregnant without a man to support her. Remember, women would marry within their teenage years, which means they were \"controlled\" by their parents for actually shorter time than currently. Also, young people are just dumb and easily abusable. We don't let them drink, drive, make serious financial decisions, own guns or make their own choices in almost anything. That was no different at the time of the past. Once married, they were obviously legally obligated to not cheat on their husbands. Lastly, voting rights. Nowadays the state has crept into our lives to totalitarian levels but in the past, people have much more freedom. Your vote, originally, would give you a little bit of control over three main aspects: taxes, the spending of those and foreign affairs (wars mostly). Now, women didn't (in general) make money nor paid taxes. Women did not fight in wars. In such case, why give them a vote over something that only affects men? Now, back to the original question: why would women gain votes in Athens and in the 20th century West? in both cases, women were capable of sustaining themselves financially. In Athens, because they could own slaves and in the West because they could work in the newly established light industries."}]}

But that means nothing unless you understand what the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI Model) is. In ELI5 terms, the OSI model is a standard conceptual model of the different functions involved in how computers communicate. There are 7 different layers. I won't go into detail about each, because that is not what you are asking about. I will give you a few bits though in order to answer your question. The lowest layer, Layer 1, is the physical layer. This refers to an actual physical medium, like copper or fiber, connecting systems. Single bits exist at this layer in the form of electrical pulses. The top layer, Layer 7, is the application layer. This refers to actual software / applications like web browsers. The most common type of DDOS attacks that you are probably familiar with would be at layer 3 or 4. Flooding a host with icmp / ping packets or http requests to overload it and limit the resources available for legitimate traffic. These attacks target specific functions of standard protocols that function as this layer. They are simply referred to as DDOS attacks. What makes a layer 7 DDOS attack different is that it is exploiting something in the actual application running on the server in question. In this case, it wasn't the TCP or HTTP protocol that was exploited but rather a function of the code running voat. This attack is referred to as a layer 7 attack for that reason, it targeted layer 7 instead of a lower level which has historically been a much more common problem for public web servers.

With that being said, I will give it my best shot. - ---------------------- We have three basic divisions of the financial industry. This theory on the financial industry I learned when getting both of my undergrads is not all encompassing, and obviously one could come up with other divisions that would equally describe the market. Neither description would be wrong and this will suffice. #**Financial institutions** These are (generally) the regulatory agencies that intervene in the market for various purposes. Examples include the SEC, the Federal reserve and so on. These (mostly) government institutions help regulate the market, provide various services (like issuing money), and pursue legal action against criminals. *example* The federal reserve may raise interest rates to stop or curtail inflation or it may increase reserve requirements for banks for a variety of reasons. ---------- #**Financial markets** These are the physical and virtual (ie: internet) meeting places where the various parties meet up to conduct business. In the same way you and I have a market to pick up our groceries or buy a car, markets in the financial industry are set up to reduce the cost of doing business and to allow for interested parties to conduct said business. *Example* A farmer wants to sell an options contract on the bushels of wheat he is growing for harvest. In order to meet with potential buyers, this farmer sells options contracts for a specified price on the Options market. He may do this at the Chicago Mercantile exchange, which was famous for exactly this kind of transaction. Without the Chicago Mercantile exchange it would be nearly impossible for prospective sellers and buyers of the options contracts to meet and conduct business. Another example may include a company looking to raise revenue for planned business expansion by listing shares in the company on a market (through a broker, which we will discuss below). Without being able to have buyers and sellers meet, this task is made nearly impossible, and the benefits to this transaction would not occur, namely the business would be much less likely to expand and at the same amount, and investors would have less avenues for wealth creation. ------------ #**Financial Brokers** This is a lot easier to explain. The brokers are the various clearing house associations and stock market intermediaries that facilitate these market transactions. To use the brief example I gave above about going to the store to buy groceries, if grocery stores *as a whole* are the market, then the Shop and Save company would be a broker in this analogy. ------------------- Now that we have a Very^very^very basic understanding of the background information needed to understand the financial industry, lets start answering your questions. Keep in mind, I answer these as someone with two 4 year degrees, one in Business, and the other in Economics, both with a focus on finance.  >  Do create anything? Simply, yes. Types of services offered include, but are not limited to the following: * Trading risk from risk averse to risk takers, like in our options contract example above * Allowing groups of people, like corporations, to raise funds, including but not limited to debt and equity issuance * Investment banks provide a wide array of services like business appraisal, Mergers and Acquisitions, and identifying market trends. * engineering complex financial instruments (usually a type of derivative) to meet some kind of goal EG: collateralized debt obligations Etc From an economic standpoint, one might distill it down to simply this saying, That the financial industry allows \"Net-Savers\" (used broadly) to lend funds to \"Net-spenders\" for a return, who then generally use the funds for some end. These transaction *generally* only occur when both parties benefit more than they lose out, and everyone is left better off.  >  Are they just playing with everybody's money No serious person who has studied the financial industry believes this. There are *real* socially beneficial services provided by this industry. Furthermore competition in finance is intense, and those companies and individuals that are not serious about providing value for stakeholders are ushered out or lose money quite fast.  >  I really have no idea Fear not, most people have no clue. In a similar fashion to medicine, or physics, Finance is a highly specialized field with professionals that often need bachelors degree or higher to break into entry level positions. There is industry specific jargon, lots of math (which the general population has issues with), and abstract concepts that take awhile to truly understand on the second level. It took me about a year of undergrad finance courses to really *truly* understand what the heck is going on in finance. I hope that helps, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if I have the knowledge, I will answer to the best of my abilities."}]}

Why are they doing this?", "output": [{"answer": "list of reasons Russia invaded Ukraine I. warm water port I1. this port historically belonged to USSR (russia) I1. russia wants to maintain their hegemony. even though people might think that their political power ended with the fall of the soviet union, this is far from the truth. Russia maintains their influence over its former satellite states by leveraging a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" power. I1A. soft power - large population of ethnic \"russians\" in former soviet republics. I1B. hard power- Russia has great mineral wealth, and all the pipelines and railroad lines are old soviet structures, which go through former satellites, such as Ukraine. these pipelines supply western europe, and feed russia ever increasing amounts of wealth (price of oil jumped from 20 bucks a barrel to over 200 since 1999). Russian businessmen also own most of the energy distribution companies outside their borders (niggas makin' bank fuck yeah). II. trouble in Ukraine II1. besides russias geopolitical ambitions and ways of justifying their aggressive stance, is the burgeoning trouble in Ukraine. The protests in Ukraine functioned to exacerbate a divide in the population which existed since WW2. The divide being between Eastern and Western Ukraine, the east being historically majority Russian speaking, and the west being historically ukrainian/polish. the borders forged by stalin and hitler and the west, and whoever the fuck was involved in ww2, are not necessarily drawn along ethnic lines. the whole area was carved up willy nilly, and that goes against the \"nation state ideal\" which is kind of what our whole political-social-identity westphalian system is based on (every nation {group of people} gets their own state {nation}). II2. now leading out of that point, requires mentioning that the protests in Ukraine, which began as political protests against russias economic dominion of Ukraine, took a sharply nationalistic turn (think tea party retards, or adolf hitlers nazi party). The radical right wing protestors took over, and people WERE saying things like \"ukraine for ukrainians, get the russians out of here\". now that is a whole separate discussion about crowd theory and sociology, which i really am way too hungry to get into right now, someone feed me please for the love of god i hate college. anyways, basically, the protests were some fascist ass occupy wall street bullshit, with no direction, which spiraled so far out of control that they toppled the government. Now obviously this would make about half (40% is half, fuck you, its close enough, suck my college balls) of ukraines population very very nervous, because of YUGOSLAVIA!!! Ultra-right wing nationalist idiots caused a genocide and made the country fracture into 7 independent, shitty ass, poor as fuck, useless states based on ethnic divisions and nationalism... retarded... but good for slobodan milosevic who probably stood to make a pretty penny if all went his way... once again, seperate discussion but this is all connected, I promise. III. satellites be leavin', like \"fuck you putin\" III1. but putin be like \"fuck you niggas, you my bitches, suck these excessively large and steely putin-balls. i be putin my balls in your mouth. etc... basically, the balkans, kazakhstan, and Ukraine, all have people in them that want stronger ties with the european union. whether or not this will be good long term are debatable, one side citing the increased cost of goods that will plunge even more of the country into abject poverty with the adoption of the euro... and the other side which believes in a long term economic solution hinging on middlemanning russias mineral resources to western europe (albeit with long term goals including the adoption of policy that will lower gap between rich and poor, think americas trust buster shit). I may have confused something in the last few sentences, but im so hungry and this is keeping me from lunch so i will assume what i mean can be inferred...motherfucker? yeah whatever. this is basically like the first section about russias hegemony, but more specific about the exact economic problems posed by being europes poor ass 2nd world bitches, or russias poor ass second world bitches. Either way, eastern europe sucks balls, but as long as theres no genocides then russia is probably doing good. to end this all of a few notes that may give evidence of biases and whatever. 1. i am russian, from ukraine, east ukraine. 2. the divides in ukraine exist, this is why my family came to the US 20 years ago. economic and social and political reasons. ukraine is poor, the people are divided, always there is a hated group, whether its people of jewish ancestry (me) or people who speak russian in western ukraine (also me), or just general flag waving nationalism, which is always bad, no matter what. 3. putin wrote his PHD on russias mineral wealth... that's how he leverages political control. think dune \"he that controls the spice controls the universe\". the \"spice\" being oil. this basically means that he can do whatever he wants short of a massive full scale invasion of europe, which he is not going to do, russia is more than big enough... 4. slobodan milosevic is the ex-president of Croatia, the main nationalistic aggressor in what used to be the nation of Yugoslavia. 5. regarding the protests against corruption, all governments are corrupt, especially america. 6. protesting like in Ukraine, would never happen here, because if it did, the cops would KILL THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF IT, and thats a good thing because people should be able to go do their shopping and shit without worrying about drunk populist assholes burning down the city. ok lunchtime, fuck this im dying."}]}

Other than bone marrow transplants (which have been performed for quite some time now), there really aren't all that many actual stem cell *therapies* that have been approved for clinical use anywhere in the world. The technology still in its infancy. [Very few usable therapeutic applications/uses have been definitively identified and perfected.]( URL_0 ) From that link:  > The list of diseases for which stem cell treatments have been shown to be beneficial is still very short. The best-defined and most extensively used stem cell treatment is hematopoietic (or blood) stem cell transplantation, for example, bone marrow transplantation, to treat certain blood and immune system disorders or to rebuild the blood system after treatments for some kinds of cancer.  > Some bone, skin and corneal (eye) injuries and diseases can be treated by grafting or implanting tissues, and the healing process relies on stem cells within this implanted tissue. These procedures are widely accepted as safe and effective by the medical community. All other applications of stem cells are yet to be proven in clinical trials and should be considered highly experimental."}]}
{"id": "246tih", "input": "Is falling in love an evolutionary advantage?", "output": [{"answer": "Think of love as a \"co-operation strategy\" between males and females where the alternative for both sexes would be to cheat for slightly different reasons, although it would only be an advantage if the other partner did not cheat as well. ----------------------------------------------------- Humans are mammals, and our sexual behavior is consistent with our Linnaean class. Donald Symons sums up the ethnographic record on sex differences in sexuality: \u201cAmong all peoples it is primarily men who court, woo, proposition, seduce, employ love charms and love magic, give gifts in exchange for sex, and use the services of prostitutes.\u201d32 Among Western peoples, studies have shown that men seek a greater number of sexual partners than women, are less picky in their choice of a short-term partner, and are far more likely to be customers for visual pornography.33 But the male of Homo sapiens differs from the male of most other mammals in a crucial way: men invest in their offspring rather than leaving all the investing to the female. Though deprived of organs that can siphon nutrients directly into his children, a man can help them indirectly by feeding, protecting, teaching, and nurturing them. The minimum investments of a man and a woman are still unequal, because a child can be born to a single mother whose husband has fled but not to a single father whose wife has fled. But the investment of the man is greater than zero, which means that women are also predicted to compete in the mate market, though they should compete over the males most likely to invest (and the males with the highest genetic quality) rather than the males most willing to mate. The genetic economics of sex also predicts that both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, though for partly different reasons. A philandering man can have additional offspring by impregnating women other than his wife. A philandering woman can have better offspring by conceiving a child by a man with better genes than her husband while having her husband around to help nurture the child. But when a wife gets the best of both worlds from her affair, the husband gets the worst of both worlds, because he is investing in another man's genes that have usurped the place of his own. We thus get the flip side of the evolution of fatherly feelings: the evolution of male sexual jealousy, designed to prevent his wife from having another man's child. {253} Women's jealousy is tilted more toward preventing the alienation of a man's affections, a sign of his willingness to invest in another woman's children at the expense of her own. ------------------------------------------------------------- Donald Symons has argued that we have genetic conflict to thank for the fact that we have feelings toward other people at all.88 Consciousness is a manifestation of the neural computations necessary to figure out how to get the rare and unpredictable things we need. We feel hunger, savor food, and have a palate for countless fascinating tastes because food was hard to get during most of our evolutionary history. We don't normally feel longing, delight, or fascination regarding oxygen, even though it is crucial for survival, because it was never hard to obtain. We just breathe. The same may be true of conflicts over kin, mates, and friends. I mentioned that if a couple were guaranteed to be faithful, to favor each other over their kin, and to die at the same time, their genetic interests would be identical, wrapped up in their common children. One can even imagine a species in which every couple was marooned on an island for life and their offspring dispersed at maturity, never to return. Since the genetic interests of the two mates are identical, one might at first think that evolution would endow them with a blissful perfection of sexual, romantic, and companionate love. But, Symons argues, nothing of the sort would happen. The relation between the mates would evolve to be like the relation among the cells of a single body, whose genetic interests are also identical. Heart cells and lung cells don't {268} have to fall in love to get along in perfect harmony. Likewise, the couples in this species would have sex only for the purpose of procreation (why waste energy?), and sex would bring no more pleasure than the rest of reproductive physiology such as the release of hormones or the formation of the gametes:  >  There would be no falling in love, because there would be no alternative mates to choose among, and falling in love would be a huge waste. You would literally love your mate as yourself, but that's the point: you don't really love yourself, except metaphorically; you are yourself. The two of you would be, as far as evolution is concerned, one flesh, and your relationship would be governed by mindless physiology.... You might feel pain if you observed your mate cut herself, but all the feelings we have about our mates that make a relationship so wonderful when it is working well (and so painful when it is not) would never evolve. Even if a species had them when they took up this way of life, they would be selected out as surely as the eyes of a cave-dwelling fish are selected out, because they would be all cost and no benefit. ----------------------------------------------- Source: [The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature - Chapter 14: The Many Roots of Our Suffering]( URL_0 )"}]}

He attended the 1963 March on Washington and saw the \"I have a dream\" speech in person. He endorsed Jesse Jackson for president, twice. BUT, a few weeks ago he was at an event with Martin O'Malley (the other guy in the democratic race) that was interrupted by BlackLivesMatter protesters. O'Malley, in response to the protesters and shouting, and probably in a clumsy attempt to agree, said \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter,\u201d which many took to be a very condescending and mistaken understanding of the whole point of that phrase. Sanders was ... also there? He tried to say something about economic inequality but none of it seemed satisfying to the protesters and he left the stage. So, a lot of uninformed people started to see him as an \"old white guy who doesn't get it\", despite him having a better record on this than literally anyone in the race. EDIT: Also, Bill Clinton has an excellent record regarding minority issues and was admirably called \"the first black president\". Of course that was long before Obama, at a time when most people thought we wouldn't get a real black president in our lifetimes. Still, the Clintons are very popular in that regard, and so Hillary has a lot of support from black people."}]}

Wouldn't it be in their better interest to stay open later?", "output": [{"answer": "In the US, banks have only recently (in the last couple of decades) become computerized at the branch level. Before that every transaction done was recorded in a ledger at that branch. This is why there would be fees and limitations on what you could do if you went to a branch that didn't 'hold' your account. They had no quick way of verifying funds. I never worked at a bank while they were run on paper so I don't know the details completely, but each day every teller must balance his or her drawer and without having a computer system doing the majority of the work it can be very tedious and time consuming, which is why banks used to close at 3pm. To give their staff a reasonable amount of time to balance and reconcile the day's transactions and go home. Nowadays every transaction is recorded electronically and sent to a central database. Making balancing nothing more than counting the cash in your drawer and comparing it to what the computer says you should have. Also, the Federal Reserve processes every single check and electronic transaction that goes through the bank even today. The routing number on your checks which looks like \" :|123456789:| \" tells the Fed what bank that check is from and where to send it to collect funds. You deposit a check from x bank to z bank, z bank then sends the check off to the Fed which then presents the check to bank x. So because the Fed isn't open on the weekends everything done over the weekend is posted for Monday's date, the next available business day. So essentially the reason for 'bankers hours' is a result of the history of the financial system and logistical restrictions. With that being said many large banks have been expanding their hours on weekdays and weekends. I think it is only a matter of time before we see banks start to utilize modern technology more and more allowing them to stay open for more hours a week.

The answer is that Sen. Cruz is most likely eligible, whereas Gov. Schwarzenegger is definitely not. First, Ted Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother. He obtained U.S. citizenship at birth through jus sanguinis (law of the blood). The other way to obtain U.S. citizenship is to be born in the United States (jus soli). Most children born in America are covered by both. To become President, the Constitution sets forth certain qualifications in article 2, section 1, clause 5:  >  No person except a **natural born Citizen**, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Now, the Constitution does not explain what a natural born citizen is, but we know that Ted Cruz was certainly born a citizen. Until a challenge is presented to the Supreme Court, we won't know for certain if Ted Cruz is eligible, but research is of the opinion that he almost certainly is. First, the [Harvard Law Review]( URL_0 ) published an article earlier this year arguing that at the time of the Constitution's writing, it would have been understood that a natural born citizen is anyone born an American. Earlier, Congress also posed this question to the [Congressional Research Service]( URL_1 ), which also came to the same conclusion after exhaustive research. Based on these, I doubt the Supreme Court would dare overturn the democratic will of the people given the lack of precedent that \"natural born citizen\" means something else. Governor Schwarzenegger was born in Austria to Austrian parents. He was not born with U.S. citizenship, and is therefore constitutionally ineligible to run for that office. Edit: typo."}]}

Tommy doesn't want all the neighborhood kids to come in since little Jenny and little Ricky are dopes who pick their noses, so he locks the door after he goes in. But, Tommy does want his friend to be able to get in. So, in order for his friends to get in, and because Tommy likes to play spies (that's a thing 5 year-olds do, right??) Tommy gives his friends two things: a codename, since all good spies have codenames, and a passphrase, just like they always seem to have in movies. For example, little Mikey is codename Condor and his passphrase is \"firetruck red is my favorite crayon\". Little Joey is codename Falcon and his passphrase is \"I like grilled cheese with the crusts cut off\". In order for Mikey or Joey to get in, they need to say both pieces of information out loud and then knock on the door. Tommy will validate the information they provide and either let them in or deny them entry. Now, along comes little Alexa, who's been wanting to get into the clubhouse for a while because she thinks Tommy is cool. So, she walks up and says \"Salamander, cats are better than dogs\". Tommy yells: \"You shall not pass!\" (because his dad made him watch Lord of the Rings and he thought it was super-awesome, because Tommy doesn't suck). Now, what does that little bitch Alexa do? Well, she gets ready to make another guess. But, what does she guess? Does she try a different codename? Does she try a different passphrase? Or does she try a different both? Because she doesn't know at that point which part was wrong, or if both were wrong, she can't make a reasonable decision. All she can do is randomly guess a new codename and passphrase, and figuring out a valid combination could take forever that way. But what if Tommy instead says \"Wrong passphrase\"? Well, now she knows (or can at least reasonably assume) that Salamander is a valid codename, she just needs to guess the passphrase now. She knows 50% more than she did when she started. It's all about security. People trying to get into a system they shouldn't be in try to get as much information as possible so they can cut down the number of possibilities they need to try. It makes an almost impossible task much easier if you tell then which part is wrong because you've just cut the guesses they have to make in half.

{"id": "1n2xqe", "input": "How do horoscopes and signs of the zodiac seem to work? Even though it seems unrealistic and fake, why does my personality match up very well to the description of my astrology sign?", "output": [{"answer": "As for your edit, there's a thing called \"confirmation bias\". You have 12 signs of the zodiac, each with a distinct personality archetype that goes with them, though personality descriptions can be vaguer or more precise, depending on the writer. There are hundreds of millions of people in the United States alone. The US census currently puts the estimate at 316 million people. Assuming that every astrology sign covers an equal number of people, that's about 26.3 million people per sign. Let's assume, also, that there are 1,000 different types of personality combinations that are noticeably distinct from each other. For example, someone who is extroverted, enjoys music, doesn't like the outdoors, etc etc etc. This would result in 26,300 people who all share the same zodiac sign and the same personality combination. Because of how zodiac signs were designed, they are **guaranteed** to match at least one personality combination, though are probably designed to cover as many combinations as possible. You are one of those 26,300 people. Now, you may be thinking, \"But what are the chances of my personality combination turning out to be the exact right one for my zodiac sign?\" This is the wrong way to think of the situation. Keep in mind that for this argument there are, guaranteed, 26,300 people in each zodiac sign that match the personality description. The most likely result isn't that the sign has some special significance to that it matches you so well. What's more likely is that your personality combination came about independently, and when you came across the zodiac signs, you decided that zodiacs must be special and meaningful because it describes you SO WELL! There are, however, other factors that also make zodiac signs seem more effective than they actually are. There are many people who, after they discover a zodiac sign matching them so well, start to obsess over that sign. And, whether they're doing it intentionally or not, they start to adjust their behavior to match that sign. Simple because \"I'm a Scorpio, and Scorpios act like X\". Another factor is that zodiacs may not be quite as spot-on as you think. The next time you're looking at a personality description, keep track of how many different points it's making. There are likely some points in there that don't *quite* match you, or don't match you at all, but you ignore those or \"round them up\" to true, because the rest of the description matches you *so well*. So, in the end, even though the description is only 70% accurate at best, or sometimes even 50% accurate, you mentally label the test as a \"success\", because you want to believe that this piece of paper is special and meaningful to you. Many many MANY people do the same thing in the last paragraph. Some do it to a greater extent than others. Some even ignore personality descriptions that are completely wrong, and only focus on the ones that are accurate. That is \"confirmation bias\". It's the same mindset that convinces gamblers that they were \"destined\" to win that last big hand, even though it's a statistical certainty that people will win gambling games many, many times every day. They ignore the times when their hunches are proven wrong, and only focus on when they're proven right."}]}

The first is the high-altitude EMP, which is caused by a weapon detonated many miles up (e.g. 30-200 miles above the surface of the Earth). This is caused by gamma radiation from the bomb ionizing a large portion of the upper atmosphere and causing it to radiate electrons back down to Earth. This the EMP that the people who claim EMP is a big scary effect worry about, because one bomb can hypothetically affect a huge area. The second is an EMP created by a surface or low-altitude burst, which is caused by the bomb ionizing (stripping electrons from) a region of air around the detonation point. This can be much much more intense than the high-altitude EMP but it has a very rapid fall-off in intensity. For a weapon the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, the damaging range of the EMP is not a whole lot larger than the other damaging effects of the bomb \u2014 if you are close enough for the EMP to be a problem, you have many other more pressing problems (e.g. being crushed or set on fire or irradiated). For much larger nuclear weapons (e.g. megaton range) the effects can go further, but are still on the order of being within the range of pretty intense blast effects (e.g. for a 1,000 kiloton bomb it extends about 8 miles, which is still within the range of the blast and thermal effects; by comparison, the Hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons). And as others have noted, the electronics of WWII were not of the sort that would be especially vulnerable to EMP anyway (vacuum tubes vs. modern chips). But separate from that the plane had made sure it was several miles away (slant range) from the bomb when it went off, so it would not have been affected by the EMP anyway."}]}

Similar to [how a computer uses binary to tell a computer how to run]( URL_0 ) (010100100111 etc) DNA uses four different nucleotides (ATCG) and depending on the order of these 3 billion nucleotides different instructions are given.

The best way to do this is to use the verticle ropes, as it makes it easier for you to center yourself.

TWO DAYS LATER the chips I put in the zip locked bags are STALE. 2 WEEKS later, the chips in the original bag are not stale.", "output": [{"answer": "There are at least two reasons. As other people have mentioned, zip-loc bags, made from cheap plastic (LDPE or whatever), are not impermeable to oxygen or water. Some will eventually get through. The inside foil lining of your chip bag is much, much better at keeping the outside air out. However, even though a zip-loc bag is comparatively terrible as a diffusion barrier, it is still pretty good. I'd have a hard time believing that a zip-loc bag would allow that much moisture in to render chips stale in two days. Which brings me to the second reason: There are a lot more chips in the chips bag than in the zip-loc bag. I'm guessing the zip-loc baggies don't contain many chips, because the bag can only stretch so wide, and chips are irregularly-shaped. So the air-to-chips ratio in the baggies is pretty high. Contrast that to the family-sized bag, which probably has a lot more chips, and only a bit more air. Why does this matter? It is possible, if the air is humid enough, and the air-to-chips ratio high enough, for your chips to go stale simply due to the moisture in the air already in the bag. The chips in the bag won't have this problem, as there are so many chips, each individual chip won't get a lot of moisture. As a bonus, most chip bags come filled with nitrogen, which is slightly heaver than air. Although it will eventually diffuse out, that initial, moisture-free nitrogen will linger for a while, giving your chip bag chips a nice advantage as well."}]}

{"id": "3m4oc0", "input": "What is it about the new marriage equality laws that people think violates their religious freedoms?", "output": [{"answer": "Nothing. Its a thin shield for their bigotry. There are three major ways the idea of anything else falls apart. 1 . There is no basis in scripture to prevent gay marriage. The bible actually calls for the execution of gays. But nobody's going to claim the gays still being alive violates their religion because they know how batshit that is. They just moved the goalpost. 2 . Religious freedom means *you* are free to practice *your* religion. This works for anybody. In any direction. The comedy answer is comparing it to a diet. \"To say my marriage is against your religion is like saying my cookies are against your diet.\" But I like this West Wing quote better.  > TOBY  > The truth is, I don't, sir. At least not a good one. I was intimidated by  > your Catholicism.  > BARTLET  > Really?  > TOBY  > Yeah.  > BARTLET  > It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me.  > ABBEY  > And me.  > BARTLET  > And her. Did you break any laws?  > TOBY  > No, sir.  > BARTLET  > Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov. Its *his* Catholicism. It affects how he acts and thinks. But not somebody else. You get to practice your faith, but you don't get to demand other people obey the requirements of your religion. Religion is a personal choice. 3 . Marriage is two different things. There's the religious thing, in the church, with the priest, the ring, and the pretty dresses, and the hilariously large cake. You know, all the Hollywood stuff. And then there's the thing the government does. That's a filing fee, a couple of witnesses and a couple of signatures. Romantic it ain't. Legal it is. Every time you read something about gay marriage rulings in the news, and all the court decisions. They are talking about option two. That's the one you have a Right to. Its a government service. People opposed to it try to talk like they are the same thing in an attempt to make the issue about religion, or the government forcing a religion to do something. Its not. Gay people have a right to walk into a government office and apply for a Marriage license. That church down the street being a religious institution still has the right to refuse to let them have their party with the cake and things there. Government employees have another problem. The government is forbidden from having a religious opinion. So someone acting on behalf of the government is also forbidden from having a religious opinion *while on duty*. The Davis court rulings made that really clear, Kim Davis is not entitled to First Amendment protections (Just like you may speak your mind, you may not be forced to speak things that you do not believe) for speech arising from her duties as County Clerk. Government Officers actually lose a bunch of rights while on duty, because people are given a lot more protections than the Government gets, and the Government is straight up not allowed to do some things. This is the only part where Religion meets Law and there is a direct conflict, because a Government job requires them to do things, and Government isn't allowed to do or not do something for religious reasons, so a religious person has to choose between their religion and their job if they conflict. But that brings it right back to the personal choice."}]}

{"id": "544rue", "input": "What does the term \"identity politics\" mean?", "output": [{"answer": "One of the purest examples I can think of is PoC children who are adopted by white people. I am adopted from Korea. Am I therefore allowed to call myself Asian American? On one hand, people assume I'm good at math, come to me with computer questions, call me \"chink,\" and harass me if I'm walking down the street with a white woman. On the other hand, I never knew the struggle of having parents who don't speak English, did not eat many Korean foods growing up, and reap many benefits of systemic white privilege. There are plenty of people on both sides who would say I'm allowed/not allowed to call myself Asian American, allowed/not allowed to chime in on issues facing the Asian community, allowed/not allowed to call for support from other Asian Americans. But it gets more complicated than that. If a prominent figure in the Asian American community says, \"Yes, adoptees deserve to have their voices heard about Asian American issues,\" what gives that figure the right to make that decision? If I were to start identifying as white (disclosure: I don't) because I felt my upbringing in a white family has more influence on me than my being born in Korea, looking Korean, and most people seeing me as Korean, am I identifying myself accurately? Once again, who's allowed to say that I am or that I'm not? If other Asians were to say that how I identify is up to me, does that validate me? Or if they were to say I'm in denial, does that invalidate me? And if white people were to accept me as white, does that validate me? Or if white people were to say that I'm biologically not white, therefore, I can't identify as such, does that invalidate me? Dave Chappelle did a great fucking job examining, discussing, and lampooning identity politics in his racial draft skit. And I'm being 100% serious when I say that the piece that captures the individual struggle the most accurately is Gonzo's character in *Muppets From Space*. Also see Theon from Game of Thrones, Abed in season 1 episode 3 of Community. I'm speaking largely of the identity politics of the individual because that's my firsthand experience and because the more macro identity politics tend to be muddled with social politics or regular political politics. But examples on a more macro scale would be things like WEB DuBois's idea of the double conscious--that is, black people in America must identify as both black and American, and often, those identities conflict. Or the idea of Pan-African or Pan-Asian identities. Pan-Africanism stems largely from the fact that when black people were brought to the US as slaves, they were stripped of their varied languages, customs, and cultures to be thrown into a melting pot of \"black.\" Pan-Asianism has its unique struggles because Korea, China, Thailand, Laos, etc. are all individual countries with unique histories, but should we exchange those unique things to yield more power as a unified Asian American community? When Farrakhan calls for action from the black male population at large or when Constance Wu calls for action from the Asian American population at large, these tend to be a combination of identity politics--they're directed at a group of people who share an identity and generally aim to address issues that face people within identity--mixed with social issues that aren't necessarily related to identity politics--for example, underrepresentation of Asians in Hollywood has more to do with how outsiders view us rather than how people within our identity view ourselves."}]}
{"id": "3ihix7", "input": "If i watch a 1080p video on my 720p phone, would it look \"better\" or the same as a 720p video on the same screen?", "output": [{"answer": "Let's make a distinction between \"is different\" and \"looks different\". A 1080p or 4k image on a 720p screen will BE different from a 720p image. By that I mean if we took every pixel and compared the color value of them while displaying the 1080p and the 720p, they would be different. This happens because a 720p screen can't display all the pixels from a 1080p image, so it resizes it into 720p. To figure out what colors to display for each pixel of the new image, it \"averages out\" the neighbour pixels of the big image. This process isn't perfect, you're taking several values and producing 1 value. There's loss of quality (comparing to the original 1080p). Now let's compare that to a native 720p photo. Let's imagine you took the exact same photo in 720p and 1080p. Your screen displays the 720p natively, but resizes the 1080p. In order to BE the same, the average-out process would need to produce the exact same 720p image (as in, every pixel having the same color value) as the original 720p photo. This can happen, but it's unlikely. It depends on too many factors (if the camera is the same, it also averaged-out when taking the 720p, for example). Now about LOOKING different. In my opinion, it can look better. The difference isn't usually that obvious, but 2 factors make it somewhat better to watch for example 4k on a 1080p screen. If you have a 1080p camera and take a 1080p photo, it has 1 sensor-thingy determine what color should be attributed to 1 pixel. But if you use a 4k camera to take a 1080p shot, or you take a 4k shot and resize it to 1080p, you have 4 pixels to figure out what the color for the new pixel should be. It should look closer to the natural thing. I have several 4k wallpapers that look better on my 1080p screen that 1080p wallpapers. The other factor is that it makes sense that cameras with higher resolutions will also have better overall quality. Although it's possible that a manufacturer produces a 20 megapixel camera and cuts corners on the aperture, for example. Or for example people who own and use 20 megapixel cameras are in general more knowledgeable about photography than people with 1080p cameras. This has nothing to do with the resizing or the screen, of course."}]}

We speak to children in higher voices because it emphasizes the phonemes (the sounds that each letter makes) and when you talk higher it is softer on their eardrums and allow them to properly listen to the phonemes and understand every letter in the word. If you've ever been talking to somebody and had them say something you don't know how to spell, you know what I'm talking about. Babies don't know how to read or write yet so they can't identify what letter is making what sound. Because of this, they have to hear the sounds separately and concisely. Say hello to yourself in a high pitched \"baby\" tone and then a low pitched tone. The higher pitch will emphasize the sounds of the word, allowing the baby to better understand what sounds are present in what is being said. This allows them to better be able to make connections between speech and surroundings as well as replicate the sounds they can identify. As for dogs, we see them as dependents and \"teach\" them the same way. Completely instinctive. (Qualifications: BS in behavioral psych with concentration in psych of language)"}]}

{"id": "1aar2b", "input": "How do we know that there is an infinite number of digits in pi? Is it possible that it's actually just a really big but finite number?", "output": [{"answer": "Well, the way you're thinking about this is muddled. Pi is not an \"infinite\" number; it's actually finite. You can perfectly describe pi in a finite amount of space, for example, as a computer program. Numbers can be thought of as falling in four categories: 1. Those can be described just as a finite list of digits + the location of the decimal point. 2. Repeating numbers like 0.123131313... We can describe these with: (a) a finite list of digits that doesn't repeat, (b) a finite list of digits that repeats, and (c) the location of the decimal point. 3. Non-repeating numbers whose digits can be calculated precisely using a finite computer program. Pi is one of these; you can write a computer program to tell what any digit of pi is. You will have to wait very long for a very late digit, though. 4. Numbers whose digits cannot be calculated. Now this is complicated stuff, like [Chaitin's constant]( URL_1 ). We'll ignore these. The numbers in (1) and (2) are both *rational*, and the numbers in (3) are *irrational*. So the question you need to be asking, really, is: how do we know that pi is in (3) and not in (2)? Well, this is actually rather complicated, and involves many parts. First, you need to understand the concept of rational and irrational numbers properly. I explained it above in terms of decimals, but those are not the true definitions. Rational = the number can be described as the ratio of two whole numbers, irrational = it cannot. Second, you need to understand the link between rational/irrational and repeating/nonrepeating. Basically, a number is rational if and only if it's in (1) or (2), and irrational if it's in (3). But I've just *told* you that, not *explained* it or much less *proven* it to you, and I'm not gonna. And even after this, proving that pi is irrational is not an easy proof. If you're interested in the topic, however, a simpler example is [the square root of 2]( URL_0 ), which can be proven irrational in a few short steps. **EDIT:** I'll just add one more point: **irrational numbers are just not an ELI5 topic**. They are fundamentally unintuitive. The easiest way I can think of explaining it is by talking about rectangles and diagonals: +-----+ |\\ | | \\ | | \\ | | \\ | | \\| +-----+ Think of the length of the longer sides vs. the diagonal. Intuitively we all understand that the diagonal is longer than the side. But now suppose I asked you to play a game like this: 1. Cut up the diagonal into a finite number of lines of **the same length**. You choose how many pieces, no limits on how many. But they must all be the exact same length! 2. Throw out some of the pieces\u2014however many you like. 3. Put the pieces you kept together into a straight line. No overlap allowed; the pieces can only be connected by the ends! 4. If the new line is the same length as one of the sides of the rectangle, you win $10,000. Well, the mind-blowing thing is that math shows that it is **impossible** to win the $10,000. No matter how finely you cut the diagonal, if the pieces truly are the same length and you don't overlap them, then when you put any number of them together they're always going to end up shorter or longer than the side. And that's what irrational numbers are about\u2014there is no *ratio* between the diagonal and the side (no way to cut the diagonal up into equal pieces that can match the side)."}]}

In basketball, this includes things such as rules of trading players, contracts, how revenue is distributed, maximum and minimum player salaries, the rules for the NBA draft, salary caps for teams, exceptions to the salary cap, and so forth. The NBA's last CBA was signed in June, 2005 and ended June 30th, 2011. Much like normal contract/salary negotiations, they are are centered around what you would naturally assume they would be centered on. The NBA (the commissioner David Stern and the 30 NBA owners) wants less costs, while the player's association wants higher/similar salaries. The NBA wants a hard salary cap (which means that teams are not allowed to go over a certain total that they spend on player salaries) at a lower level (so they spend less money, which means they can make more) while the player's associations wants to keep a soft cap (which means that teams have more exceptions, so players can make more). The focus of the lockout is about the BRI, or basketball related income. This determines the revenue sharing between the league and the players. It's a bit complicated, but they total amount of salaries and benefits given to players through agreed upon contracts can't go over the amount that they agreed to through the CBA revenue sharing agreement. If, for instance, it's set to 50% and the salaries and benefits of the players are worth a total of 51 million while the league makes 100 million, the 1 million for the players that would go over the set 50% would be given back to the league instead (there is a process where they hold a certain amount from paychecks, usually 8-10%, and then they check the BRI and payments at the end of the season). As for decertifying, it means that the players no longer accept that the union is their legitimate representative to the owners. The threat of decertifying would mean that in the event of a lockout, players could bring individual or class-actions lawsuits against the league for antitrust violation, that is, the NBA committed unfair business practices to create a monopoly. Just as a side note, but this has been done before in the Big 4 Sports, most recently in March of this year when the NFL player's association briefly decertified allowing Drew Brees, Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning to bring forward a class-action lawsuit (Brady, et al. v. National Football League, et al.). Edit: For those interested, USA Today obtained a copy of the last proposal (WARNING: PDF) put forward by the league. The players rejected it today.

{"id": "6xozjt", "input": "why is it bad to transplant a houseplant into a pot that's too big for it, but the same plants can grow in the wild with unlimited soil?", "output": [{"answer": "I have read through many of the replies but have not come across one that hit on a key element of your question. There are variables involved, relative to your question. Different types of plants require different care and will do best with specific mediums (soil mix). Some species of plants are water hogs (such as Spathiphyllum/Peace Lily) and some don\u2019t care how much water they receive (such as Sansevieria/Mother-in-laws Tongue). My Professor from the University of Illinois had said that each of us could grow plants on rocks as long as the conditions were correct. Meaning proper light, nutrients, temperature and air were at a level for the requirement of that particular plant. Thus it is very important to choose the correct potting mix for your plant. I used to be a Florist, Grower and Interiorscaper. In fact I was one of the pioneers to help develop the Interiorscape industry. The most challenging was putting live plants into malls, restaurants and office spaces and is probably the most relevant to your question. I was always battling those who would pour drinks (coffee and soda) into the plants like it was a sink drain. My way around this was to put a cone shaped piece of waxed cardboard around the plant and covered it with mulch material. Then when a person was pouring a drink into the pot it would run over the cone and down into the outer decorative container. This worked very well to help control the liquids that were entering the medium. As for container size, it generally does not matter to the plant as long as it is not over watered and moving to a very large pot, increase the likelihood that a homeowner would make the mistake of watering the plant. By continuing to water at the same frequency with a higher quantity of water (to compensate for the larger pot) would almost guarantee that the plant will develop wet feet. However, some species of plants will not flower or take-off (start to grow) until the roots have taken an abrupt turn in the medium such as growing out and making contact with inner sidewalls of the growing container. The main reason for using smaller containers within a growing operation (greenhouse) is cost per square foot. As a plant progresses to its salable size the plants are bumped up in pot sizes based on the determination of the Head Grower. Having plants in containers that are relative to their size also helps the grower to have much more control over the crop. They can easily vary moisture, adjust nutrient or micro-nutrients levels or if levels go too high, it is much easier to leach the medium when dealing with smaller pot sizes. When plants are placed into a home or interiorscape situation. The medium volume is important so that the plant is easiest to care for. Larger pots will help a plant grow larger as usually determined by what is called \u201cRoot-to-Shoot Ratio\u201d. I have found that bottom watering really helps in the Ineriorscape industry as plants are typically cared for and watered once per week in most cases. Bottom watering is a whole different subject as a micro climate is created within the growing medium. Many plants do very well with bottom watering but require a lot of work to set-up right The medium in the container is generally layered with different mixes to properly achieve this type of micro climate that the plant will adapt to. The setup works incredibly well for plants in low light areas and when plants are located in breezy places."}]}

{"id": "1ivwa9", "input": "How do we know whether or not global warming is a natural cycle - and how do we know which \"side\" has more objective scientists?", "output": [{"answer": "SCIENTIST HERE. Let me explain. We have been measuring how much energy the sun puts out for the last 45 years (with satellites). So we know how much the sun contributes to global warming. We also know how much greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Why? Because there is a law of physics known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law. If you plug the energy of the sun hitting Earth into that equation, and take into consideration the geometry of the Earth, you get an answer that says the temperature of Earth should be about 10 degrees Celsius or more colder than it actually is. So the greenhouse effect makes Earth at least 10 degrees warmer (that is a global average). Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be an iceball. That gives you an idea of how potent the greenhouse effect is. What drives the greenhouse effect? Well, most of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor in the atmosphere. The next most important molecule is carbon dioxide. Some global warming deniers point to the water vapor fact mentioned above as evidence that global warming is a natural cycle. There is a major problem with that: water vapor is a \"feedback\" not a \"forcing.\" What do I mean by that? If you were to \"force\" vast amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere, it would just turn into rain. That water vapor would not stick around for long. Why? Because water vapor rises in the atmosphere. It is cold in the upper atmosphere, and rain is generated when there is a) enough cold, and b) enough water vapor in the atmosphere. This is why we consider water vapor a \"feedback.\" It \"feeds\" upon the temperature of the planet. In other words, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled by how hot the atmosphere and oceans are. If they are hot, there is more water vapor. If they are cold, there is less water vapor. There is nothing we can do about that. Water vapor simply AMPLIFIES the greenhouse effect. So to explain the greenhouse effect, we are left looking at other molecules. Like I said earlier, CO2 is the next most IMPORTANT greenhouse gas on Earth (i.e. the next biggest contributor). There are more POTENT greenhouse gases, such as SF6 and methane, but they occur in trace amounts compared to CO2. CO2 makes up more than 400 parts per million (ppm) of the atmosphere. That means that for every million molecules in the atmosphere, 400 of them are CO2. That doesn't sound like much, but it has a large effect. You see, water vapor absorbs different wavelengths of light than CO2 does. CO2 \"fills in the gaps\" that water vapor leaves behind. This means that MUCH MORE sunlight and heat is trapped on Earth's surface, making Earth hotter on average. Many, many different climate models show that CO2 is the primary driver of climate change today. We know exactly how much CO2 levels have increased since satellites were invented. We know exactly how much the Sun's energy has fluctuated over that time period - it has not increased; if anything it has decreased slightly. In short, there is no other way to explain global warming since the beginning of the satellite era than by CO2 levels increasing. Scientists can look back farther in the past. We have instrumental records going back to the Industrial Revolution. Even though our instruments were not as sophisticated back then, they are enough to demonstrate that CO2 has been the major driver of climate change since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Looking back even farther, into ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland, we see a close relationship between CO2 and temperature. The same is true when we look back millions of years and even billions of years. CO2, more than any other factor, seems to be the major driver of climate change over Earth's history. Some other important factors include large scale volcanism and plate tectonics, but plate tectonics happens too slowly to matter over a 100 year timescale and there is no evidence that volcanic activity has increased over the last 100 years. Furthermore, explosive volcanism causes cooling in the short term: volcanic ash is injected into the atmosphere, and this ash reflects sunlight back. So this brings us back to the question: HOW do we know that mankind is responsible for CO2 increases since the Industrial Revolution. Well, there are many reasons. First, it is simply common sense. Combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, etc.) releases vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Furthermore, CO2 produced by human activity has a unique isotopic signature. Some climate change deniers say that volcanoes could be responsible for CO2 rise over the last century. This is patently false. Across the world, volcanoes put out one-tenthousandth the amount of CO2 as humans do. Volcanic CO2 has a different isotopic composition than CO2 from fossil fuels. All the evidence points to the fact that CO2 rise since the Industrial Revolution is due almost SOLELY to human activity. Finally, one issue that climate deniers frequently bring up is the issue of \"heat islands\" - that is, that some temperature stations are installed in urban areas that are warmer than their surroundings. This heat island effect is well-known by climate scientists, and is corrected for. The only rebuttal to this is to claim that the entire climate science community is part of a highly organized scam. If you know scientists personally, you know pulling something like that off is like herding cats. It just doesn't happen. On a final note, I will say that the satellite record of temperature change, sun activity and CO2 levels is outstandingly remarkable. That record alone demonstrates that global warming over the past ~40 years has been due ENTIRELY to human beings. If you extrapolate back, that statement appears to apply to the entire 20th century. Indeed, it seems to apply to human history dating back to the Industrial Revolution... and perhaps even further. In short, climate change deniers do not have evidence on their side. They are extremely dishonest, and most of them appear to be deniers because it gets them attention. If you pay attention to the news, the same dozen or so climate deniers are interviewed. That is how small the climate change denier community is among qualified experts. Sure, there are dentists who have signed petitions saying that they do not believe in human-caused global warming, BUT WHAT THE HELL DO DENTISTS KNOW ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING."}]}

The faster we perfect such near-Earth telepresence technology, the more quickly we will send humans to explore beyond \"near-Earth telespace\"...such as to Mars, Mercury, the Asteroid Belt, and Outer Solar System. (Eventually, except for tourism, *all* human activities in low Earth orbit, on the moon, or on captured asteroids, will be replaced by robots teleoperated from Earth-based consoles.) An asteroid placed in near-Earth space will enable us to develop such telerobotic technologies. Robots will mine water-ice from the asteroid, which can be used as rocket fuel. This will radically lower costs of maintaining satellites (they become obsolete once they run out of fuel used to maintain their orbits). Eventually we will store hydrogen and oxygen from water-ice mining in fuel depots, which we will use to boost satellites from low Earth orbit to much higher geosynchronous orbits, and, to fuel long-distance human missions throughout our solar system. By-products from water-ice mining are common metals such as iron and rare platinum group metals. Metals will be byproducts of the vastly more profitable mining of water-ice for fuel. Metal by-products though can still be used for robotic construction and 3D printing of massive satellite platforms, which are too expensive to launch from Earth. Eventually Earth-Mars cyclers, and at some point, vehicles which travel throughout our solar system and beyond, will be constructed robotically using such \"leftover\" common metals. Platinum group metals which are extremely useful but rare on Earth can be deorbited using crude aeroshells constructed in orbit, all at very low cost. Such platinum group \"leftovers\" from mining water-ice, will still be extremely useful on Earth. Strip mines, mountain top removal, sea bed mining and other ecological disasters will stop almost immediately. It will be more profitable to deorbit metals leftover from water-ice asteroid mining than it will be to mine such metals on Earth. (Basically the mines from which we obtain these rare metals on Earth now are remnants of asteroid impacts.) Although of course the \"price\" of platinum and other such metals will drop significantly, even if gold is as cheap as dirt it can still be deorbited as refuse at very little cost. Imagine entire chemical factories constructed of platinum, cars made of titanium, and houses wired with gold...it will take a long time for precious metals to become common industrial metals, but, it will happen. As Bill Gates says, \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.\" Unfortunately, there are also \"make-work\" motivations for sending *humans* to the asteroid after it has been robotically captured. Advocates of 'humans to asteroid' missions claim such endeavors will test life-support systems, which will be exposed to galactic radiation outside the shelter of Earth's magnetosphere. An alternative \"test\" of such life-support systems could be achieved through support of the Inspiration Mars mission to fly two persons around Mars in 2018 (similar to the Apollo 8 loop around the moon, as a precursor to landing). Of course we could learn much from sending humans anywhere, to do anything, even on an asteroid, but, an argument can be made that we should focus on developing telerobotic operations at the asteroid and test long-duration human factors by supporting the Inspiration Mars fly-by mission. Another supposed rationale for robotic asteroid capture is development of the ability to deflect asteroids from Earth collision. This is also misleading since the asteroid proposed to be captured is much smaller than anything which could threaten Earth, and, since the \"bag and drag\" system of retrieval is entirely different from techniques that would be used to deflect a much larger asteroid. In any case, even with the possibility a *robotic* asteroid retrieval program may morph into a 'humans to asteroid' mission, we will still learn a lot either way...

It was the first type to be invented, and the receiver needs fewer parts to make it work. In A.M., there is a lower frequency radio signal that carries the audio, and the strength of the signal is \"wiggled\" up and down to make the sound come out of the speaker. F.M. signals require a higher frequency, and more complicated parts to work. The frequency of the signal is \"wiggled\" a little higher and lower to make the sound come out of the speaker. When you turn on a light switch or have a noisy electrical motor, or during an electrical storm, there is a jolt of radio noise that interferes with nearby radios. The jolt interferes with the strength of the signal - which is why it is reproduced as a pop in the speaker of an A.M. radio, but is mostly silent in an F.M. radio which only follows the frequency change, not the amplitude (strength) change."}]}
{"id": "37n5s2", "input": "Why doesn't the body use up its fat reserves before it gets hungry and dizzy?", "output": [{"answer": "I'll answer from the physiological viewpoint here. Important Fact 1: In terms of energy sources, the brain uses glucose, and **only** glucose (we'll ignore Ketones since those only really play a role in prolonged starvation). Let's go into the energy counts of a normal 70kg male, the average person requires 2250kcal every day. * 15kg fat - Worth 141,000kcal * 6kg protein - Worth 24,000kcal * 225g of Glycogen - worth 900kcal * TWENTY grams of free glucose and fats - worth about 100kcal * Total energy content: ~170,000kcal You will notice that the amount of free glucose is bupkis compared to the requirement. For now, let's assume that there's no food intake (so we can see how fat is mobilized); this is known as the fasting state. The body's goal is simple: Keep blood glucose concentrations at about 3.9 to 5.8 mM/L. It accomplishes this through two methods, either convert glycogen to glucose (easy and fast, glycogen is essentially \"prepacked\" glucose), or convert fat to glucose (much slower and longer metabolic pathway, knocking fat down to build glucose again, a la chumbawamba). This is where we get to your question: The body does use fats before it gets hungry and dizzy, it just prefers glucose whenever possible. Is it pleasant to feel a bit hungry? Not really; Is it unhealthy to go hungry for a bit? No too. Have you ever heard of the \"second wind\" phenomenon in marathon runners? You know, that thing where they seem to have a fresh burst of energy after a long running race where you would expect them to get tired out? That's a phenomenon known as metabolic switching, in this case, it's the body finally having turned on the pathways needed to use fat as energy.. In prolonged starvation, the body can indeed utilize fats instead of glucose to supply the brain (via ketone bodies, but let's not go there), but the problem is that it takes up to 10 days for fats to be fully mobilized, in fact, at this point, appetite can often be suppressed (no, don't try this; yes, it can be harmful; no, you will not get acid superpowers; no, I will not be held liable; yes, I will be taking your stuff). So, TL;DR: The body DOES use up its fat reserves before it gets hungry and dizzy. Being hungry and dizzy is NOT always a sign of starvation. What makes you feel bad is not necessarily unhealthy. The reason the body doesn't always use fats immediately is that fats take a while to be mobilized."}]}

I am a manager for a $4 million a year store in a multi billion dollar company. My company pays 50 cents above minimum wage as a starting point. In Ontario Canada, recently our minimum wage went up to 11.25, therefore we pay 11.75. My wage budget for the year did not change with this increase in wage that all of my minimum wage workers received. If I am spending an extra $2 per standard closing shift, per employee, over the course of the year, the only thing I can do is not book as many people, or throw my wage out of whack. Essentially, your time as an employee for me is worth more, but as a result I will see you less, meaning over the course of a year, you will earn less. My expectations when I do see you is that you juggle more customers and/or tasks. Higher stress for the employee over their 4 hour shift for $2. Now the other problem is my full timers used to earn $2 plus an hour more then new kids because of there experience and skill set. That differential is eroded because those earning above minimum didn't see an equivalent increase. Up one more peg, my entry level managers make around $15 an hour on salary. If I increase wages for my full time floor staff, then I am showing them I value them above part timers, but I bring them dangerously close to my management team. If I increase full time and management wage 50 cents, which is 8 bodies, then that's $160 week more on wage. There goes another 4 shifts a week for part timers. The end result ends up being either 1) low skilled or low experienced employees making more while the rest of our tenured staff, management included continue on. 2) a wonderful trickle up effect where we all make more money. 3) I increase my valued employees wage to keep pace and shrink my roster down. Whatever anyone says about the ramifications, there are good and bad points for increasing. The bottom line is if 50 cents can throw of my wage for the couple months I have left of fiscal, you can be guaranteed that a jump up to $15 or anything like that will have drastic changes, if not to the requirements to receive the job, then to the expectations placed on individuals in that job.

{"id": "6h8cqd", "input": "How come low unemployment rates don't directly translate into higher wages?", "output": [{"answer": "Because wages are also a signaling mechanism. If you operate a business, you've got employees at all levels and you pay those employees enough to keep them happy enough that they don't leave. That means what you pay them is strongly related to their expectations. People expect to be paid around the industry standard for their profession. They expect to be paid in accordance to their years of service/experience. They expect to be paid based on their level in the company. They also expect to be paid more than they were in the past. If you violate these expectations, you'll end up with workers leaving - even if their pay is competitive in the market. So let's say you've got a line of widget wranglers. You pay all of them $10/hour. Unemployment drops and you simply can't find new widget wranglers to replace the ones who retire or drop out of the workforce at $10/hour. So you offer $12/hour to new hires. How do you think that makes your existing employees feel once they find out? Probably pretty angry. So before you can offer $12/hour to new widget wranglers, you've got to give all your *old* widget wranglers $12/hour. Which means giving a raise to all their supervisor so they're not being paid less than their subordinates - which means giving a raise to all *their* supervisors, etc. Now you've give a company-wide raise to everyone just so you can hire a few widget-wranglers. Suddenly a recession occurs. Now you've got a massive payroll you can't afford. But you can't simply cut wages - your employees would feel insulted and leave. So you're losing money hand over foot simply because you needed a very junior level of employee. The alternative? You could have simply not hired that extra widget wrangler at $12/hour and waited it out until you found someone willing to accept $10/hour. The latter strategy is almost always the more sensible one."}]}

The problem with street heroin is that a user does not know that they can get it at any time, or the quality of it. They will buy it when they can and get what they can. An unsteady supply makes it hard to ration and therefore hard to slowly cut back and quit, it also keeps the addicts mind on the task of acquiring the drug and makes them worry about their supply. (Source:  URL_0 ) I cant find a source for it at the moment, but if I remember correctly there are no more addicts now then there were before many drugs were made illegal. Addiction rates are generally the same in most societies during most times in history. Since its easier to kick the habit when your habit is more acceptable, and there is a good supply, people are less likely to be lifetime addicts when their drug is legal. Legalisation should not lower addiction rates, but it reduces the length of time people are addicts (and therefore harm). Legalisation is usually a strategy of harm reduction."}]}
{"id": "5ryqio", "input": "Is there anything in the Constitution that prevents the 3 branches of government, if a party has majority of all 3, from following partisan politics and bypassing all checks and balances?", "output": [{"answer": "There are some constitutional law theories that may allow it, but they haven't succeeded in practice. They stem from the fact that while the federal government has 3 branches, that's only half of the picture. The individual states have rights as well (although they can really only challenge the federal government if they act together). The first is called [nullification]( URL_1 ). This is a legal theory that each state has the right to nullify any federal law that the state believes is unconstitutional. This isn't explicitly laid out in the constitution, and has been rejected by both state and federal courts every time it's been tried. A similar option is called [interposition]( URL_0 ). This involves multiple states acting together to prevent the ability of the federal government to enforce laws considered unconstitutional. This would buy the states time to go through the process of challenging laws. It would also wait out the clock until the next election which could correct the issues (the members of the House of Representatives have two year term limits). Then there's an option that's never been used and is rarely discussed in Article V of the Constitution. Article V discusses how amendments to the constitution are proposed, and so far they have all used the first option - a two-thirds vote by both the House of Representative and the Senate (then ratification by the states). But there's a second option, often called an [Article V Convention]( URL_2 ) - If two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for a convention to propose amendments, the states could decide to directly change the Constitution *without any say from federal government*. The state governments would be able to restructure the government at will, as long as three-quarters of the states agreed on new amendments proposed. Changing the Constitution directly isn't something to do lightly, of course. An Article V Convention is really just a last resort in case the three branches of government unite to do something extreme, like amending the constitution themselves to make the president a dictator for life. But it's a good reminder that the federal government is only given power by the states, who are given power by the people of the states, which is noted in the very first line of the Constitution.

{"id": "4wqzu2", "input": "Why does air come up from underwater in bubbles instead of a constant flow of air", "output": [{"answer": "Most people are close, but not quite hitting the right explanation. The reason for bubble formation, not a column is indeed surface tension. Very simply. Surface tension is caused by unequal forces between dissimilar fluids. Similar fluids want to stick together - for example, hydrogen bonding in water means water wants to stick to itself much more than other fluids (causing relatively high surface tension in water vs. other substances), and van der Waals forces exist in all substances (causing oil to want to stick to itself more than other dissimilar fluids). If the fluids 'like' each other, for example water and ethanol, then there is no surface tension between them because they just mix! Whether fluids 'like' each other is another story, but even the same compound (liquid water and steam) can be dissimilar enough for them to have surface tension effects between them. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy is always increasing - that is, things are always wanting to release heat (energy) and move into a state where energy gradients don't exist e.g. a hot bowl of water will release heat until it is the same temperature as the bulk air around it. In the same way, having lots of surface area between two dissimilar fluids causes a high energy state, like high temperature. A big cylinder isn't the shape with the lowest surface area to volume ratio (i.e. has a good amount of surface tension), so the fluids will rearrange such that the smallest surface area, a sphere, is formed (thus reducing the surface tension, and energy of the bubble). In doing so, heat is released, but because liquids tend to have relatively high heat capacities, the temperature rise is negligible. Incidentally, this is also the reason why very little bubbles are not stable! Lots of little bubbles has a HUGE surface area. The high surface tension causes an extremely high internal pressure and the bubble collapses, often causing a very localised heat spot in the resulting implosion (and even light in some cases!). See  URL_0  for an example of sonoluminescence! Instead, the vapour pressure of the dissolved gases will cause the gas to come out of solution, and this will be as part of a larger bubble (where the increased surface area is small compared to the added volume of air), and that is why bubbles grow and grow - shake a bottle of oil and see. In a column of rising air in oil/water, you also have to consider gravity. In the absence of gravity, a perfect sphere would form out of the column of air. In gravity, the density difference between air and a liquid will cause the air bubble to rise and detach from another bubble below it before it can form a mega bubble. If you go a step further and pressurise the air, the surface tension effects and gravity effects become insignificant, and you get a jet of air erupting through the water.

The question is really why are we awake at all beyond what is required to eat and breed. Biology would prefer to have organisms sleep the maximum amount of time possible. When you are resting you are using less energy, not exposing yourself to predators, injury etc. If you look at sleep patterns across mammals you will notice that animals that can meet their needs in terms of feeding and breeding in a short time, and are relatively safe from predators while sleeping, like the cats, will sleep the majority of the day, because they have that as an option. Animals that have lower energy diets, have to travel long distances between meals or are vulnerable when sleeping in their environments will spend the majority of the day awake, like horses. But the cost of this is that their life is much less efficient. Humans fall somewhere in the middle in terms of hours awake needed in the day. Historically, we didn't get as many calories per meal as the large predators, but more than the grazers. So we feel the urge to be awake long enough to eat and devote a bit of time to breeding and raising a family, historically around 16 hours a day. In today's society, those tasks are so easy that humans have discovered a new phenomenon that is mostly absent from the life experience of other mammals. Leisure time awake. We have taken advantage of this extra time to do wonderful things and advance our society, but our biology is stuck with sleep being the preferred state to be in and only being awake for the 16 or so hours required to historically take care of our biological needs. Biologically, before modern society, it was a disadvantage to be awake and active more than absolutely necessary."}]}

Low end tq and consistently rising from a car that can rev high will give you your best results(this is el5, I know there's a lot of tweaking you can do). Horsepower is nothing more than an equation from a formula. There's no actual horsepower readout when testing a cars power, it measures torque, multiplied it by the rpm you are at, then divided by a constant(5252) you get HP. Written out(on mobile) like HP=[(TQ*RPM)/5252] Which, you can see here, and on any Hp readout graph, that your tq=hp at 5252rpms. There's much more to this, and I'd love to keep going, but I'm doing this from memory of stuff I was doing 10-15 years ago and I don't know how accurate I'll be. I know Some large trucks may have a very low(relative) hp rating, but because they only rev to 3k rpms, they may have over 1000 ft/lb of tq, yet in the 200-300hp range. Yet it can move a 20,000lb trailer, where your 500hp anything car would burn out trying to get that moving. Once again from hazy memory, so my numbers may be off, but the concept is there. Also, hp can be looked at as \"high end power\". (It's not the best way to describe it, because I feel it makes hp feel like a variable, instead of a readout based on your tq) the more low end tq you have, the better you can tow, and get up and moving. The more hp you have, the better you can accelerate when your in the upper part of your rpms. There's so much more, and as I remember little bits, I need to stop.

There's no evolution director saying \"Yeah, if your fur were green you would do better\" and then go and redesign the genome so that they could make green fur. Evolution is a slow process. The way that fur is colored makes it hard for that to happen. There's the same range of hair colors for pretty much everything, and its the range of whites to blacks, reds, oranges, yellows and browns, which are made by melanins or lack thereof. Evolution happens slowly. You'd need a completely new compound to make green fur. You'd have to take steps towards that. But the steps toward that wouldn't make your fur any greener, so it wouldn't improve your likelihood of passing the genes down. Think about something like a mallard. Mallards have green heads. But not because of green pigment. The pigments on feathers are the same pigments in hair and fur. But they have evolved to grow the small feathers on their head to be a specific shape that reflects green light. This is called a structural color. This is something you can do with a feather because of its structural strength, but you can't do with fur. Basically, you have skins that have living cells on them. Living cells have a lot of options for colors, even letting the organism change it's color. Skin can be a lot of colors because it's alive. Then you have something like feathers and insect scales, which are pretty rigid structures. They are colored by melanin pigments to be the normal brown, red, black, blonde, white colors. But they can also hold a rigid structure that refracts particular wavelengths of visible light. Then you have something like hair, which are non-living cells, and are flexible and soft, and grow differently than feathers. They can develop structural color, (I found a few examples) but it's rare. Then you have some examples of things like sloths with blue-green fur through a kind of symbiotic relationship with algae and properties of their fur. But basically, the more rigid structure of feathers and insect scales made it easier for them to develop structural colors. It's possible for them to exist in mammal fur, but is a big leap evolutionarily so it happens rarely. Fur works really well. Fur coloring works really well.

IMO the three most important / ELI5 differences between colleges are: Different student bodies. There is (should be?) a lot of peer learning in college. Who do you want to be around? What do you want your future network to look like? This isn't a linear spectrum either: things like racial, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity matter to the college experience just as much as having smart classmates. More resources. Students at \"lesser\" colleges will routinely need to spend an extra semester or two of time and tuition because their financial aid changed, they couldn't get into the classes they needed, they were advised poorly, or some other preventable situation. Students at \"better\" colleges are then given access to research labs, internships, travel abroad, and other things that put icing on a great education. Higher standards and academic reputation. Even with the same core content, standards really are not the same everywhere. People know this, and it feeds into the reputation."}]}

We didn't run any advertisements in our website, what we did was just ask people to donate for hosting, we only asked for the amount that we needed for hosting. We did this like every 6 months and in a few days we'd find somebody that'd pay our server bills. We did this because we didn't want to profit from it, not only for ethical reasons but also in the hopes that showing we didn't profit would give us some legal protection/leniency if we got caught. The vast majority of trackers and sites like that, however, were run for a profit. Thepiratebay was among those 100%-for-profit enterprises that turned a huge profit while portraying themselves as uninterested martyrs. The truth is that bandwidth is hilariously cheap if you don't have specific stability concerns for it. For a tracker, it's irrelevant to have an uptime of \"just\" 98% or a packet loss of 2% (too much for enterprise) or a latency that is 50ms higher than it should, but this kind of bandwidth is really, really cheap. I made calculations once and the piratebay could have been paid for by showing a single banner one day a month. But they had a shit-ton of banners all month long, all that was profit. The reason there was a conviction is that as soon as numbers were presented in court it became clear to everybody present that the pirate bay was a cynical cash-grab and not an ideologically-driven internet community. EDIT: Here is the verdict in English,  URL_0  in pages 53 and 58 you can read how the commercial nature of the operation was indeed a factor regarded in the severity of the penalties.  >  It has been confirmed that the operation of The Pirate Bay has generated advertising revenue which, during the period indicated in the indictment, has amounted to at least SEK 1,200,000. On this basis alone, the District Court can conclude that the operation was carried on as a commercial project. This conclusion is confirmed by the correspondence between the defendants and the fact that the defendants have investigated and discussed various corporate forms which may have been applicable to the continued operation of The Pirate Bay. It has, consequently, been a question of an operation carried on in organised form. The circumstances mentioned here also indicate that an increase in the penalty may be appropriate."}]}

[OccularHedonist (8 points as I type) says]( URL_0 ) \"The heat is held down at lower levels because the atmosphere holds it in like a blanket\", which is sort of correct -- but the holding down happens in the stratosphere, which is higher than any mountain (and therefore doesn't answer the question), and/or is regional rather than based on altitude. ~~[potterarchy (6 points as I type)]( URL_2 ) says that it's greenhouse gases, which is basically the same wrong answer, rephrased.~~ [Florinandrei (5 points as I type)]( URL_1 ) says that it's distance from the heat reservoir of the Earth, which isn't really the answer either. *If you want real answers to questions like this, you are probably better off at /r/askscience, which is more heavily moderated and more heavily frequented by people who actually know the answer to your question*. Here at ELI5 you are likely to get the same kind of easily-memorable but wrong answer that your dad gave you when you were 5. **answer**: The air gets colder as you go up because the lower atmosphere is mixed up by up-and-down winds, which I'll explain in a moment. Air that moves up expands and cools off as it goes up, because all gases cool off as they expand. Air that moves down gets compressed and heats up from the compression. You can notice that kind of cooling if you spray a whole bunch of paint out of one of your dad's cans of spray paint -- the can will get cold from the expansion. You can notice that kind of heating if you pump up a bike tire. The nozzle of the air pump will get hot from the compression. Up and down motions of the air carry a tremendous amount of heat up and down in the part of the atmosphere where we live, and mix it all up. That makes the air at every height above sea level the same temperature as it would be if it just came up from sea level very fast, so up high the air is colder because it just expanded more. That lowest part of the atmosphere is called the \"troposphere\" (pronounced like \"trope oh sphere\"). The reason the troposphere mixes up heat is that air in these bottom, dense layers of the atmosphere is heated by the sunlit ground. Air right near the ground gets warm, then expands and rises (like a hot air balloon, without the balloon). As it rises, it cools off -- but it's still warmer than the cooler air around it, so it carries on rising for a long time -- up to about 20,000 or 30,000 feet above the ground(!) Eventually, that little parcel of air does cool off by radiating heat (like a warm rock cools off if you put it in the shade), and then it sinks all the way back down to the ground again to get some more heat. All of the air in the troposphere does that more or less all the time. That's why airplane rides are bumpy on approach to the airport, particularly on sunny days -- you end up flying through the up and down currents in the air."}]}

So if a percentage of American construction workers left and returned to Mexico, theoretically it should help American workers left. But that might not be the case exactly, or as directly as in theory... Mexican immigrant workers might be paid under the table, reducing overhead costs of paying payroll and other taxes that would need to be done with legal workers. Immigrant workers might be willing to work for wages that just aren't sustainable for American workers, or they might be willing to do the tough/harsh condition/dirty/smelly jobs that Americans wouldn't be willing to do. As costs rise, some jobs will be scaled back or done by one's self, so in reality as costs increase then demand will decrease. For example, let's say somebody want to build a deck in Arizona. Contractor bids $10k and hires 2 undocumented workers for $100 cash daily to assist. Now, they're gone and he has to hire workers and report their incomes, and they want $12/hr., don't want to work after 2pm due to the heat, so now the job's going to need to be charged at $14k and take 2 weeks longer to complete, so they can't move on to the next job.

There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs. Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access. (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.) Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits? Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress. If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit. Lastly, the more I see a fire exit that I can't use, the more I think about it and hopefully in a fire I would rush towards that fire door that I never use but always think about rather then the overflowing regular exit."}]}

Do certain creatures (such as those with greater reaction times or who move quickly) literally perceive time as moving slower?", "output": [{"answer": "This is my own personal \"explanation\" of how we \"feel\" time. Our brains have a certain processing speed, of the information from our senses. This rate determines how time is felt. For instance, you're sitting in a class, bored out of your mind, daydreaming away; because your brain is perceiving the world your body is in, along with simultaneously creating and perceiving the imaginary world you're in, it's processing speed has to be very high. So you feel as if time is extremely slow. Opposite of that, when you're having fun and enjoying yourself, being in moment, present; your brain doesn't have to do much work, only to process the information from your senses. I believe most would agree they aren't thinking much in such cases. Thus, your brain's processing speed is low, making time seem fast. Now I use \"high\" and \"low\" to describe these speeds as I also connect it to effects of drugs. Now for other creatures. I suspect many would perceive time much slower compared to us. Insects, many live mere days compared to our life span; but to the bug, it is it's entire existence. **TL;DR Brain processes information at certain speeds.

{"id": "53furq", "input": "Why is claustrophobia such a common fear, given that our ancestors were cave dwellers?

You don't feel claustrophobic in a house, do you? It's an analogous situation. The sorts of caves commonly used for that purpose would have been reasonably well-lit and spacious (likely less so than your house, but still enough to not feel claustrophobic). Caves were also used for religious rituals, and the claustrophobic feeling was probably an intended effect in those cases. In general claustrophobia would probably be an advantage for a some-time cave using species, because it would encourage members not to go get themselves stuck in small areas of the cave and die. But I don't want to overstate the effect there, because humans have never truly been a cave species. We just used them occasionally and those fossils were much more likely to survive because caves are good at preserving things. A great many people never lived in caves: if nothing else good caves are just not available in many parts of the world."}]}
{"id": "15622k", "input": "Why do we feel warranted stepping into the middle of conflicts halfway around the world but we won't intervene in Mexico and the tragic drug wars?", "output": [{"answer": "Hey kid, don't ever get into fights at school, OK? What I'm about to explain to you is how the bigger world works, but only because there are no teachers. Since you have teachers at your school, you should go to them and they will help you. When I say \"take down the bully\" or \"lose your friends\", I mean getting in trouble so that they're suspended or expelled. So, the school bullies have started being much too aggressive, so now you have created a strike force to stop them. You have 10 friends, and there are 50 bullies. Already you realize you can't take all the bullies at once!! But you and your friends are smart, and can take them out one by one. Now, there are only 4 days of school left (8 if you're re-elected), and you want to make the school safer for the next class. You could always just sit around and play games with your friends. Fighting the bullies would actually make you and your friends more sad, but playing games would make you happier. But you've decided, for the greater good, you'll at least intervene and stop a few bullies while you're there. But now, who do you stop? You can't take on all the bullies at once. And you don't have enough time to take them all out one by one. So you look for which bully is the worst. But perhaps even that isn't the smartest way to do it. Let's say we can rank the bullies as if it's a class. There are A bullies, B bullies, and so on. Of course, it's hard to tell whether a bully is very bad, or you are just wrong and estimated it wrong. You might take down an A bully, but it turns out they were D all along, so your time could have been better spent elsewhere. [*cough* Iraq *cough*] So you have all these bullies and their estimated ranks. It's a simple matter of going after all the A bullies, then the B bullies, and so on. But wait! One of the B bullies is always taking your lunch. You actually have to go back home in the middle of the day and get some food, and then come back to school. This is taking up time [and resources] that could be spent fighting more bullies! So you decide that, even though it's just a B bully, you'll take him out first, since that's smartest. Then you come across a really mean A bully. But he doesn't bully you that much. He bullies more the other bullies, and leaves you alone most of the time. Obviously, you can come back to him later. You find a few others, with different levels of hurting you, but since they only bully you a few times a year, and are actually doing other things, you can come back to them later. Then you come to a really strong and bad A bully. He's hasn't bullied you guys so much, but is really bullying other little innocent kids. You should take him down. But if you take him on, you will lose 5 of your friends. Those friends can actually help you take on more bullies, so you should think about saving this bully for later, and using these friends to take down this big one after those others. But you've decided that this big bully has to be taken down even if you lose 5 of your friends. The problem is, this particular bully won't be alone. While you can take others one by one, this one will get others' help to oppose you. In fact, every time you take down a bully, you are actually making all the bullies more likely to make a team and take you down. So even though you could take down 3 or 4 bullies a day, it might be better to only take down 1 or maybe even 0. In the meantime, you make strategies with your friends about how to take down the bullies as inconspicuously as possible, and also which are the most immediately important and which are not. You're starting to realize that all your friends are listening to you. Some come to you for help since a bully is starting to bully them. Others come with ideas about which bullies to take on that would make things better for yourself and your friends only, but not the other kids. But most of the other kids also support you. You've just realized that you're the one who has the best information about the bullies, and can make decisions which ones to take down first. Everyone will listen to you, since it makes more sense to do your ideas of taking down the school lunch bully first, not taking the super strong one early, and so on. But you also realize that you could easily just say to take down a bully that *isn't* the best bully. Maybe one annoyed you specifically and you want to take him out. Or maybe you could take all the candy from one and you choose him over another. You could easily just pick to take down the bullies that benefits you and your friends the most, without benefiting the other kids, but saying that you're picking the best, and nobody would know. So you have to be careful not to become selfish, since you have so much power. You remember Spiderman, right? With great power comes great responsibility! You'll have to pick your battles, and the same is true later in life. But, I don't want to hear any fighting with bullies at school, am I clear? If somebody bullies you, go to the teacher right away! **TL;DR: complex prioritization with potential for corruption**"}]}

The idea behind it is that you may need critical care in your life, whether it be from a fatal car crash to cancer treatment. However, it's also handy if you have a pathetic cut that won't stop bleeding. Instead of sitting at home trying to sort it out there's care available for you. We pay this through National Insurance that is 10% (?) of our earnings and is taken from us automatically. This guarantees that we have that option there and I believe NI actually funds other things in the government too such as bin collection, roadworks etc. It's very similar to tax. Britain is used to this idea so much that we don't even think about it. We don't pay for doctors visits, consults for certain things, quite a few things that you wouldn't expect to be free because you've technically already paid your way. In America people seem to be really against this because they may never actually be sick in their life, they may never need treatment for anything. That's a consequence that comes with security. While I see the logic behind the idea of American's disdain for the idea, I would think more people would rather be secure. Just me I guess. Car insurance covers the money for someone's car, treatment for a crash, potentially covers the cost for someone else's car. This is pretty basic explaining but it does the same thing as health insurance, but for car accidents. Also, British health insurance covers Ambulances, so we don't pay thousands for that. Makes me quite happy that I don't have to worry about that, but sad that America doesn't see the benefit Edit: okay thanks guys for trying to educate me, but this was just a throwaway comment really, I'm in no way educated on the ACA and get many things wrong. No need to be so emotive, as if you're offended that I'm comparing the 2. However it seems that I will need to look into things before assuming anything. Either way, I still stand by America's model of insurance as ridiculous. Bring in the ANHS, a lot of people will have a shit load taken off them."}]}

{"id": "2pf5iu", "input": "How can our buttholes stretch to accomodate enormous turds with minimal pain, but many people experience pain inserting anything up there, let alone anything that big?", "output": [{"answer": "As someone that's into butt stuff, and more explicitly, putting things into my butt that make even the largest of human penises or epic dumps look laughably small, this is an easy question to answer. Pooping is, for lack of a better word, normal. So when a turd travels through your intestines and finally reaches the \"staging area\" of the human digestive tract, the rectum, the pressure it exerts on the walls of your rectum tells your body that you need to go take a dump. So you go and sit on the toilet. (Which, BTW, is not very good for you, since squatting is the natural position for dropping a deuce and relaxes a [muscle]( URL_0 ) called the [Puborectalis muscle]( URL_1 ) that, if you poop while sitting, doesn't relax and actually makes it harder to poop; using a foot stool while you're passing a stool will allow your body to mimic a squatting posture without actually squatting over the toilet, making it easier and faster for you to poop, helping prevent the formation of hemorrhoids, and allows for more complete elimination of the browns from your proverbial playoff pool) You're used to things exiting your body, and so the muscles that control your butthole relax, allowing for the turd to exit without pain or discomfort. Turds are (if you eat a healthy diet and poop regularly) relatively soft, and contain some amount of water, and a fair amount of mucus that you've either inadvertently or intentionally swallowed and that has been produced by the intestines themselves. But, since the majority of people, male and female and inbetween, aren't used to things going *into* their butts, these muscles don't relax, and often intentionally tighten up when such a stimuli is applied. This resistance, often coupled with a lack of sufficient lubrication, leads to friction, which can cause tears (micro-and-macroscopic) to the rectal and anal lining, which is painful (to say the least). If you acclimatize the body to things being inserted into the anus and rectum, and learn how to manually relax the muscles that control the sphincter (and are in a somewhat relaxed state of mind) and use adequate lubrication, there's no pain at all, or discomfort for that matter. The human anus is actually quite flexible, if trained properly. With enough warm-up and lubrication, some individuals can safely and comfortably accommodate objects as large as 12\"+ in length, and 4\"+ in diameter, or about as large as a foot tall stack of DVD's (I do not recommend trying to put a foot-tall stack of DVD's into your butt). In other words, given enough time, training, and lube, some people's butts have 1.43 Terabytes of storage capacity. And the reason it hurts when you or someone else tries to put something in your butt is because you're not used to it, the muscles that control your butthole tighten, which causes more friction, which leads to tears, which hurt. And even if you do use enough lube, if you try to put *anything* in your butt, no matter the size, without warming it up first, it's still going to hurt because you're forcefully stretching muscles that are contracting. Whereas when you poop, your butthole is relaxed, and the relatively soft dookie can squeeze out of your brown eye like so much of Satans toothpaste. Personally speaking, taking a dump still kinda hurts if the turd is rock-hard, and is usually a sign that you need to eat more fiber and drink more water. EDIT; If my calculations are correct (area of a cylinder 120mm in diameter x 305mm in height, divided by the approximate area of a micro sd card (15mm x 11mm x 1mm length x width x height)) then the area taken up by a one-foot tall stack of DVD's would be anough area for 19,394 micro sd cards. 19,394 times 128gb equals 2.42425 PETABYTES of storage. For comparison, the entire internet is estimated to be 4,883 petabytes large. So that means someone that could fit that stack of DVD's into their ass could fit roughly 0.025% of the internet into their ass. So 4000 masters of the anal arts could fit the entire internet into their collective asses. Each of those 128gb microSD cards retails at 200$.

Jay Porter, a California restauranteur, transitioned his restaurant from a traditional tip system to a No-tip, flat service fee back in 2006, and wrote a [series of blogs]( URL_0 ) describing the experience back in 2013. They're a decent read and a worth a look if you're more interested in the subject, but the long and short of his experience is that people didn't like not being able to punish/reward their servers. He expands that the majority of complaints he got at the restaurant were from men who were upset they couldn't give generous tips to cute female waitresses. I say *perceived* control above, because (and this is only somewhat related the question posted) the idea that \"servers work harder for good tips\" is covered in Porter's blog and as anyone who's worked in a restaurant knows, is pretty much bunk. Servers get paid more when they work more tables, period. In general, customers tip the same no matter what kind of service they got, extreme cases of bad/good service notwithstanding. And since many restaurants pool tips among servers (and often distribute portions to cooks and bus staff as well) each individual server's performance has very little to do with how much that server takes home at the end of the night."}]}

This is why it's the most common material for wiring. - Gold has about 50% higher resistivity than Silver and is very expensive, but does not tarnish or corrode, making it very valuable for spot applications like electronic contacts. - Aluminum is about 12% more resistive than Gold, does not corrode (or actually has a self-limiting surface corrosion), is very cheap and physically strong.

{"id": "29e4vu", "input": "Is there ever an advantage for an average person to lease a new car vs buying it?", "output": [{"answer": "IIT there seems to be an awful lot of assumptions and \"that sounds right\" logic, but no insider knowledge. I used to agree that there leasing was basically for suckers who wanted to own a car beyond their means, but my brother (who works in a dealership) convinced me otherwise. Like everything, there is a tradeoff but according to him, leasing is actually kind of win win for both parties. Buying: When you buy a car, it is yours and you do whatever you want with it. Personally, this is a big plus, but financially, maybe not the wisest move. You see, your car loses value as soon as it goes from new to used so one month in, you owe most of the car which has lost a substantial amount of value. With homes, people tend to sell them (and panic) but for some reason, they don't think about it with cars. Leasing: This benefits the dealership because, like some assumed, they still own the car at the end of the day. However, they own a 2-5 yr old car which is worth a whole lot less than when you first started using it. The reason dealerships will take this deal anyways is because there is a definite market for used cars and a need to have a used car inventory. Leasing often ties you to the dealership for maintenance, so they have definite records of how good the car is (important for warranties etc). Believe it or not, this actually benefits the consumer many times too. Whether we realize it or not, people who tend to buy a new car, also tend to want an even newer car 5-7 years down the road. If they bought, they paid a lot more than a lease, for a car that is worth way less now. For people who buy a car until it breaks down, the old car often further drains you with maintenance after the 100k mark where more expensive parts need to be purchased and cars tend to become unreliable. Things to know: Older cars become less valuable, and more so at high mileage points. For this reason, the dealership puts strict rules and steep fees for driving more than the allotted miles. If you have no choice and KNOW you will use more than the miles provided, my brother recommends you BUY and not lease. However, he does suggest you buy a certified used car as the economic drop of a car going from new to used is simply not worth it. This is obviously, his advice to me as his brother, but often tells this to customers too. However, intangibles like piece of mind don't have a set value, and many customers decide to buy new anyways. Deals: Some people ITT mentioned about deals. The profit margin for a new car (lease or sold) is actually quite small so saying \"give me your best price\" isnt going to work. For this reason, you will rarely find an amazing deal from dealership to dealership as they are all buying from the same company. Essentially, a 2015 Honda Accord will be the same base price in any Honda dealership. The biggest difference is in financing which can vary depending on how big of a risk a dealership wants to take on your creditworthiness (and this is actually what you probably want to focus on if getting a new car). Deals do exist with used cars though. For some reason, many dealerships will sell a used car for a loss if they have had it for too long. It is pretty much just taking up space. Trade ins: We didn't discuss this (my brother and I), but generally, you will get less than your car is worth for a trade in. However, it is usually likely they will take it, so some people are okay with eating the loss. He always sells his own cars to private parties. Loyalty: With this 5-7 year new car trend, dealerships rely A LOT on return customers and referrals. While of course, the dealership wants to make as much money as possible, they would also rather sell you two cars than one. For this reason, dealerships generally play it safe across the board and would rather make their money with add ons than with totally ripping you off on the base price of a new car.

Shows don't have to be made a specific length per episode, since they don't have to fit into a time slot. They don't have to end every episode on a cliffhanger to get you coming back to watch it the next week. They don't have to make scenes end after certain intervals to have room for a commercial break. Netflix allows producers of their shows to determine how they want to format the show, and how they want to release it. Releasing the whole produced season all at once is the common choice because it allows the viewers the most choice of how to watch the show, since they can binge it all at once, or they can pace themselves at a slower pace. The nature of it being a stream you can watch at your own schedule enables the shows to do things a normal TV show couldn't, and producers are experimenting with the freedom. Broadcast shows are usually entirely filmed and just need some post production before the first episode of the season broadcasts, so they could just release the whole season in one run, but shows are competing for prime time slots to have the most viewers, so that the ads running during the show are the most valuable. The actors still get the same amount of work in front of the camera either way, just how long it takes to become available to us varies, and a show can be cancelled before the produced episodes finish airing, ala Threshold. There are some shows on broadcast that only get produced half a season at a time, like V, since the writers strike about a decade ago made the mid-season hiatus standard."}]}

This can be something that's going on behaviorally, for example someone picking their skin due to OCD, it can be due to brain chemistry like when the dopamine receptors in the brain get all funky and cause some types of depression, or a combination of both. If you look at the language in the DSM 5, it actually gives you your answer. Not all pedophiles have \"pedophillic disorder.\" There's a big old IF in the middle of the sentence - it's only a disorder if it's making it difficult to pursue a normal life. What the DSM 5 did was take pedophilia and put it on a spectrum similar to many other mental disorders. It acknowledges the fact that some people have pedophillic thoughts and are able to ignore them and carry on with their lives as though those thoughts never happen, while for others it can have a significant enough impact on their lives to cause real problems.

How could they have not anticipated that much stronger countries allied to Kuwait would intervene and drive them out?", "output": [{"answer": "While a lot of posts are mentioning the western viewpoint of why people think Iraq did it there are very few actually telling the real viewpoint why Saddam did it. - Kuwait was actually drilling into wells that were accessed by Iraq siphoning oil off their reserves (some people mentioned this, but it was basically the last straw so to speak) - Kuwait had absolutely TONS of oil reserves keeping the prices low which really really hurt Iraq at the time which had a lot of debt from the Iraq / Iran war. - Kuwait and Baghdad had a partnership that went back hundreds of years. Iraqi's were the major reason why Kuwait became a commercial boom center (long before oil) As you can see from the [border]( URL_0 ) It's got a huge port and a lot more coastline in the Gulf. All very valuable and since it was Iraqis who made that port into the boom country it is (before oil) and now it's mega rich with oil, it makes a lot of sense. So to sum up the why. - Kuwait was siphoning off oil - Had gigantic reserves keeping the price low - Iraq had a lot of debt from a previous war - Historically Iraqi's helped make Kuwait what it is today All of that is the reason why. Saddam had the means, the need, and both present and past reasons to do it. Now on to why Saddam thought nobody would care in the Western world. - First off the US/West really hadn't been involved in the regions conflicts all that much. They would sell arms, send support that way, but not actually get involved militarily. Russia did in Afghanistan, but that was them, and the west really wasn't into doing that sort of thing. - He was actually correct about that. The west really didn't care at all about the region enough to get involved at all in a hands on sort of way. In fact Britain got out of a lot of places in the last 50 years. But the economic interest isn't what he expected at all. - Kuwait has billions upon billions of pounds in British banks. The reason is because of the alliance Mubarak made with the crown a long time ago when Britain was looking for influence in the region to help with trade routes to/from India. Basically later Britain agreed to defend Kuwait and ensure its National Security, and Kuwait agreed to give it a secure oil supply. - This was Saddam's miss calculation. Britain's tie to Kuwait was VERY big. Billions in British pounds at very very cheap oil prices. If Britain didn't honor the agreement to protect Kuwait, Kuwait would pull its money out of the British banks. Now if you think the housing collapse in the US is bad, Kuwait pulling out of its British investments would have been absolutely a killer to the British economy. (Kuwait invested like 5 billion in Spain in the late 80s that basically was a bust, but they have that kind of money where they are annoyed but no big deal. ) So when Britain saw Iraq invade Kuwait they had to do something, not because the care about the Kuwait people. They did it because their economy depended on it, and if their economy depends on it...The US economy depended on it. So What Saddam missed was the major economic threat that Kuwait was going to serve Britain if they didn't get their ass over there and kick out Saddam. This also set up the whole Iraq war 2 Electric Bugaloo with Tony Blair. \"George W. Bush: Hey remember when my dad saved your ass with the whole Saddam thing? Well it's time to pay us back, don't worry we'll cut you in for a piece of that oil action\", and that's why Blair and Bush were joined at the hip for Iraq part 2. So what did Saddam not understand? That Britain was economically heavily tied to Kuwait so much so that they had to intervene no matter what or risk going into a massive recession, which would send the US into one."}]}

By the time that the food gets to the small intestines, it is a soupy fluid that is chock full of enzymes. As the food travels through the intestinal tract, many things happen...the fluid and food particles are absorbed, the enzymes start to degrade, and what is left starts to firm up and form what we in the health care field call poop. Most of this process occurs in the large intestine and it usually takes between 12 and 24 hours for that Big Mac to complete the whole process of digestion from start to finish. When a person has diarrhea, the motility of the intestines is increased, meaning that the contents of the intestine are moved more quickly through the intestines. This means that the liquid poop in the small intestine with all the enzymes that are meant to digest the food that has been eaten is passed throught the intestines and out the rectum before the enzymes have had a chance to degrade. This is why diarrhea is liquid and the burning sensation is a result of the active enzymes acting on the sensitive tissue of the anus. Thereyago. Source: Yahoo answers"}]}
{"id": "67fw7m", "input": "Why are flowers attractive to humans even if we might not get any reward (fruit, nectar) from them?", "output": [{"answer": "Our sense of smell and our sense of taste are very connected. When food has spoiled, the aromas given off by bacterial or other activity are apparent to us... isovaleric acid with rancid milk, butyric acid which smells like vomit or bile, aromatic indoles that smell like poop or manure, or the vinegar of acetic acid. We have built in aversion to these smells due to evolutionary pressures and the back of our head \"knowing\" these are linked with nasty biological processes such as spoiled food or rotten meat. When a fruit, or an orange, smells sweet and tasty, we're smelling the oils of the plan and other aromas. Many flowers that you might not think of as edible, actually are (even dandelion weeds can and are made into a tea, and lavender has culinary uses for instance). Fruits, too, are often \"flowers\", pear trees have flowers and many fruits are \"flowering fruits\". So there are evolutionary reasons for a human to smell the flower and be sure they aren't smelling something weird like acetic acid (meaning that maybe some berries have gotten gross and fermented). Cooking flowers in the west isn't done so much these days, but before artificial flavors and other ways of cooking, it was a lot more prevalent, but you still see this in people making herbal teas for example; the chemicals given off are pleasant, sometimes linked to chemical signals that mean \"food\" and other complex flavors (bitter, after all, is a flavor too). Someone in the comments mentioned corpse flowers and how their rotting smell attracts insects like flies, etc.; this is of course the opposite extreme where the flower is releasing isovaleric acid and other compounds into the air; flies which WANT to find and smell rotting corpses think \"Oh hell yes, some corpses over there\" and have an evolutionary impulse to go over there. Edit: People keep bringing up roses as an example of \"useless\" flowers not linked to evolutionary pressures... Umm, hello? Rosewater in cooking anyone? Turkish delight? Roses have TONS of culinary uses, and it's linked to the aromatic compounds they release that, like many of the plants that we cultivate for straightforward culinary purposes, both activate our sense of smell and taste (and most importantly, do not activate any instinctive aversion)."}]}

We know women place more emphasis on the fragrance of a product than men (some men being happy to purchase without smelling the product at all). At least when it comes to bathroom products, men and women discriminate on price differently. Men are more likely to take a cheaper product and see that product as equivalent.

Generally speaking there is little to no wage gap for the same work in the same field/position. The wage gap is simply taking all income of full time earners of men vs women in the country and comparing them. This \"gap\" of all overall earned income between the sexes doesn't take into account actual hours worked, education level, position, fields they elect to go into, etc. Women as a whole tend to work less hours, in jobs that are less stressful/dangerous, have more flexibility with hours and choose to go into fields that are generally less paying than men. This among many other similar factors is what contributes to the vast majority of the wage gap. There's a lot of propaganda and misleading information in the news/media that try to make people believe otherwise, but it goes against all facts and data. It's more of a politically correct argument than a sound/rational one. The truth is that women are more likely to get a degree and in nearly all metropolitan areas of the US single, childless women earn more than men. As these trends continue in favor of women, young men have begun to speak out and advancing the myth of the wage gap is slowly becoming less politically correct as the current generation of workers enter the job market and find that men are actually less \"privileged\" than women in many regards. The \"wage gap\" is largely a product of life choices that women and families make for themselves and not something that can be explained squarely as a product of bias in the workplace."}]}

If you're talking about the fires in California right now like in the Napa Valley those are not regular forest fires, those are firestorms. A firestorm is a result of a fire that burns so hot that it actually changes the weather around it and causes air to be sucked into the base of the Flames causing them to burn even hotter which causes more air to be sucked in and the Flames to burn even hotter... the result is a wall of flame several stories tall moving faster than what you can legally do on some freeways. The time difference from when you first see the Flames to when you are literally being burned by the Flames can be 2 to 3 minutes. Now you might say that it is possible to get away from a fire in 2 to 3 minutes but I'll remind you that in most places of the world roads do not go directly away from disasters. Especially in places that are literally valleys or Canyons where there are only one or two roads out of an area meaning sometimes your last evacuation route is actually towards the flames and you need to just shelter in place. Sheltering in place can be an acceptable Last Resort but considering the raw power of a firestorm there's really no hope, we're even seeing melted engine blocks from the devastation areas so there's really nothing you can do to hide from it. For those in the path if they did not evacuate when it was 25 miles away (the next town over) they may not have had a chance to leave at all. So stop and consider what is 25 miles away from you, and think that if that was a natural disaster, would you evacuate from your city just because of what's happening 25 miles away?

Now both exchanges work a little differently and what it comes down to is whether or not those Market Makers hold their own inventory of shares or not. But in the end the purpose of the Market Maker is to maintain an orderly market. They will match orders with buyers and sellers in an actively traded security.

Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (\"extravasate\"). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to \"skin popping\", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial \"intradermal\" injection. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses.

In fact the insurance companies can't either, but the providers are trying to milk out as much as they can. They are trying to capture as much of the [economic surplus]( URL_0 ) as possible. In negotations for price, the rule of thumb is to always come in higher than what you want because the other party will try to lower the price. This applies to healthcare. Whenever a healthcare provider renders a service, they send a claim to the insurance company you have on file. This could be private carriers like AETNA and BCBS or public ones like Medicaid and Medicare. Say they send a claim with a list of items like this: - Procedure 1 - $10,000 - Procedure 2 - $ 5,000 - Procedure 3 - $ 2,500 The insurance company will only cover as much as it is obligated to under contract, and it has max payouts for every procedure. So I have insurance company HealthShield. HealthShield receives the claim, and sends back an [EOB (Explanation of Benefits)]( URL_1 ). The EOB says that HealthShield will pay the following: - Procedure 1 - $8,000 - Procedure 2 - $4,800 - Procedure 3 - $2,500 So the healthcare provider gets it back and sees that all of Procedure 3 was covered. That means that HealthShield's max payout could be higher, so the provider wants to charge more in order to not leave money on the table. What about Procedures 1 and 2? They weren't entirely paid for? The provider expected this. They can either try to file another claim with a secondary insurance (some people have more than one), they could write it off (like the $200 for Procedure 2), or they can directly bill the patient. Because of inflation and government ineptitude, this becomes a ratcheting effect that continuously raises prices. That is why medical bills are ridiculously expensive. =========== A little extra for you (not so ELI5ish): In order to capture as much economic surplus as possible, they need to have different rates for different insurances (including government ones). Different rates also occur because insurance companies have leverage and can get lower rates for the procedures they are contractually obliged to pay by guaranteeing bulk quantity of said procedure. Because insurance companies have leverage to lower rates, and because providers need to avoid the appearance of fraud for arbitrarily assigning rates, the providers gouge the price to the uninsured. That is why medical bills are ludicrously expensive for the uninsured. =========== Source: I'm a medical billing software programmer Edit: clarified grammar Also, when I said write off, I should have been more clear. Because of the different types of insurance that prefer certain providers and negotiate better rates, the provider agrees to accept whatever the amount happens to be and isn't allowed to bill the patient for the remainder.

Beau had very, very strong opinions on masculine fashion and exerted a huge influence over the king. Beau developed his own style, which he called Dandy, and the King adopted that style. Beau believed in finely tailored suits, in dark, simple colors, worn with a necktie. He eschewed make-up and perfumes, and thought men shouldn't wear jewelry. This was, of course, at the height of the British Empire, and literally *millions* of men copied the King's style, which meant they were copying Beau Brummel's style. Even foreign dignitaries adopted the style. Men's fashion has changed some since Brummel's time -- long tails on coats are no longer popular, pants aren't worn so tight or high-waited, but the basic elements of male style -- especially in formal wear -- haven't changed much in 200 years. If you wear dark slacks, a white shirt, a necktie, short hair, clean-shaven, and avoid make-up and jewelry -- i.e. if you dress like most businessmen of the last 200 years -- then you're dressing as Beau Brummel intended. There's literally no one who has had as profound an impact on male fashion."}]}
{"id": "2z8r95", "input": "What is the difference between love, infatuation and lust, and how do you identify which one are you feeling?", "output": [{"answer": "Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love does a decent job of covering this. Imagine a triangle. At each corner of the triangle you have Intimacy, Passion or Commitment. Intimacy involves feelings of closeness, attachment and the sharing of personally relevant information. Passion involves feelings of physical attraction, thinking about someone all the time, wanting to be near someone all the time. Commitment encompasses short term commitments (staying together) and long term commitments (making plans for the future). With just passion you experience lust. With just intimacy you experience liking. With just commitment you experience empty love (imagine a couple that's together just because they don't believe in divorce) Passion + Intimacy is Romantic Love, which is the honeymoon phase of the relationship. You're building a foundation for later commitment by spending lots of time together, sharing lots of personal information about yourself with this person, having lots of sex or engaging in other acts of physical affection and everything they do is funny and endearing and perfect. This is often also described as \"limerence\" (term coined by Dorothy Tennov). However, limerence is used to describe the somewhat negative aspects of this honeymoon phase in which one's thoughts, emotions, needs and behaviors are intrusive, involuntary, often obsessive in nature and contingent upon your perception of their same feelings---this is the \"omg I can't stop thinking about him, why hasn't he called me back, I'm literally going to die if I don't hear from him\" phase of the relationship, which I think accurately describes \"infatuation\". Intimacy + Commitment is Companionate Love. Think of your best friend or your close sibling. You love this person, no doubt about that, but it's purely platonic. You'd take a bullet for them, bail them out of jail, beat the crap out of anyone who hurt them but you don't want to sleep with them. It's different from just normal friendships because of the long term commitment. This kind of love is also seen in long term marriages where passion is no longer present. Passion + Commitment is Fatuous Love. It's getting married to someone you just met or marrying someone so that you can have sex with them. You haven't established an intimate bond with this person but you're already making promises to be together or take a trip together or leave your spouse for them. Passion + Intimacy + Commitment is Consummate Love which is what we typically think of when we talk about Love-love. This is \"The Notebook\" caliber love. You've established intimacy with this person over time and across situations. You've made a commitment to them (either an emotional commitment like marriage or a tangible commitment like buying a house or having a child together). You also feel passion toward them---when you're with them, you're touching or somehow maintaining your connection to each other and when you're not with them, you think about them and want to share your experiences with them when you reunite. Now, other people have other theories about love and what it means, but Sternberg's theory is (I think) the best theory for comparing and contrasting the different kinds of love and attraction.

Imagine a scene being filmed on green screen with a motion capture actor, ala Gollum in Lord of the Rings. They do the scene and when the director is satisfied it'll have to get the CGI treatment. The green screens are filled in with a background and 3D actors/objects added. Now CGI in film is just like CGI in games, but it can't just look good, it's gotta look real which means a lot more complexity for the 3D model, textures, lighting, etc. Now games just like film convey motion by the rapid succession of still frames. Movies are generally 24 frames per second, that is there are 24 still frames shown in 1 second, with modern 3D games being between 30-60 frames per second. The difference is that with CGI a computer has to render or \"draw\" everything as opposed to it all being burned onto the surface of a light sensitive film spinning on a reel. This means a lot of work for the computer and the more complex the longer it takes to render. So a video game is real-time 3D rendering meaning everything is being drawn by the computer as you play. Whereas a movie uses pre-rendered CGI meaning the computer drew it and the frame was saved, then the next frame was drawn and saved, and so on and so on. I think they can do about a frame a second on modern hardware, so 24 seconds gives you a second of film time. It used to be much longer. This is why CGI is so expensive because of it's meticulous nature. Now if you're wondering why it's so intensive for a computer to render 3D think of the 3D models in a video game, they're made up of polygons which are basically flat triangles connected by the edges to form a 3 dimensional object. So the rounder you want something to look the more polygons it needs and the more polygons the more processing for the computer. Now that's just one factor, textures are equally as important as is lighting. Oh and the by the way light doesn't actually reflect like in reality. If a 3D objects wants to appear to be affected by a light source it has to be manipulated in a way so that it looks like it was. So when a rocket flies down a hallway and the flame reflects as a red light on the walls following it down the hallway, the computer is actually changing the color of the walls according to the position of the light source. When they do this to a scene with Gollum or Optimus Prime, the computer has to redraw every polygon every time they move and render their textures with the lighting effects. There's probably more polygons in one of Optimus Prime's tires than there are in an entire PlayStation 1 game."}]}
{"id": "z0pf8", "input": "What makes Beethoven, Mozart and Bach better than other classical music composers?", "output": [{"answer": "Although I agree with some of the other good answers here, you also need to make a distinction between compositional technique, and the music that results from it. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven all share the qualities of being some of the most innovative and technically virtuosic in terms of technique. However, one could also argue that Webern was incredibly virtuosic in compositional technique, but hardly anyone listens to his music any more. So clearly the actual music is important in how it withstands the test of time. But to explain (hopefully in a simple way) how compositional technique plays into all of this, I will try to provide a few examples. Bach was considered a master of *counterpoint* - which is a term to describe music made up of multiple interlocking melody lines. A very simple example is singing in a round - imagine Row, Row, Row Your Boat sung by three groups starting at different times. You end up with distinct melody lines that interlock and sound cool together. What Bach did was basically take that concept (not necessarily the same melody, but ones that fit well together) and run with it. He was known to write up to five or six separate voices that all lined up and sounded cool pretty much all the time. By contrast, most other composers of his time rarely made it past four voices, and even then some screwed up and it didn't sound as pretty. Mozart was known for being incredibly prolific as well as being a musical genius. Mozart may well be so famous simply because he wrote SO MUCH music - he wrote 41 symphonies in his (relatively short) lifetime, compared to Beethoven who wrote only 9, yet lived much longer. Mozart wrote in almost every genre (except for an inexplicable hatred of the cello) and almost every instrument has Mozart works that feature them. Mozart was also a child prodigy and developed a substantial performance career by the time he was 7 or 8 years old. Because of his incredibly performance skill (similar to later composers like Liszt) he was able to write music that really pushed the performer's skill at the instrument, especially in piano and violin. Since that was also a time where the piano as an instrument was evolving rapidly, it became increasingly important to develop repertoire that pushed the technical constraints of the instrument, which Mozart did very successfully. Beethoven, in contrast to Mozart, was known for his skills in *motivic development* - that is, taking one short musical idea (a motive) and finding creative ways to continue using that idea throughout a whole piece. Consider one of his most famous works, Symphony No. 5. Everyone has heard those opening four notes - \"duhduhduh DUN\" - and the majority of the first movement essentially used and reused those four notes for upwards of 6-7 minutes of music, an awfully long time to not get bored of four notes. Beethoven is considered skillful expressly because he used relatively little new material, but still somehow made his pieces interesting and tell a story and make sense on an emotional level. This is what many composers strive for today, and could arguably be seen as the impetus for modern musical movements like minimalism. Besides that, of course, all three composers were not only well known simply for their own music, but because they managed to withstand the test of time by having people continue to advocate for their music after their deaths. Actually, Bach was not all that famous once he died - it wasn't until Felix Mendelssohn \"rediscovered\" and popularized his music that people acknowledged Bach as more than some random old dude who wrote a few hits back in his day. Although Mozart and Beethoven didn't have as dramatic a change in fame, their music remains popular because people have kept their music alive through performance and study. And while this might be slightly outside of the scope of your original question, there is also a more practical aspect. Many performers of classical music are subject to as much marketing as anything else in order to make a living. In other words, orchestras (for example) have to market their product to the public in order to keep ticket sales up and advertising revenue going. Since certain composers have an extremely high amount of name recognition, many orchestras will choose to perform pieces by those composers, hoping that they will draw in a wider audience than performing more obscure music that only caters to a small niche community. Then, because these orchestras primarily perform \"popular\" classical music, those are the pieces that most people hear about or actually attend concerts or buy recordings. They know they like those pieces, and continue to go to see the \"greatest hits\". Other than a small population of \"classical connoisseurs\", most people are unlikely to risk seeing a concert of really obscure pieces they've never heard before - there's too much variation in classical music to guarantee that you'll like a piece by an unknown composer, and for people who are not trained in music, it may not be very interesting because the differences in classical music are often more difficult to hear without knowing what to look for (which is another ELI5 topic to itself, I think). So, in short, because it's easier and more profitable to continue playing Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, it tends to be the music that sticks around especially if you are not deep in your local classical music scene. Other composers are just as \"good\" in the sense that you can definitely enjoy listening to their music just as much. But they haven't broken into the ubiquitous fame that those three have. **as a caveat to anyone who might criticize, I'm using the term \"classical\" in the standard vernacular sense meaning music from the Western art music tradition during the Common Practice Period (ca. 17th-19th centuries) or music that seeks to actively follow or emulate those musical styles. As for source, I'm just your average music major who dreams of studying musicology, which helps explains many of these questions."}]}

Alright here goes: In Saudi Arabia, for a long time now, all women have been listed as dependents of wither their father or their husband. This means that much of their legal standing in govt is derived from this dependence. If foreign workers come to work in Saudi, they are listed as dependents of their sponsors. Now, all women need permission/approval from their guardian in this system to leave the country. Until about 2 years ago, this was done by women needing to have a yellow slip signed. 2 years ago however, the govt instituted an electronic system to allow approvals to be done faster (online). This was merged with the system that Passport office uses to control the permissions for foreign workers as well. Just this year however, someone decided that it would be a good idea to send an SMS to the sponsor/guardian whenever one of their dependents left the country. This option was always available as an opt in, but has just been changed to opt out so suddenly everybody has started getting these SMSes. The whole sponsorship system in Saudi is pretty backwards but what is going on here is not a malicious attempt to track women, its more of an upgrading of a system thats outdated and should be scrapped.

Nowadays, it's pretty much wide-open. Part 2) has mostly been a public thing until the 1960's but the tide is turning back to more private involvement. It used to be a way for the governement to get their hand on all the energy and then redistribute it \"equally\". Part 3) has pretty much been well covered in all the answers. You grant a monopoly to: a) stimulate companies to spend millions and billions of dollars on the local infrastructure; b) avoid parallel forests of pylons in cities and c) most importantly, to allow the the deployment of a full grid that realizes the numerous advantages of a \"grid effect\" (namely rerouting, balancing). There you go my friend! EDIT: oh, I forgot to mention about the energy brokers... Nowadays, some private companies are allowed to buy energy from the producers, transporters or even distributors, and then market that energy and of course, sell it to consumers.

Or do they use programs that they direct to a site?", "output": [{"answer": "PART 2 I worked at this store during the day, and dived into coding at night. Eventually I came across Offensive Security, the developers of BackTrack (at the time), and now Kali. These guys know their stuff, and several of their team members were responsible for writing many excellent pieces of exploit code (they run an exploit database called exploitdb). They offered a course called \"PWB\" or \"Pentesting With BackTrack\". $750.00 and I was in. The course was not like most technical certification courses you see. There was courseware to work through, videos to watch, and demos to try. But there is also a lab, filled with mock systems, that you hack your way through, attempting to pivot into more important areas of the network, from user space to admin space. The exam was 24 hours, and actually tested your skills. You had to proove you could hack and steal flags as verification of these skills. You couldn't use automated tools (you had one lifeline so to speak), and you really had to look for holes in design, and configuration etc. I passed the exam and thought \"This is definitely what I want to do\". I applied for a job as a security analyst at a small security consulting firm. I had 0 experience on paper, but a friend of mine worked for a company that was a large client of theirs, and said \"give him a shot\" so they did. I got the job and dived right in. One year later I was working on the penetration testing team, and 6 months after that I was the team lead. I furthered my Offensive Security training and completed their \"Cracking the Perimeter\" course. This was much more advanced, and the exam was a 48 practical. I slept for maybe three or four hours in order to complete and pass it. I did some malware forensics during my time at this firm, as they sometimes didn't have enough staff to fill client requests, so I learned about malware in an in depth way. So I started building it. There is a fine line between malware and the tools I use to conduct pentests. And it is at THIS point I feel we get into your \"serious level hacking\" question, and where I feel the other answers aren't detailed enough to explain how people learn to hack. Most penetration testers you meet, and firms developing projects for clients to conduct penetration tests, look at a list of systems provided by the client and say \"Yes it will be $X to conduct vulnerability scanning and penetration testing on these 50 systems and three web applications\". And to Mr.or Mrs. Client, they think \"OK these guys know their stuff\". This is fundamentally flawed. The goal of any good penetration test, and tester, should be one thing; to access whatever it is that is critical to the client. If you are a software development company that happens to have a wordpress blog (I'll never understand why companies like fucking wordpress so much) that is hosted on  URL_0  or wherever else, and doesn't connect to your internal network, who gives a shit if some script-kiddy knocks it offline (unless reputational damage is a big deal). Keep backups, blow the thing out, and bring it back online. What you should be interested in, is what you consider critical... in the case of the software company, likely source code, maybe custom tools used for development processes etc. That is where a real \"hacker\" comes in. You don't want someone who is going to say \"yup their is a sql injection vulnerability on your website and using that I found the admin password\". Run automated vulnerability scans, plug the results into Metasploit Pro and click run, and you will see that same information. You want someone who is going to make a better argument than your IT team. Your IT team says \"We have a complete control instance to protect our source code. We have firewalls, an IDS or IPS, McAfee anti-virus, and mail filters. We are in good shape.\" Maybe the IT team tested all of these components individually and they worked. McAfee found some sample malware they put on the system and cleaned it, the firewalls only allow outbound traffic to HTTP(S) for users, and only limited connections where necessary for servers etc. They have a DMZ, they have IDS alerts sent to IT when they hit a certain criticality threshold. User's don't have admin rights to their systems, and there are only a set number of admins on the network. On paper, this seems great. A firm comes in, they scan the firewalls, find no holes, send a payload to a user and the mail filters pick it up. The users computers are running the latest windows patches, and every patch Tuesday, IT updates the systems. The websites don't show any SQL injection, or any high risk vulnerabilities at all. Then we get someone who actually knows what they are doing, and is going to OBSESS about getting your source code from you, to prove their argument is better. They aren't just going to run tools, they aren't just going to look for known exploits that are 0-to-Root."}]}

You aren't paying into a fund and expecting to get back what goes in. The insurance company isn't tracking what you've put in and expecting you to make it back. You are put into a pool of similar risks. i.e. Male 25 years old, drives a 3 year old red sports car, 3 speeding convictions, no crashes in the last 3 years. Or Female 57, drives 10 year old sedan, 0 convictions, 1 crash  < $5000. Both these characters have a risk, calculated by decades of crash data. Based on the risk, you get assigned a pool populated by other people with the same risk. From the insurance company's point of view, all that matters is that they did a good job on statistics, and that over each pool, they don't see any significant excess of predicted crashes. In each pool they expect $x amount of claims each year. They just take that total, divide by the number of the people in the pool, add a bit for admin overhead  &  profit, and bingo, there is your insurance rate. So what happens when you have a crash and your rates go up? Your rates are going up because when you get into that negotiation with them, you are going to end up in a different pool Instead of \"male 47 years old, no crash, 1 speeding conviction\" you end up in \"male 47 years old, 1 complete loss, 1 speeding conviction\" Based on their stats, the latter pool has a higher expected claims rate than the former, so you end up paying more. Over time, if you stay out of trouble, you can end up back in the same pool you started with, but this is based on risk, not how much you've spent or cost them. Hope that helps."}]}

Women, on the other hand, are from the void dimension. Although you might think that means they technically don't exist, they are really complex patterns of tendency toward nothingness. They feed on extremes, because they need the energy gradient. They reduce everything they interact with to the average energy level, but need extremes to sustain themselves, because it is the process of reduction that keeps them alive. Physically, this manifests as extremely hot showers, often followed by ice cream, or in some cases sitting directly in front of a fan or AC while wet. When their needs aren't met, they seek to incite and create extremes in their environment which they can then sustain themselves on. ..like men, though, their bodies naturally trend toward 98.7 degrees (although there's some small variance in the baseline), and there's only so much their bodies can take.

There are many, many factors involved and much of it is poorly understood. I'll try to be ELI5 friendly, but if I fail please tell me and I'll try again. Some viruses are very well adapted to their reservoir host. This means that they can \"live\" within that host without doing much, if any, damage. For humans, herpes viruses could be a good example of this. Most often in this case, the virus has \"lived\" within that host for a very long time (from an evolutionary perspective). As the host evolves ways to combat the virus, the virus evolves right back. This is called co-evolution. There is a tendency for these viruses to evolve to be less damaging over time. However, if one of these viruses co-evolved to a different host happens to infect a human successfully, it can be... very bad. We are a different host, with different biology and a different immune system. The virus is not \"co-evolved\" with us and it can make us sick in a way that it doesn't make its other host sick.

{"id": "6pbww7", "input": "the lack of biped land animals", "output": [{"answer": "Something you have to remember is that birds *are* dinosaurs, and inherited their bipedalism from their ancestors. As to why many species are not primarily bipedal, bipedalism has some advantages (it raises the head, increasing the field of view and making it easier to climb and wade) it also has severe disadvantages. Walking on two legs puts a lot of strain on the hips and lower back. To compensate, the hips narrow. This makes birthing more difficult and painful, which in turn leads to earlier births (so that the baby isn't as large) which in turn leads to more vulnerable, helpless, and slow growing children. Lower back problems are also common as people grow, which makes them more vulnerable to predation. Four legged movement eliminates some of these problems, increases speed, and makes crouching/hiding easier (good for both predators and prey). It's also theorized that humans adapted to an endurance model of hunting, simply exhausting prey until they couldn't run anymore, then killing them, of which bipedalism is a byproduct to multiple skeletal and muscular changes."}]}

For instance, a new video game in the US is $60, but the same game is $110 in Australia. This is because of historical exchange rates... $110 in Australia takes about the same amount of \"work\" to earn as $60 in the US. Using points allows you to have items be the same cost (in points) while accounting for the regional differences. Finally, it allows the company to only track ONE digital currency instead of having to support \"wallets\" in dozens of currencies. Discounting: You can change the cash-exchange value of points in order to have sales or whatnot, without upsetting supply chains or causing dissonance. It's a lot harder to sell $10 game credit for $5 than it is to sell 800 points for $5 (in terms of the supply chain and retailers) Legal: Keeping values listed in real currency can make you subject to laws surrounding those (like store gift cards), which may include mandatory offerings of cash refunds, expiration or privacy implications. Conversely, points are exempt from all these considerations, making things infinitely easier on the legal department, who would otherwise need to track the laws in every single state and country they service. Not to mention that if you're managing a Stored Value System denominated in currency, you may fall afoul of bank laws and regulations. This happened to PayPal - it's legally considered a bank in Europe and Australia, and is subject to full banking regulations in those areas.

So the easiest way to address this is to add air support and give outdated equipment to allies.

Unlike the US, Russia will indiscriminately bomb all groups against the Syrian government including both the rebels and ISIS. Their goal is to polarize the war and have two sides by removing the different factions, convincing the international community to support Assad. At the same time Russia is pulling out of Ukraine to try to appease the international community to remove their sanctions.

{"id": "52fcxa", "input": "If the majority of both genders have interests in sex, why hasn't our society become open and blatant about who we want to sleep with?", "output": [{"answer": "Most answers have focused on religion. While religion is a part of it, I don't think it's the sole answer. The primary purpose that sex was naturally-selected for is procreation. Procreation carries a pretty severe burden, and for humans that burden lasts for a very long time and depending on the family connection might not every truly end until the death of either the parent or the child. Unless there's a strong environmental push to have children, from an intellectual point of view it's a lot easier to *not* have children. Children are expensive. Children take a lot of time. Children prevent the parent from simply doing whatever the parent wants to do. This goes on in greater or lesser amounts for close to two decades. As a society we've deemed it important enough for parents to at least financially pay for their kids that a parent that leaves the family will have part of wages taken by the government to be used to pay for that child. Even an animalistic approach to procreation though, someone has to raise the child. For a lot of animals this burden falls almost entirely on the mother, for some others the father may be involved, even if only to help protect his children. The point of all of this, is that this is an awful lot of work, and the trick to make it all happen is to make sex desirable. Very desirable. Arguably the single most desirable thing that one wants to do. So desirable that it overrides any sense of reason and logic in the person, that the consequences of sex, like making babies, is downplayed or forgotten. Humans have figured out how to have sex while reducing the odds of making a baby, but this has only come about with any real reliability or ubiquity in cultures that allow it in the last century. Up until the last century, even possibly the last fifty years, sex carried fairly good odds of pregnancy. Even today, people misuse or fail to use methods to prevent pregnancy, unplanned pregnancy happens all of the time, even to people with easy access to means to avoid pregnancy and with the knowledge on how to use that means. Culture changes slowly. Think about that culture has evolved over thousands of years, and that for the majority of that, sex meant that a couple engaging in it stood a decently strong chance of making babies. Those babies have to be supported, and since the girl or woman bears the child, the woman and very likely her family may end up shouldering the burden of the baby if she chooses to have sex with someone that is not able to support the baby, or he may be able to provide support, but not as much support as if she had chosen someone that is more successful, so her quality of life and the baby's quality of life may get worse. On the converse, if a boy or man impregnates a girl or woman that struggles to take care of her basic life responsibilities then he may end up in the unenviable situation of having to support both her and his child, and if she's really dysfunctional, while she herself is actively making it harder. Parents with adolescent or adult offspring want their kids to do the best for themselves that they can. Parents have already themselves been through a lot and from experience believe that they can tell when a potential mate for their kids is a good one or not, and they do not want to either end up supporting a grandchild or to end up with their kids' situations getting worse because of sex. In short, it's the possible results from sex that dictate why society has the rules it does on sex and sexual desire and partnering-up."}]}

Their eyes have been fine their whole lives, but normal age-related changes to their eyes, for example, the small muscles that change the shape of their lens to see objects close up, change or fail. So they can still basically see 'fine' more or less over very large distances. They can see a police officer half a mile down the highway, and they can read writing on a chalkboard in a classroom. It's just when they read or look at things close up, their eyes cannot \"accommodate\" so they have to throw on glasses that do the work their eye muscles used to do. People (like me) that have to wear glasses all the time have problems in a bunch of different ways. The shape of our eyes can be fouled up, e.g. oval instead of round, or the lenses in our eyes can be focusing the light on the wrong part of the back of our eyes, plus many more ways... Another way of looking at it is, people that need reading glasses need help controlling their eyes over like 12-15 inches, or however far you hold a book from your face, whereas people who are able to see near objects, but not far away, need help controlling their eyes over distances of between one foot, and like twenty feet. ------ Old people with reading glasses have eyes that fail in one very specific way that affects their vision over a short range of distances. Young people who wear glasses all day everyday have eyes that fail either in one specific way that affects their vision over long distances, or in many ways that affect their vision over long distances"}]}

No, but seriously, I grew up in a very religious family. I hated it every step of the way, it was forced on me, and when I finally told my parents how I felt about it all they damn near disowned me and still look at me as less of a person. My personal bias aside, maybe you shouldn't crank it all day every day. But maybe it's not bad to crank it every once in a while. Me, personally, I won't masturbate for a week, maybe two. I just don't want to. I get busy and it never crosses my mind, or I'm tired, or whatever. But every once in a while, maybe once or twice a month, on one of my off days I'll crank it throughout the day, maybe 10, 20 times in a day. Just to get it out of my system, \"clean out the pipes\" as it were. Sometimes I even break out the gigantic dildo and get freaky deaky in the shower for an hour or two. Is it bad? Well, sometimes I get chafed and I'm usually pretty exhausted afterwards. But I don't do it every day, or even most days. I just set aside a day or two out of the month to have an all-day fapathon. I really think the biggest reason the church isn't very fond of masturbation is because it's so much easier, and usually more gratifying, than sex. Or it becomes that way when you haven't had sex in a long time or haven't been in a relationship. Whoever circumsized me when I was a kid (Oh, hey, thanks for that one too religion - paragons of good and humanity, but only if you let us snip your dick when you're an infant) didn't do such a great job. Everything looks fine, and it's the right size and everything. But I have shit for sensitivity. Every time I have sex, even after not jackin' it for almost two weeks, it either takes me so long to get off that the girl gets exhausted, sore, or bored, or I can't get off at all. Even when I do crank it, it takes me almost 20 minutes to even get close. It's all just about controlling people. If you think it's bad to masturbate, then you'll seek out sex to sate that urge. Just go around knocking people up, since your sperm is so important you can't even spill it on the ground. Hypocritical, two-faced, holier than thou control freaks. Get mad, ban me, whatever. I don't care. You're all terrible people in some way, you just pray to the magical sky man and that suddenly makes everything all better."}]}
{"id": "3lc843", "input": "Why do we have 'at will employment' in US? Why don't we protect worker's jobs by preventing employees firing them without any fault ?", "output": [{"answer": "There are pros and cons to the US approach and those of other countries which you mention. I'll give you my experience of the other countries (so not At Will) as I used to interview, hire, and if necessary look into firing, employees for a company in the UK. As to why you don't have it in the US, it's just that it's a different balance: One of the advantages of the UK system is stability. When I hired someone I knew they would not disappear from one day to the next. The month notice period (which is standard but can vary, and generally goes up with how much responsibility you have) means that from hearing that a worker is leaving it gave me a month to find replacements, make any adjustments and even do a handover with the new starter if necessary. For the employee it meant that they had the security of knowing they would not be out on the street from one day to the next, that they had at least a month's worth of work from being told they were fired/made redundant. The negative of this notice period is that as a worker it's sometimes hard to move into another job if they need someone else straight away or starting shorter than your notice period, because you are contractually obliged to stick out your period. Some people just leave anyway and depending on the position the company might just write it off (obviously they don't pay them). Keep in mind that if your new employer finds out they may not look favourably on this at all as they'll perceive you as being unreliable. It's a misconception you can't fire someone, it's just that you have to follow a process. If someone starts a permanent position then both parties are agreeing to work with each other under the agreed terms of the contract. X amount of hours with Y responsibilities etc. Generally you have annual reviews, where goals are agreed on by both parties and then reviewed at the end of the year. This sets a framework for when you can or can't fire someone, and generally lets both sides know where they stand. If I wanted to fire someone I would have to follow a specific process which generally involved identifying areas where the employee is not meeting the agreed standards, making that employee aware of the faults, giving them a reasonable chance to correct them, and then going from there. That said, this is for general performance. All contracts will have \"Gross Misconduct\" items that are instantly sackable. These are generally stated in the contract itself, and include things that you would expect like theft or any other crimes but may also include other company specific reasons. These reasons have to meet employment law standards so for example you can't have \"dating a black person\" as a gross misconduct item. One of the major benefits for the workers in the above is that you shouldn't (I say shouldn't because things don't always work out like this) ever have a situation where your boss can threaten people with getting sacked. Your boss can't come in having a bad day and say something like \"next person to piss me off is getting fired\". You'd get sued into oblivion. One thing that I personally noticed, and this is now anecdotal, is that it was more common in the US offices to hear threats of \"someone's going to lose their job over this\". Bosses don't, at least in theory, have that ability to hold your job over your head like that. Either someone is committing a fireable offence or they are not, it's not at the whim of someone having a bad day or with a bad temper. In addition to the above, companies can of course make people redundant. This addresses the issue some have brought up about a company having a right downsize when necessary. The thing is you don't generally make people redundant, you make positions redundant. You can't make your Assistant Art Director redundant and then just hire another one when he's out the door, you have to kill that position entirely since your justification for the redundancy should be \"we can't afford/no longer need that position\". There are more granular rules on this that I don't want to state as fact without being sure, but there are time periods that have to go by for example. There are also mechanisms in place to ensure that things are being done fairly and not in a manner that breaks employment law. One thing to really take away is that it's not just as simple as the government forcing companies to keep people on. It's a complicated framework with mechanisms that protect both sides. If a company is finding it hard to fire someone then it can be their fault for the way they drafted their original contract or how they followed the process. I've had to go through the process of someone being dismissed and really it amounts to being able to say: \"This is what we agreed you would do. These are results showing you are not able or willing to meet these standards. Here are the things I've done as an employer to help you achieve these standards (this is so that you can't place unachievable goals on someone and use that to fire them), here are results showing you still cannot meet standards. You're sacked\". All the above happens internally with no government involvement at all. If the employee disagrees and takes you to court, that's where the paper trail you created kicks into gear. And why is it like this? Because culturally that is what the people of the UK, in general, expect and demand. Both as employers and employees. It's similar to how we have strong firearm laws in the UK yet nobody is protesting, because that's how the people there want it. Personally I much prefer the system I was under in the UK. I had friends from the company move to the US and even had the chance to go, and turned it down because I do not feel the US system provides the sort of work environment I would want to work under. I understand why culturally Americans may prefer it, at least the employers, but it's not for me. Really it's like that for most people in the UK, and government policy reflects that. Personally I think that if Americans as a whole do not want government getting in the way of this then government is clearly not reflecting what Americans want. Don't get me wrong, this obviously happens to some degree in the UK too, but maybe because it's a much more homogenous culture and smaller population then it kind of works there. It's a bit like how companies can leverage their power to get things they want, the people of the UK also have power and they choose to exercise it by having a system that works for them (since the majority of UK citizens are employees and not employers). I'm sure many companies in the UK would prefer the US system, but trying to do that in the UK would be political suicide for those in power. The above is written late at night and extremely simplified. I had a HR department that dealt with the finer details so it's possible I got some details wrong or that is just doesn't apply for all circumstances (well, I know it doesn't as the laws vary according to many factors). Hopefully others can correct/add to what I said. TL;DR - Most people in the UK are employees and so they leverage what influence they have into having a system that is far fairer to the working person. This has been culturally accepted for so long that changing the paradigm would be quite hard. Who the hell would want less rights and security? Equally companies pull the other way. In the UK it's fairly levelled between employee and employer. The US system seems to favour employers, which might make sense if you have a high number of small business or people aspiring to own a small business. Also culturally it seems people (US employees and employers) don't feel the government represents what they want, so they try and keep them out of things. In the UK, with employment law at least, it's not like that. That's why we (and in general in Europe) have far better holidays and work conditions. Oh and I totally left out European laws that also come into play, but you should be able to get the gist. Why isn't your system like that in the US? Because either your government is not reflecting what workers want, or that is what workers want."}]}
{"id": "5w0c1o", "input": "Why do websites make you have a complicated password when most account breaches come from a hack and not just guessing?", "output": [{"answer": "most hacks involve guessing. Ok so breakdown on how passwords are stored: If whoever is storing the password for your account isn't a toolbag, they don't ever actually store your password. Instead they feed your password to a hash function and then store what that outputs, and then whenever you input your password, they just feed it back through the function again and check to see if it matches what they have stored. May need to explain what a hash function is so let's detour for a minute. A hash function will take some input of any length and it will output something of a fixed length (usually quite long), the input should always map to exactly the same output ever time and it should do so in a way that's quite easy to do, but very very very hard to undo. For example: using the md5 hash (which isn't one that should ever be used for storing passwords) feeding it \"password\" outputs 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99, \"password1235483\" outputs c048f211d0c6e9dcd83316b042a6723c and and mashing on my keyboard for a hundered chracters or so produces bae019d234e18408edd8b82c9437fecf So this means that if a site is compromised and someone makes off with whatever database they're storing the hashed passwords in, they'd stuck trying figure out what the hell the hashed passwords are. In general this is accomplished via a lookup table which looks kinda like this 286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4=password 10b222970537b97919db36ec757370d2=password1 7576f3a00f6de47b0c72c5baf2d505b0=password123 f2c93f0625019e5461379cd1a4ed1b16=p455w0rd and so on. Then you compare the hashed passwords that were stolen with the known ones and see what matches. Infact because computers are good at what they do, you can just find the hash for basically every combination of characters under a certain size. there's only a few billion passwords with 6 characters or fewer, and it would not take a computer very long to build a database of the hashes for every single one of those passwords. And it also doesn't take a computer very long to check the a bunch of stolen passwords against that list. If you have a weak password, they're going to find it real quick. If you've something much longer and more complex, then it's probably not sitting in some lookup table. Infact, hashing in general isn't the only thing that happens to a password. Instead what they really really should be doing is a salt+hash method. which means instead of feeding just your password to the hash function, they feed it and some other randomly generated \"password\" (the salt) to it. In a simple case this could be something like yourpassword64sdf55c4c1w34372654263r4236r623r23r423564415... where yourpassword is what it says it is and then the random stuff afterwards is the salt. Done right this has two advantages. The first is if two people use the same password there will be different salts used and so the hashed passwords will be different. The second is that it makes lookup tables much less useful, and forces anyone wanting to figure the password out to fall back on brute force guessing. And while a weak password is a little better off in this case, it still won't take very long for a computer to run through a bunch of really common passwords and eventually find yours."}]}

P.S- Fun fact about the Boeing 747-400, it has 4 massive engines on it (2 per wing), but they can still fly with only a single engine. Obviously however if malfunctions occur, they will land for maintenance if possible. Most 747-400's are International flights, so it tends to be over water or up towards the northern hemisphere to cut flying time. Fun Fact #2- The wings are held on by i believe two SERIOUSLY strong bolts (or four? correct me if I'm wrong, someone?) And the wings themselves actually hold gas in them, similar to a gas bladder in the Air Force. It really is impressive engineering in these planes. And some of the older models (727, 737, 757, etc) are still in commission that are probably older then many reading this post."}]}

In nature there's usually no reason for your eyes to see violent motion that is not being also perceived by your ears (or vice versa) so your body will decide that it is being poisoned (eg: the \"spins\" when you've borderline poisoned yourself with alcohol). The body's only real remedy for poison is to purge so you get nauseous then, if that doesn't solve the problem by making you stop making yourself dizzy, throw up. If you find yourself getting seasick or carsick watch the horizon like it's the most exciting thing ever. Since the horizon is not moving, focusing all your attention on it will make your eyes and ears agree. It also helps to look forward since we're used to looking forward so looking backward or sideways still has things (especially close things) tilting and moving the wrong way for what your balance expects. With video games, you can move farther from the screen or use a smaller screen so that the stationary room provides a frame that anchors you visual perception of motion. source: a sailor prone to seasickness and a gamer prone to gamesickness. The driver has the advantage that they are looking forward with the best view and all of their attention is focused on the farthest things they can see."}]}

Hope it makes sense. I can't comment on the origin, but I might be able to explain the sigma. It comes in two parts, though with some overlap: - a child that has become an adult is expected to be self-sufficient, so staying at home is seen as putting an extra burden on the parents to continue taking care of the child. - living at home is cheaper, and living at home after an adult might mean your career is less successful than average. In the mildest form, the child could be a student that graduated at a low point in the economy and has to live with their parents again while looking for work. In the worse case, the child never went to school, isn't looking for a job, and isn't contributing back to the household. Part of it is also the notion that independence makes for a stronger person. Encouraging a child to leave is seen as encouraging them to be more adventurous, more willing to take risks, more likely to find a path in life that's right for them. Having a child that is too dependant on a parent is seen as holding them back. And if the child takes a risk a fails pretty bad, then it's expected that the parents takes them back into the home while they regroup and recover and leave again. Note also that a child living with a parent specifically in order to take of that parent is not only free of the sigma but is seen as virtuous. It's not uncommon for an elderly parent to move back into a house with the cold, and in this casethe burden is assumed to be reversed, where the child is taking on an added burden to take care of the parent."}]}

{"id": "335ota", "input": "why don't the parts of our skin that are always touching, like our toes, get contact sores?", "output": [{"answer": "Simply being in contact isn't enough to cause a pressure sore. The force of the pressure on the skin is a much larger factor in determining whether or not a sore develops. Pressure sores typically form over bony prominences in your body (think of your knuckles or tailbone) and are caused by prolonged periods of pressure on the skin. For example, the act of sitting places you at risk of developing a pressure sore on your tush due to the weight of your upper body pressing down on the skin and reducing the blood flow to the skin and tissue, leading to tissue damage or death (depending on the weight and the length of time). To increase the likelihood of developing a sore, you could increase the weight (force) pressing down, increase the time, or decrease the surface area supporting the weight. If you were to press your toes together tightly for a great length of time, then they might be a small risk of developing a pressure sore, but even then the amount of force (in this case, weight) that would be pressing on the skin is probably unlikely to do any damage."}]}
{"id": "5ixkgu", "input": "What factors into the quantity of ejaculate during orgasm?", "output": [{"answer": "At least for livestock it is determined a lot by the frequency of ejaculation, the age of the animal, and the techniques used to collect semen (basically the psychological/physiological stimulation). I've collected bull and boar semen and assisted with collection of stallions and rams. I'll use bulls for example. Yearling bulls produce much less ejaculate than a four or five year old bull, which is why you wouldn't leave a young bull responsible for breeding more than twenty cows out in the field. When collecting bulls artificially, you could collect using electroejaculation (using a probe to electrically stimulate the prostate), or you could let him mount a cow/dummy and collect it in a sleeve or condom. No bull on the planet likes the electroejaculation, and this method is almost exclusively used to put semen under a microscope to inspect semen and confirm that the sperm are all normal. Why is it only used to test semen quality? Because so little volume in ejaculated when using this method. Now when you get into real bull collections, where companies buy $100k bulls and collect semen from each animal twice a week- volume is important. More volume = more money. For bulls, stallions, and boars (Artificial insemination and semen collection is very rare in rams and the sheep world) - it's very common to find companies that take important notes about each individual male's preferences. Some get special handlers they like. Some have a specific dummy, or a custom-made artificial vagina. Many of these animals get into a routine that they like and, just like humans, each animal needs just the right stimulation to ejaculate. Getting their preferences right results in the largest and most high quality ejaculate. This is why collector's invest so much time and money into recording what each animal likes. So at least in the animals world, most mammals' ejaculate is determined by age, frequency of ejaculation, and tastes/preferences. I think it would be safe to assume some of these translate over to humans."}]}

Each news site, whether left, right, or center, has its own spin. Whether it's because the owner wants to push a certain viewpoint, or the viewers want a certain news type of news, etc. News in the US is business - so they have owners or shareholders that have a vested interest in getting more viewers/advertisers etc. And that means you have to actively appeal to a certain viewerbase to try to win their loyalty, by coming off as \"their\" news source. So you have news that will tailor what and how it reports to certain biases. Sometimes it's not a huge deal, it might just be omitting a small story or focusing on some event at the expense of another, but during elections or high profile cases it really starts to come out. Even ignoring the Clinton/Trump race, even when it was the primaries with Clinton/Sanders, the media tended to focus much more on Clinton, largely \"assuming\" she was going to be candidate, rather than give both equal coverage. And, unfortunately, because of how busy and how much of a barrage of information there is, some people will take what they see as read and just move on with their day. \"I saw it on the news\" has gone from something legitimate to a phrase with a lot less meaning, because now the news sources are much more biased. Everyone of every direction is guilty of it, of pushing some narrative or commentary on a story, rather than just reporting the story itself. Because of so many 24/7 news sites and sources, they have to move beyond just reporting the news, they have to report stories about what they're reporting on. So what should be a five minute segment about some small incident becomes hours-long coverage with views from pundits or callers, or opinions from \"experts\" that lean towards what they want to tell. It's why many stories add on some extra comments - instead of \"X happened at Y,\" it becomes \"X happened at Y, what does this mean for Z?\" And it's that last part that becomes the focus, rather than the event."}]}
{"id": "vxicr", "input": "Scientology. I know next to nothing about it and would like to learn", "output": [{"answer": "Coming from a Scientologist family myself, I will try to explain my understanding of the beliefs in a non-biased manner. I do not have a perfect grasp on it, as I do not practice it myself (I'm Agnostic, and my parents know you can't force something like religion on someone who doesn't want it). I'll say this up front: I do not know it the Xenu is true or not. I've never heard the name Xenu it mentioned in my house or any times I have been dragged along to the local Mission. From my own viewpoint, it doesn't seem to fit in with what I've seen of the group, but it could be that it's kept for higher-ups. Now, a quick disclaimer: I have never done any of the religious Scientology courses, such as Dianetics. I have, however, been shown the movie a couple of times in the past, so I will summarize the beliefs to my understanding. There may be information missing, or some things I have misunderstood. I do not represent Scientology in any way. Now, let's get onto it. I'll begin by explaining some terminology I know. Scientologists believe in the Thetan, which is comparable to a soul. It's the \"essence\" of the person (more or less the personality, from what I can gather), not having to do with the body or anything else physical. Scientologists believe that the mind is split into two parts: The Analytical Mind, and the Reactive mind. The Analytical Mind, as you might have guessed, is more or less conscious thought. It's what you would use to read this post, or do a simple mathematics problem. The Reactive Mind, however, is more along the lines of instinct and thoughts and feelings you do not have control over. An important thing to take note of is that they believe that the mind is ALWAYS recording what is going on, even if one is unconscious. (Ironically, it's my observation that the idea of the Reactive Mind is almost identical to Freud's theory of the Unconscious Mind, which most Scientologists I know eschew.) One thing you will hear about when talking about Scientology are the Dynamics. They are \"urges towards survival\" though many different mediums. The first Dynamic, for example, is through yourself. Cleaning yourself, feeding yourself and getting yourself better when you're sick are all examples of surviving through your First Dynamic. These Dynamics expand outwards from yourself (think of concentric circles, with the First Dynamic at the heart), moving to survival through your family and reproduction, to survival though groups (such as your basketball team), to mankind as a whole. From there the dynamics begin to cover more broad areas, such as all living things, all physical matter (called MEST, Matter Energy Space and Time), spirits, and the Supreme Being (or whatever you want to call it, also known as the Infinity Dynamic). Now, it is Scientology belief that people are all basically good. They want to do good acts and survive with their fellow beings along all eight Dynamics. The reason this doesn't happen, however, is because of aberrations in their nature called Engrams. Engrams are caused when some form of traumatic experience happens to a person, such as getting sick, getting hurt, or other such phenomenon. Engrams can frequently be made when one becomes unconscious. Engrams cause people to act in weird, irrational ways. For example, let's say a person became sick by eating a hard-boiled egg that had gone bad. From then on, he would have an Engram stemming from that event, and become sick when confronted with another hard-boiled egg, whether or not he remembers that original sickness. This is where auditing comes in. Now, I have never been audited, but I will do my best to explain what the end result is. The goal of auditing is to become \"Clear\", or to get rid of all engrams from your current life, including ones that happened while you were in the womb (called pre-natal engrams. I have my own personal criticisms towards this theory, but I'll keep them in check. They are explained by your Reactive Mind recording the sounds and sensations outside the womb, which your mind can figure out when it becomes more developed.). There are different courses in different areas after you become Clear, but I know little of them, outside the fact that you eventually do auditing for engrams outside this life. I could tell a bit more about some nomenclature that they have, but I feel like that's a basic understanding of Dianetics and their basic beliefs. I would be happy to tell about my own experiences with Scientologists, and the Study Technology they use, as well as any other questions you may have. Edit: TL;DR: Basics of Dianetics, Auditing, and other beliefs that I can't explain in a TL;DR sentence. Go read it if you want to be a bit more informed."}]}

When you are physically addicted to something your body goes into withdrawal and makes the addict sick. That physical withdrawal can vary from unpleasant, to life threatening and it can last days. The mental component is drug seeking behavior. The user wants the drug because it helps them cope or satisfies a need they have. Those cravings and needs are likely still there when they wake up, maybe even more so with the stress of a hospital stay. I'll give you some examples. Cigarettes - They have a mild physical addiction that can cause irritability, headaches, and low energy when quitting. These usually fade in a few days. However the mental addiction can last for months or years. The user is used to fidgeting with their hands, they often smoke during other activities and doing those activities without a cigarette makes them crave them all the more. Being around other smokers, or in situations where one usually smokes like drinking in a bar, makes it very difficult to abstain. Opiates - Very strong physical addiction and dependence. Quitting cold turkey leads to intense nausea, diarrhea, sleep interruptions, headaches, intense feelings of hopelessness and malaise. The opiates caused their bodies to produce less endorphins and 'feel good' brain chemicals. Without the drug, the bodies natural pain killers and chemical rewards are not working properly leading to the person being in a lot of pain and discomfort, and things that normally bring joy like friends, food, favorite music and movies, provide little to no relief. This usually fades in several days. The mental aspects of it can last the rest of a persons life. The problems and behaviors that led them to abuse the drug in the first place are often still there when they quit, and recovery can be very difficult and require years of careful control over their behaviors and lives."}]}

At night, it might be that one auditor I mentioned earlier attempting CPR on your 8-year-old. 3) People get drunk at night. Drunk people love to do stupid shit in pools and treat fitness centers like playgrounds. 4) Nighttime is when our graveyard shift housekeepers clean the pool and pool area, wipe down and disinfect the exercise equipment, replace towels, add chemicals and do maintenance on pumps and other hardware. 5) Shutting off the jets in the hot tub, the lights in these areas, and the running of water from showers, sinks, fountains, etc. saves the hotel money at times when guest traffic doesn't warrant the expense of keeping the area running. 6) People splashing around in the pool or loudly clanging free weights back onto the racks disturbs other guests who are trying to sleep. 7) We secretly hate all of you and it puts a faint twinkle in our eye when we get to tell you you can't have what you want the second you want it."}]}

And for some products, it's not economical to build such a machine because it will never pay for itself. Humans may not be very precise, but we're very flexible. You train a person to do a job, and they can generalise those skills to do a vast number of similar jobs. For this reason, lots of things are hand-assembled even if they aren't \"handmade\". At the moment, it's cheaper to hand assemble an iPhone in China than it is to design and build a robot factory to do the same job. Also consider that new models are introduced annually, so your machine either needs to be as adaptable as a human or you're going to be building a new factory every year. As noted by other posters, this is particularly evident for limited-run or bespoke items, where a machine would have to save a lot of money per item to make it worth building in the first place. In other cases, it's because a human really can do a better job. Take fashion. It's possible to make a shirt which is entirely machine-stitched (ie. where no human needed to pick up a needle). But certain details are better when done by hand. A machine can easily lay down a perfectly even stitch, but that doesn't make it the best way to sew on a sleeve. A human tailor can adjust the tension stitch by stitch to make everything sit perfectly. It's impractical to give a machine the sensory and manipulatory apparatus to replicate the feat. Of course, in the case of some premium goods, it doesn't need to be \"better\". It just needs to be marketed as better."}]}

The pulp or nerve/vascular part of the tooth, can laid down tissue in a limited capacity. The pulp contains odontoblast cells, which, in certain instances can insulate themselves from dentin that has been invaded by bacteria. Pulp capping is a procedure that can be done when a deep filling is placed and there is a slight amount of hard, but decayed dentin remaining near the pulp, or in some cases when then pulp is breached. This procedure relies on the reparative abilities of the tooth. This procedure works much better in young people due to the fact that there are SCAP cell or stem-cells of the apical papilla located at the apex of the tooth contiguous with the pulp, which can differentiate and help with healing a tissue deposition. These degrade as you age, which is why pulp capping does not work as well as you age. the tip portion of the root will lose its stem cells and will \"close.\" Also the adult pulp has been seen to have less of a vascular components and less Mesenchymal stem cells, which will also contribute to poor healing of said tissues. The dentin of the tooth has very limited reparative ability, more of a protective response really. Dentin has a cellular component and can respond to bacterial invasion. In many folks tertiary dentin is formed when bacteria draw near to odontoblast cells. I have many times drilled out decayed tooth structure to find stained dentin near the pulp. This dentin is very hard and not Carious, and therefore will not be removed. This was the body's response to the decay, or the protective response of the cells in the dentin. Enamel has NO capacity to heal strictly speaking. You are able to \"remineralize\" small area do decalcification. This is similar to placing a rock in a saturated solution of some compound and having with compound precipitate onto the rock. Outright cavitation require intervention, removal of bacteria, and subsequent replacement with filling material. I have not seen great clinical evidence, studies, or results with trying to remineralize tooth structure. I have seen some evidence and some results, but nothing that really makes me think we shouldn't do filling on heavily demineralized enamel. In summary pulp can heal, dentin can protect itself to a degree and enamel can only be remineralized. This in no way is meant to be a comprehensive explanation of the disease process of teeth, or the healing of such, but to give you insight into the \"healing\" or reparative capacities of human adult teeth.

{"id": "5n8k81", "input": "CRISPR and how it'll 'change everything'", "output": [{"answer": "Geneticist here! CRISPR (or CRISPR-Cas9, if you want the full name), is a big improvement in how we genetically modify organisms. All organisms, from single-cell bacteria, to plants, to animals, to humans, have long molecules inside of them, called DNA. The pattern of different molecules in this chain of DNA, called the *genetic code,* provides instructions for building those bacteria/plants/animals. Tiny little machines inside those cells read the genetic code and use those instructions to make every part of the organism, so that it can grow and reproduce! Now, one of the really cool things about DNA is that, because it's the \"blueprint\" for making an organism, we can make changes to the DNA and see the results in the resulting organisms! For example, if we insert the instructions for producing a green fluorescent protein (called GFP for short) in a bacteria's DNA, that bacteria will make the protein, and will glow green under fluorescent light! Unfortunately, inserting a new chunk of instructions into DNA isn't as easy as making a change to a set of blueprints. We can manipulate DNA when it's isolated from an animal, on its own, but there's no way to build a new organism around that naked DNA. If we want to change an organism, we need to get at the DNA inside the cells, without killing them. In addition, cells don't like getting random chunks of DNA shoved at them. They see this as a threat, and will destroy that DNA. So in order to get a chunk of DNA to stay in a cell, we need to incorporate it into the cell's own DNA - merge it in, like glueing a new sheet into the blueprints. In order to add a chunk of foreign DNA, we need to add our chunk inside the cell, break the cell's own DNA somewhere, and then get the cell to fix its DNA by sticking our inserted chunk into the gap. Three tasks. **Task 1:** getting the foreign chunk of DNA into a cell, can be accomplished by using electricity or soap to temporarily \"pop\" the cell's membrane. Obviously, this doesn't work well on adult humans, but it works great on bacteria and single cells. **Task 2:** Breaking the cell's DNA somewhere. This is the really tricky part. Using certain (very nasty and dangerous) chemicals can make the DNA break in random places, but this is dangerous; what if we break the DNA in the middle of a gene that we need? Our cells will die! This is where CRISPR comes in. CRISPR is a combination of a scissor-like protein and a DNA guide that lets it only cut at very specific chosen locations. Unlike old methods, we can be very precise with where we cut the cell's own DNA. We can cut to turn off a gene, or cut at a place where there's nothing but junk so that we can insert our own foreign DNA pieces! **Task 3:** Close the DNA back up, fixing those cuts - with our inserted chunk inside. Fortunately, cells have the machinery to repair DNA cuts on their own! That was easy! ****** **So, CRISPR is a molecular pair of scissors that cuts DNA in very precise locations.** There are still big challenges with genetic engineering - it's tough to get these scissors into a cell, the foreign chunk of DNA doesn't always get inserted, and the CRISPR scissors can still miss and cut in the wrong places. But this is a huge advancement in making more precise cuts, a very important part in creating an organism with new abilities. Feel free to ask questions!"}]}

If the modern day engineers built a bridge for modern day use, but all you got were foot traffic, horse buggies, or the occasional army-on-horseback riding through, I'd bet those bridges will stand for several millennia. It's unfair to compare your concrete driveway to bridges, though, since the thickness of the concrete comes into play. Most slabs for residential driveways and garages only go about 4 to 6 inches deep, and are not uniform across the entire surface. If you've ever noticed, the contractors rarely use anything more than a 2x6 to create the edges of your driveway. Assuming the depth is universal (99.99% of the time it isn't) then you'd have a 6\" slab all the way around. Not bad, but still prone to breaking under its own weight as the ground shifts. On the other hand, if you've ever seen them pour concrete for roadways or bridges, it is rebar-reinforced and poured several feet thick. TL:DR (ELI5); don't compare your 4\" driveway slab made to park one or two small cars to a bridge designed to safely carry heavy volume."}]}

Comcast, Time Warner, and other cable companies operate through franchise agreements they have with cities. Essentially, cities (and other local governments) gave them (often exclusive) rights to tear up streets, use utility poles, and do other things necessary for providing service. After the cable companies got their cable networks built out, they lobbied heavily for tight regulation on new companies seeking to build out networks. That corruption makes it hard for new broadband companies to enter existing markets. So what Google did was this: they let cities *compete* to attract Google Fiber. So far, Austin, Kansas City, and Provo, Utah have \"won\" with offers that include relaxing rules that gave Comcast and Time Warner monopolies. But in most markets, you only have one choice because Comcast and Time Warner are in bed with corrupt regulators and city officials. It isn't a matter of Google fiber, either: anyone could compete against the cable companies, if it weren't for political corruption."}]}

Starting from that you have \"fashion\", which is responsible for all kinds of odd behaviour you cannot explain. As soon as you have a society where you show that you do not have to spend your day working for life but have time for other things (you are \"rich\" or \"noble\" or whatever it is in the current society called) tending after your body (muscles, cleanlyness, clothing and of course hair, makeup, ..., and beard) becomes a thing you can do to \"show off\" and what you can \"afford\". Again, fashion does hit and also embraces beards. There are many signs of a higher social status, as brighter skin (not working outside all day), soft hands (not working at all), fancy clothing, fancy hair, etc... beards (in general or the lack of one) are just part of that. The above is also true for soldiers etc, as others have stated. Discipline is, even in modern armies, tied to how soldiers tend to their body. That is first true to keep up the fighting ability, but also discipline and self-image. I read a theory that the modern view on \"super clean shaven\" of the modern man started both with the industrialised cheap razor, so everyone could afford it, as well as with the first World War, where people liked to be *very* cleanly shaven so the gas mask would sit as tight as possible."}]}

{"id": "351wv4", "input": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "output": [{"answer": "Wait. Before you go down this path, what do you mean \"If they were severely inebriated and they have sex then [...] they [...] are ultimately not at fault\" Of course they are at fault. If you get drunk and then rape someone, you are still at fault for raping a person. The difference is consent versus responsibility. If you are intoxicated, then you are not making good decisions. In a state that you're not making good decisions, certain things aren't allowed. In general, when you're not of sound mind, a contract that you enter into may be voidable. Consent for sex is essentially a contract. It's saying \"I give you permission to touch me in ways that I'm normally protected by law against.\" The problem is, if a person is intoxicated, that permission can be found void, because the person wasn't thinking properly. On the other hand, when you drink and drive there's no parallel. With sex, you have the ability to grant permission to other people to have sex with you, you are by default protected from people touching you inappropriately without your permission. If you're intoxicated, it's possible that you wouldn't reasonably give permission, but weren't of sound mind. With driving drunk, you have no permission to drive on the road drunk. There's nothing about being drunk that gives you the protected right to drive on the road drunk. There's nothing about being drunk that gives you special rights in sex either. The only thing that being drunk can do is protect you from giving away the protections by the law unintentionally. The law protects you from being touched sexually, drunk or sober. You can grant permission, but if you're unable to make decisions, that permission might not count. People can have sex with you only if they have permission, and if that permission doesn't count, they have hurt you. It's a bit of a minefield to have a one-night stand with someone who is drunk. You don't know if they are really giving consent, or if they are not. You won't find out until they're sober. If you don't know, then you don't do it. On the other hand, in a long term relationship, it's probably not such a big deal. You know the relationship, you know the person, you know what they're comfortable with, you know what's expected. If you have had sex every night for the past year and get drunk and eagerly have sex together one night, it might be OK. But even then, you don't know for certain. Without being in the situation it's impossible to tell whether it's reasonable. But you don't get special protection from being drunk. You just don't have the ability to be trusted to enter into contracts. Since there's no contract involved in drunk driving, nothing changes."}]}

Help me", "output": [{"answer": "I think most people are misinterpreting your wife's statement and missing an important point  >  there's 'more depth water to make it float' *To everyone commenting:* She's not saying the water is too shallow to float it because the egg will rest on the bottom, she's thinking the extra depth of water gives the water extra ability to float objects. Her bath example is wrong because she's touching the bottom (I'd be impressed if someone can float in a pool without going deeper than a bathtub), but that's not the misconception that's throwing her off. *To OP:* She's not entirely wrong to think depth of water changes some characteristics of the water, but her logic is upside down. The water at the **bottom** of the glass is affected by the weight of the water above it (because of gravity) but the water at the **top** of the glass is not affected by any water underneath it. There's no force that propagates up from the bottom and is increased by additional water depth to make the water more able to float an egg. **It's like if you stack up 5 bricks - the bottom brick is feeling the weight of all 4 bricks above it but the top brick doesn't feel the weight of the 4 bricks below it.** *(edit for emphasis because this is the nutshell of it)* *A few more words* As water gets deeper, it does get denser - the pressure increases from all the water above a certain point. However, water's not very compressible so the density doesn't change much (because \"more dense\" means you've squeezed the same number of molecules into a smaller space). So if you drop an object *ever so slightly* denser than water it into a very deep well, eventually it will stop sinking because the density of the water below it is higher than the density of the object. So now it's floating because the water is deep (and dense) enough. But like I said water will compress a minimal amount so your object's density has to be just a hair's edge more than water's for this to work. Counter intuitively, this increased pressure only depends on the depth of the water and not on the volume. If you have a tube 1 cm in diameter and 10 m long filled with water, you can measure the same pressure at the bottom of the tube as you would if it were a culvert 1 m in diameter of the same height."}]}

Suppressors DO NOT MAKE GUNS SILENT. They still have a seriously loud report, especially with rifles since the majority of the rounds are super sonic. Super sonic rounds are in no way quieted by suppressors. Handguns can be subsonic and they will come down to 120 db minimums. That's not quiet. But it won't cause hearing damage. I do not want to have to cause myself hearing damage or my children's hearing damage to protect them from an intruder. Stop conflating suppressors with the ability to shoot without anyone noticing the shooting. Suppressors do not silence anything. That is a myth. 120 db is a thunder clap or an auto horn. Suppressors bring weapons down to the point of not causing hearing damage. This is a safe tool to have. And 120 db is the lowest a suppressor can get. More common average is more like 125-130 which is a jet taking off. In many countries is even considered rude to not shoot with a suppressor because it is simply loud and annoying. Noise pollution avoidance is also helpful and anyone near a shooting range can certainly appreciate the possibility of it being more common that weapons are quieter. This is just a few examples. There are many more. Bring on the downvotes. Furthermore since this is clearly an attempt to chase the political questions that have been pushed forth by recent events. Purchasing a suppressor currently requires a full background check, paying between 1000 and 2000 dollars, and waiting 9-13 months to posses along with vetting by the ATF and local police. The same goes for legal full auto except the weapons cost 20 thousand dollars or more. The recent attacks were carried out by a man who had both the time and money to procure these types of tools and didn't. Evidently legislation has been proven effective enough to keep evil people with the means from owning these things. Stop politicizing the acts of evil people to push an agenda."}]}

I live in Hamilton, which is a city an hour west of Toronto and commute to school in Toronto. I also worked in Toronto for a not-for-profit doing sandwich runs for the homeless, and was present in Toronto during the G20 summit/riots of 2010 and Rob Ford's election. I know a bit about Rob Ford. I remember when he was elected, myself and all my friends were not happy and supportive because his demographic was targeted towards parts of the GTA not connected to the downtown core (which is OKAY! everyone is entitled to their opinion) but this made us nervous because we knew his constituency wouldn't be concerned with problems concerning the marginalized, mainly. While he has served as mayor, he has waged a \"battle\" against cyclists, trying to remove bike lanes, saying that cyclists are a \"pain in the ass to motorists\" (see [here]( URL_1 ) or [here]( URL_0 )) he has also said racists comments about members of city council and people from an Asian demographic (see [here]( URL_3 ) ) he has also used city council letterhead to solicit money from lobbyists to support his football charity foundation. This was the matter referenced in u/doc_daneeka 's comment regarding the \"conflict of interest that was dropped\" (see [here]( URL_2 ) ) The crack scandal is the top of the pile. This scandal caused a tremendous deal of damage to the Somali community of North Toronto (as it became connected to them) and was humiliating for the rest of us in the GTA. What happened was that in May, the news website gawker alleged that they had seen a cellphone video from some drug dealers in Toronto of Rob Ford smoking crack, and were selling the video. The Toronto Star also verified that they were approached with the offer to buy the video, and confirmed they saw it. Gawker used a very public crowd funding campaign to raise the money to buy the video, and were successful at doing so, but the video, and the owners, went into hiding, and gawker, as they promised, donated the money to a number of charities supporting helping people with addictions, and helping members of the Somali community in Toronto. Rob Ford denied the existence of the video, and now the police have found it. Ford's lawyer is now asking police to release the video on the defense that Ford could be smoking \"anything\" - tobacco, marijuana, etc. and that the video can't prove that he's smoking crack. This is unfortunate. He has brought public humiliation to the corner of the world I live in, and he's a horrible mayor that doesn't care about the marginalized, is racist, and doesn't care about taking action to create environmental reform, especially in a city that (believe me!) is a nightmare to drive in, any hour of the day. The only way he can be removed is if he is convicted of a criminal offense. (which I have mixed hopes about, given the lawyer's shoddy defense... however I remain hopeful that the Toronto Police Service have more evidence to offer than one video) Otherwise what will happen is that *hopefully* he'll finally be voted out in the 2014 municipal elections and we can be rid of this nightmare once and for all."}]}

To be honest, I don't think this is fully understood but there ARE some interesting things behind this! First off, Restless Leg Syndrome :  URL_0  Basically, the urge to move your leg is so heavily imprinted to the point that if you aren't moving your leg, your brain causes pain to start urging you to move it. For how it relates to actually having been started I can't be certain it's a genetic advantage (However, I do believe it to be)... Unfortunately there are no studies for it in humans but in goats we have found what was referred to as a beautiful hinney gene, basically a hereditary gene that was causing goats to do this bouncing and would cause them more muscle growth and thus have a nice butt. Unfortunately I can't find the name of the gene which makes it hard to find the study, but I would have loved to link it for everyone. TL;DR : We can't be certain. However, from a genetics standpoint it is an evolutionary advantage towards a nice butt and strong legs. Source : BSc. Molecular Bio and Genetics. Edit : As for the top comment of it being about circulation I do believe that is a possibility, however that seems like a side benefit to me. Your heart is powerful and designed to pump blood all over your body, including upwards. Getting your blood down towards your legs isn't really a problem for it as gravity helps while the heart has evolved to work against gravity. On top of that, moving the leg requires energy output which means it would require more energy (and thus bloodflow) and the activity raises your heart BPM making it a kinda redundant process (it may be overall beneficial but still, there is slight redundancy and evolution likes to stay away from that and find more efficient methods)."}]}

Well Little Jimmy, from my understanding this stems from two reason. The first: You know how the boys in your school like the girls and sometimes you'll do things to try to impress them [part of natural selection]. This happens a lot for boys (and men) and because of that there is a much larger number of males doing these physical activities than there are women (who typically try to impress guys in other ways [like looking healthy with makeup and fertile with bras and hair dye]). Because there are so many more men doing these things there are more people who can be excellent at it, ATribeCalledGreg describes this quite well, and also there is a lot more competition among men which pushes them to perform better. [More reading: * URL_0  * URL_2 ] The second: This one is a lot more controversial and actually describes a situation where men are generally both better AND worse than women at these things. Back when humans just started existing people had to evolve to survive. When humans evolved they didn't just automatically become better, each time a child was born it had a chance to be less good or more good than it's parent. What would happen then is the best children would have more babies with better partners and the less good ones would have less babies (if they got to have babies at all). This would happen over and over again and over time there were more and more better children. If children didn't become less and more good [mutate] this whole thing would not have worked [evolution]. There is a theory that this was more important to men because we are the ones that have to impress women (like we talked about before). What this means is that every time a baby boy is born it has a bigger chance to be better and a bigger chance to be worse but a lower change to be average [standard deviation is higher]. [More reading:  URL_1 ] TL;DR: There are a lot more men doing these sports because of our evolutionary need to impress women through physical activities and the standard deviation for men's performance at most things in life is much larger than that for women (i.e. men tend to be both better and worse than women at most things where women tend to be more average)."}]}

I can just eat that cold.", "output": [{"answer": "The science: Any food that was originally served hot must be cooled properly, then reheated to 165 degrees for at least 2 minutes before serving. The reason for this is because bacteria can grow out of control within a certain time/temperature zone. If food has been discovered to be between 45 and 140 degrees, it is prime for bacteria to thrive. This is the \"Danger Zone\". Generally, any food found to be within this range for a period of approx 4 hours is considered to be hazardous, as the amount of bacteria that will have grown in that time is enough to make you seriously ill. Food cannot be made safer in step B than it was in step A, so following proper heating/cooling procedures the entire time is essential.

If you breathe pure oxygen your entire life will you age quicker than someone who breathes the quality of oxygen we have currently?", "output": [{"answer": "Your edit makes it seem like you understand why breathing pure oxygen at normal pressure would kill you, so I'll skip that part. When people talk about oxygen in the context of aging, they are talking about something called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS.) These are molecules that have oxygen in them that are really unstable. They are each missing an electron, and they snatch it from wherever they can find it. Unfortunately, they often snatch electrons from important molecules like DNA, proteins, and the fats that make up the boundaries of your cells. They can be helpful in some contexts. For example, when your immune system recognizes bacteria and other invaders, your body makes ROS's to destroy them. They keep them protected in a special cover to keep them from damaging your cells. But if they get out, they can do damage to your body. It's kind of like if a machine gun's trigger gets stuck and it starts spraying everywhere. Normally, your body has special chemicals to deactivate them. You can eat foods that are anti-oxidants. But your body is exposed to them all the time, and sometimes they get through. They can cause aging, or worse. If they steal electrons from your DNA, the can cause the DNA to become unstable and mutate, leading to cancer. If you breathe a higher level of oxygen regularly, you will be exposed to more ROS's. Over time, this can cause problems. I'm not sure if I can quantify how much more likely you are to get cancer or age faster, and a lot depends on how many fruits and vegetables you eat and whether you smoke (The ROS's in smoke is a big reason why smokers get lung cancer.)

When my family got cable, it was OnTv in the early 80s, and there were no commercials, only interstitial ads between movies that told you what was coming up next month on OnTv. Other than that, it was wall-to-wall programming. The cable TV became commoditized. There were channels like MTV and ESPN that weren't \"premium\" content, and they were all lumped together in huge packages of channels and sold in one big group. The deal was that as the consumer, instead of paying x dollars per month for just one premium cable channel, you pay a little more but you get like 20 channels (then 40, then 60, etc). All of these \"basic cable\" channels only use the cable company as a delivery mechanism, but they are historically much cheaper than the premium channels like HBO, Cinemax, Starz, Showtime, etc. So they have to generate revenue for the cable company and themselves outside what you pay the cable company. Incidentally, I don't know how old you are but showing ads in movie theaters is a fairly recent thing as well.

{"id": "4aoh2y", "input": "Why can't someone be shocked back to life by a defibrillator like in movies?", "output": [{"answer": "Alright. Down time on night shift. I'll see where we can go with this. When we see someone being shocked \"back to life\" in movies, we are essentially talking about consciousness. We moviegoers think someone is back to life when we see signs of consciousness (i.e. opening eyes, responding to rescuers, demanding for an ice cream). When we see someone \"die\" in movies, we're essentially talking about losing consciousness. This can happen in a few ways. Usually, this is due to lack of blood supply to the brain (people can lose consciousness from a variety of ways, but let's restrict our discussion to cardiac causes since we're talking about defibrillator). We need to think like plumbers. To make it simple, think of the heart as a pump and the brain (consciousness) as a reflection of how good the pump is working. Good flow to brain = conscious; bad flow to brain = unconsciousness. Blood supply to the brain is compromised due to cardiac causes by a few ways: 1. Low blood volume. If blood volume is low, ain't gonna matter how hard the heart pumps. Nothing is going to get up there. 2. Weak pump. Might have good pump with good wiring in a solid 10 body, but if the pump is weak, nothing much will happen. Happens in cases like heart attack where the pump dies. 3. Faulty wiring. For the heart to keep on pumping, we need good electrical wiring to tell the heart when and how fast to pump. Defibrillation only acts to fix the faulty wiring part. It can't do shit about broken pump or low volume. On a good day, the wiring makes the heart pump in a perfect, synchronised fashion. Let's use an analogy: imagine squeezing a tube of toothpaste. To properly empty the tube and get the most out, we squeeze it from the tail end, gradually pushing everything from tail end to the open end. The heart works the same way too, your finger squeezing in a coordinated manner being the synchronised cardiac muscle contracting to empty the heart chambers to squeeze all the blood out. Now problems happen in one of two ways. 1. No electrical signal. This is what we call ASYSTOLE. Flat line on the ECG. This means the heart isn't stimulated, which means no squeezing happens at all. Kinda like leaving an opened tube of toothpaste on the table and stare at it. Nothing happens. In situations like this, the defibrillator doesn't do shit to the heart. Also where most medical professions laughs at TV doctors bringing patients to life by shocking a flatlined patient. This is where CPR (and some drugs/potion) is pretty much the only option to save the patient. 2. Scrambled electrical signal. This is what we call FIBRILLATION. ECG lines become erratic. This makes the heart quivers like a very cold hamster. Kinda like poking lightly at random spots on a toothpaste tube. Doesn't squeeze very well. This is where defibrillator has a chance of working. It works by resetting the scrambled signals. Like how we fix most computer problems; turning it off and on again. It's in the name, deFIBRILLATOR. Get it? Oh, it doesn't always work too. Even if we manage to shock the patient back into normal electrical activity, the pump is sometimes too traumatised from the whole event to pump properly, which will result in problems like a weak pump, which the defibrillator can no longer fit. So you see, there are plenty of reason why someone can lose consciousness and appear \"dead\" on movies, many more which I won't have space/time to explore here. Defibrillator can only fix a small subset from the bigass list of problems. Defibrillator can only work if used at the right time, for the right problem. And even if it does work, bringing a patient back to consciousness or appear \"alive\" heavily depends on post-resuscitation care, which is a topic for another day. TL;DR: defibrillator isn't magic."}]}
{"id": "wfhoa", "input": "What on earth is happening on the floor of the Stock Exchange, exactly?", "output": [{"answer": "\"** Part One : Stocks ** First, let's imagine that down the street there is a toy store. Mr. Jones owns the toy store, and he has owned it for the last ten years. The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr. Jones' toy store. Let's suppose we wanted to buy Mr. Jones' toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead. Would we be able to buy it for a dollar? No, of course not. It is worth a lot more than that. How about ten dollars? A hundred dollars? Well, how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr. Jones' toy store? The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making. If the toy store is making $100 every day, that means it is making roughly $3,000 (30 days of $100) every month, or $36,000 every year (12 months of $3,000). Let's suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years. Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth $360,000 (which is $36,000 for ten years). Now, in practice this is a lot more complicated. But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame. Fortunately, we don't have to figure it out ourselves. There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth, and they do all of the hard work for us. They will tell us just how much Mr. Jones' toy store is really worth, and then we can decide to buy it or not. So, let's consider that the toy store is worth $360,000. If we want to buy it (and if he is willing to sell it), we can pay Mr. Jones that much money and now the toy store is ours! Now, this is all well and good if we have $360,000 and we want to own the entire company. But let's suppose we only have half that much, we have $180,000. What can we do now? Well, as long as Mr. Jones is willing, we can buy half of his company instead of the whole thing. This means that we will own 50% or half of the company, and he will own the other half. That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr. Jones, half will go to him and the other half to us. Another way of saying that we own 50% of the company is to say that we own 50% of the stock in a company. When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it, those pieces are called stock. There are two ways to think about stock: percentages, and shares. What we just talked about are percentages. We can buy 50% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $180,000. Similarly, we could buy 10% of the shares in Mr. Jones' toy company for $36,000 (assuming the total value of the company was $360,000), or we could buy 1% of the shares for $3,600, and so on. When you hear people talk about stocks, you will hear them talk about shares of stock. What exactly does this mean? Well, let's imagine that Mr. Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company. What he can do is say \"Hey everyone, I have 100 different pieces of my company for sale.\" In this example, there are 100 total pieces he has for sale, each one being worth 1% of the stock. To buy all 100 pieces would cost you $360,000 and this would mean you own the entire company. This would mean that whenever the company makes money, you get all of the money. But let's suppose we only have $3,600 to use. This means all we can afford is one piece of his company, but that one piece is worth 1% which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars, we will get one dollar. So in this example, Mr. Jones' looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company, because each piece costs $3,600 which is a lot of money. So he decides rather than just have 100 pieces, or shares, he is going to have a thousand pieces! Now it takes ten shares to have 1% of the company, but each share is only $360. That is a lot more affordable. He could even decide to make 10,000 shares which means that you could buy a share for only $36. So this is the basic concept. Companies cut their value into pieces, or shares, and then sell the shares to people who will buy them. The people who buy shares are called \"investors\" and the act of buying a share is called \"investing\". This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid, because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makes. When a company is enormous, worth billions of dollars, even a thousand shares is simply not enough. They need to have many, many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable. Some companies have millions of shares of stock. Now, we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company. You are able to keep some of the money the company makes, based on how many shares you own. But when you own part of a company, you don't just get some of the money it makes. You also get to make decisions. Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next. The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have. Imagine that a company is owned by three people: Billy, Melissa, and James. Imagine that Billy owns 40% of the total shares, and that Melissa and James each own 30%, which is less than what Billy owns. Let's suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy. Billy thinks it is a good idea, but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea. Well, even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company, and more voting power, he will still be out voted by both Melissa and James. This is because together Melissa and James have 60% compared to Billy's 40%. When a company has a lot of share holders (people who own stock in the company), they will have meetings called shareholder meetings. In these meetings, everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own. The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decides. So then, this brings up a question. What if there are a lot of people who own shares, but one of them owns more than half of all the shares? Would that person be able to out-vote everyone else, no matter how many other people there are? The answer is yes. If a single person owns more than half of all the shares, then they have what is called \"controlling interest\" in the company. This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}]}
{"id": "2htfxs", "input": "How does a coding language get 'coded' in the first place?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm going to start with the hardware and then go on to the languages, so skip to the part you like. HARDWARE: Hardware is based on boolean logic (binary), which was developed by mathematicians quite some time ago. Hardware is essentially a series of binary equations put together using logic gates, made out of transistors. These are put together using specific structures as necessary for the project, sometimes using pre-designed portions. These also include a timer, which is used to synchronize the circuits. For instance, let's assume that your USB port wants to put new data in memory. But, the memory is already talking to another component. The timer helps to let the USB system know to wait its turn. It also prevents some parts of the system from going too quickly, which can lead to different parts of the system screwing each other up. The end result of this process is that you get a device which interprets specific sequences of binary numbers as instructions for the computer. For instance, 0001 might mean 'read memory,' and '0010' might mean 'write memory.' LANGUAGES: However, people don't go around putting in strings of binary numbers very often these days. We have programs to do it for us. These programs are called assemblers. They are designed for specific types of chips, including a coded language to let you \"talk\" to the computer using shorthand. For instance, this little sequence: mov ax,1 mov bx,2 add ax,bx tells the assembler that you want to move the number \"1\" into a register (a special piece of memory used for calculations), move the number \"2\" into another register, and add these two together. The assembler would translate this into the specific binary sequences needed by the processor, saving time. Assembler is a difficult language to work with, though, so we typically use much friendlier languages, such as C, which are written to be much closer to human languages and logic. These languages are based off of concepts of mathematical languages from the early 1900s, from which some early languages, such as FORTRAN, were derived. The actual process of designing or developing the language's structure, however, is a very complicated one, because there are *many* possible pitfalls that you can fall into. For instance, you want everything in the language to be unambiguous, i.e. only one meaning possible. Problem is, you can mathematically prove ambiguity, but you CANNOT prove unambiguity! So you have to be *very* careful, and even then languages do have situations wherein they can become ambiguous. That said, designing a language's structure itself is more of a mathematical exercise than a programming one. Programs written in these languages are translated into working programs by a program called a compiler. Compilers are typically split into two pieces. The first is a front end that processes (or parses) the language itself. Usually it then outputs an analysis of the programming that was input, which is in the form of a tree. This is passed to the back-end, which rewrites the now-tree-ified program in machine code. Trees are used because they tend to be fairly easy structures to work with for the programmer, and are also usually pretty efficient for the machine to use. A compiler is usually put together using steps similar to these: 1. Write a simplified compiler that uses a subset of the desired language. You write it in another language, in assembler, or in very rare cases (almost never done today), enter the numbers directly. Let's say you're writing a C compiler. You could write a simplified C compiler in Pascal or assembly that does not support all the features of the language, just enough to get the compiler working. This compiler would be capable of putting out the numbers needed to form actual usable machine code. 2. You then write a second version of the compiler, using the subset of the language. In other words, you use this \"lesser\" compiler to write the full-up compiler. 3. Once you have the full-up compiler running, the compiler can then use older versions of itself to compile newer versions of itself. In other words, the language is now written in its own language. This process is known as \"boostrapping\" the language for a specific system. It is also possible to build a compiler that outputs machine code for a machine that it is not currently working on, e.g. write a C compiler that runs on Intel's processors that puts out machine code that works on Motorola processors. This is known as a cross-compiler, and since it lets you use existing tools more easily, I'm pretty sure it's used more often than old-style bootstrapping when developing new CPU architectures these days. Hope that helped."}]}

{"id": "1fj2aj", "input": "What is the purpose of singles in the music industry?", "output": [{"answer": "Singles are generally used as a way of promoting an album, before and after the release of said album. These days it's fairly normal to release one, two, or sometimes even three singles prior to an album's release date, in order to generate a bit of hype. The first single usually comes out a month or so before. The song gets played on the radio, YouTube etc., and people start downloading it. Chart success, word of mouth or plain old plugging gets the hype train rolling. Then the second single is released either a week before the album or sometimes simultaneously with the album, and people who enjoy the song will hopefully then go and purchase the album right away. It's not uncommon for the single released in unison with the album to be the most radio-friendly/commercial, in order to generate the most buzz possible for the album and attract listeners from outside the artist's usual fanbase. Subsequent singles released after the album make extra money and serve to keep the album in the public eye - if the record label keeps the artist on the radio with fresh new songs, the label can continue to promote the album even if the artist is busy touring. Sometimes, the initial response to an album can be disappointing in terms of sales, but a strong third or fourth single can be a great boost. Consider the example of *Wonderwall* from Oasis' second album *(What's the Story) Morning Glory?*. *Wonderwall* was the third single, released 4 weeks after the album. The album did not sell well outside the UK initially but after the release of *Wonderwall*, a chart topper in several countries, the album became an international success. If the artist has not yet released an album, the record label will sometimes use a single as a way to gauge the public's response to said artist and decide whether or not to record an album with them. Artists will occasionally release non-album singles, songs that are not meant to promote their album and don't appear on the tracklisting. This can be for a number of reasons, including: to keep the band on the radio while they are between albums, to give something extra to the fans, if the song was featured on a film's soundtrack album, or simply because the artist feels like it. Hope this helped."}]}
{"id": "3tyv4b", "input": "How is selling fan art legal?", "output": [{"answer": "It isn't legal, either in Canada, the US, or Japan. In Canada and the US, fanworks would be derivative works, that is, works that in part derives from, or duplicates, another work (henceforth \"original work\"). In both country's respective copyright statutes, the author of the original work retains the exclusive right to create derivative works and duplications, subject to a large number of \"fair use\" defences. Now then, like /u/TokyoJokeyo said, copyright is civil law, so the state isn't automatically going to come after you, but the original author could, if they bothered to spend the legal fees, and somehow find you (which may require them to have to demand the derivative work creator's address, contact information, etc, which is extra trouble). The problem is, once they do, the derivative work creator will run into two legal issues: 1. \"Fair use\" is a defence, which means that the original work author only has to prove that your material is derivative, and then the derivative work author would have to prove fair use, which may require more legal funds than they can feasibly bring to bear ($250/hr is a reasonable rate for lawyers). The recent Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. may make it more difficult for the original work author to gain a takedown order, or some form of injunction, but... 2. If you are selling the stuff, tough luck. That's most likely not fair use. If you are in Japan, you may be in deeper trouble. Japan has a much stronger conception of moral rights, so if the fan work could be considered prejudicial to the moral rights of the author (think of Nintendo not liking Super Mario Bros. Z or pictures of Mario and Luigi kissing), they can have it taken down. Notice: I am not a lawyer. I hope that I'll not have to be a lawyer. Edit: u/Ah-Q below notes that it is a crime in the US.

{"id": "4nezbe", "input": "How does our brain \"choose\" how long to sleep?", "output": [{"answer": "Interestingly enough, sleep is our \"default state\", so to speak; we are kept awake by the presence of certain chemicals in the brain, and we return to sleep as they are removed from the body. As you sleep, your hypothalamus produces a chemical called acetylcholine, which induces wakefulness by action on the neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The longer you're asleep, the greater the buildup of acetylcholine in your brain, and eventually you wake up. Throughout the day, as you go about your routine, your brain begins to produce a chemical called adenosine, which acts as an antagonist to acetylcholine, progressively lowering its concentration in your brain throughout the day. This causes you to become tired, even in the middle of the day, if you've gone a long time without sleep. At the end of the day, in response to a lower amount of blue-spectrum light, your brain begins to produce progressively larger quantities of melatonin. This chemical eventually interacts with the GABA neurotransmitter to enable you to transition into sleep, once concentrations of it exceed concentrations of acetylcholine by a fair margin. As far as why you sleep less when uncomfortable: external stimuli cause your body to produce acetylcholine spontaneously, it's what causes something to suddenly grab our attention. If you lay in a position where your muscles are strained, this strain will progressively release more and more acetylcholine in response to the pain signals, much more than would be produced if you were sleeping in a position that didn't cause so much sensory information to be sent to the brain. Eventually the concentration of acetylcholine becomes great enough to wake you up. I hope this is a full enough explanation for you, if you have any questions, I'm willing to answer them."}]}

As for clothing size, sizing used to mean something (like every x inch larger would make one larger size or something). Women's size chart back in the day start with 8 because anything smaller would fall under junior or children's size (the same way adult shoe sizes is a continuation of children shoe sizes). The [US government actually tried to make a standardized sizing chart]( URL_0 ), which was useful during World War II when they needed to produce various uniforms for women. Then [there's more attempts at standardization]( URL_3 ). [Sewing patterns today still use the older sizing]( URL_2 ). While vanity sizing and our standard of slimness is certainly a contributing factor, clothing manufacturers also need to make a reasonable range that encompass most of their target consumers. Instead of having the smallest size starting at standardized 8 (who might not even shop at your place) and run out of sizes for anyone bigger than the standardized range (who might only buy your clothes), moving the smallest size they make down to 0 or 2 and correspond to fit the slimmest people in their specific segment of consumers so they don't have to split off bigger sizes to another department. I began to speculate this after realizing (not to stereotype people) that stores with more plus size shoppers (but do not specifically market only plus size clothing) tend to make their sizes much bigger than stores that cater to younger women. Some stores that specialize in plus size clothing and stores with a older clientele even do away with these sizes all together and [invented entirely different size charts]( URL_1 )."}]}

How does it draw such a dedicated community?", "output": [{"answer": "IMO what makes CS so special is that its a very high quality, precise game, with a good engine and game mechanics. A casual gamer wouldn't understand the difference between a generic big studio game with guns in it and counter strike. The difference is mainly in how precise the game mechanics are and the skill gap, the lack of iron sights and the aiming system basically means that you won't get a kill if you can't aim well. If the best CS player in the world went up against a total noob, the noob may be able to kill them 1 for every 1 million times he is killed (I am not exaggerating). In Black OPs 3, it may be 1 to 10, or 1 to 100. Funnily enough, the majority of redditors who think they are not even casual FPS players don't realise that Modern Warfare 1, (CoD4), and its predecessors CoD2 and vCoD were almost on par with CS1.6 and CS:S at the time. Unfortunately CoD4 became a huge commercial success and was very console friendly, the games ended up being ruined and the sharpness and consistency of what you had in CoD4 was eroded every year until you get what you have right now with Black OPs 3. I.e., when you shoot a gun, its not consistently precise, it takes less skill and aim to kill people, the game itself doesnt support dedicated servers, mod tools etc. CoD4 and CS allowed for people to create professional mods that suited 5v5 competitive play. In the CoD4 sequels, the devs removed the tools that allowed modders to remove all the kill streak crap and change the damage model of the guns to make it more like CS, in CS:S successor CS:GO the devs incorporated these things into the game fully acknowledging the competitive community which was a no-brainer. As you can tell this all breaks my heart as I was a CoD4 fan, and the fact that redditors who post like they know anything about FPS don't even know about what it was like. Then a random guy uses the name 'modern warfare' as if its the standard for shit for the comparison when ironically modern warfare used to be on par with it. Its important to note that CoD4 included special console commands that no other game (including any other cod) had, which uniquely changed the look and colour tone of the game, working wonders for machinma/fragmovie editors. Even CS:GO lacks this feature which is simply amazing to have for making the game look a certain way. Instead BF4 and CS:GO look like dull dog shit compared to a CoD4 movie config. This is important because it contributed to the reason why in 2008-2009 CoD4 was about even with CS:S in its community. Games like crysis with super complex graphics and physics engines lack that crucial consistency for competitive play, and without the high quality competitive play there will never be a strong core to the community behind the game."}]}

This leads to much greater public acceptance of counter-terrorism intelligence. And on another angle, the UK is a very close knit island with a dense population, isolationism and privacy (in the US context that is commonly viewed on this site) is not a luxury people have. It's a society where people must be social, and adhere to accepted social norms so that everyone can get on with daily life.

It's from the same ilk who characterise people of African decent as inherently lazy or intellectually inferior. It serves an imperialist agenda at the top level and unfortunately a lot of the dumdums who don't even realise they are serving power swallow it whole. If you dehumanise people it is much easier to behave atrociously towards them - and let us be in no doubt, the last 25 years of treatment of the people of Iraq constitutes an atrocity. But much easier on the conscience to say \"They were always like this, it's not our fault, let them fight amongst themselves\" etc. Respectfully, a short history lesson. Before the two gulf wars, and the crippling period of sanctions between those wars, Iraq was a highly functioning dictatorship, with dubious human rights records but nonetheless with the security that allowed the country to thrive. Literacy rates were the envy of the region, higher education was greatly prized, there was a highly functional healthcare system (again amongst the best in the region) etc. Though there were loyalties along religious, ethnic and sectarian lines (and by the way, there are in just about every western democracy I can think of too - look at the states) there was a degree of mixing and towns were not totally \"ghettoised\" - for example, Baghdad had a Christian population approaching 10% who were free to worship in their own way. What happened is Iraq was getting too powerful for the US's liking, expanding in ambition and throwing its weight around. Students of history will know that: April Glaspie told Saddam Hussein that the US would take no interest in the invasion of Kuwait - so he went ahead. As a justification for intervention in Kuwait, \"Nayirah\" testified that Iraqi soldiers were taking babies out of incubators and leaving them to die - a campaign that was run by public relations company Hill and Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government - it was all proven to be lies - but a good pretext to garner public support for military intervention - familiar?! As part of the US campaign depleted uranium was dropped in southern iraq, resulting in increased infant leukaemia and severe genetic mutations on birth. After Iraq was systematically bombed during the first gulf war, hugely crippling sanctions were imposed. Ostensibly to prevent a military build up, they effectively prevented a rebuilding of the country. Educational and medical standards plummeted, there was the beginnings of a \"brain-drain\" with the country's top talent seeking to relocate, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died and many millions more were impoverished. In the meantime, Iraq could only export oil under hugely restrictive Oil for Food programme, meaning the oil continued to flow whilst the country continued to stagnate. Gulf War Two happened despite no evidence of weapons of mass destruction (in fact Hans Blix who lead the UN inspections likened the US Bush administration to witch hunters, with a predetermined view and seeking evidence to support a foregone conclusion). Perhaps the biggest single blunder as other posters here have mentioned was the systematic disbanding of the Iraqi police and military immediately after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This left a power vacuum and an unemployed, largely Sunni sympathising group of highly trained soldiers. In this context, sectarian differences came to the fore - before the war, Sunni -Shia intermarriages were very common. Tribal identity was less important. In times of trouble, these identities become more important and more primary. After the second war, mixed marriages dropped off. Militia would go through towns, separating Sunni from Shia, in attempts to establish \"Shia only\" or \"Sunni only\" towns. The maps showing the increasing ghettoisation of Baghdad during this period make for heartbreaking viewing. For me most sinister of all is the violence against academics in post-invasion Iraq. About 300 were killed between 2003 and 2007. Robert Fisk stated in 2004 that \"university staff suspect that there is a campaign to strip Iraq of its academics, to complete the destruction of Iraq's cultural identity which began when the American army entered Baghdad.\" What the hell is going on here? A systematic attempt to rob the country of its intelligentsia, destroy its ability to educate its people, to eliminate any view of this place as the cradle of civilisation. In short, our generation has borne witness to the systematic destruction of Iraq over the past 25 years. Much of it was intentional, some of it was blundering, all of it was to serve a heinous political agenda. The humiliation of the Iraqis along with the perpetuation of negative racist stereotypes about them is all part of the process."}]}
{"id": "2umsnl", "input": "How come people don't borrow from low-interest rate countries like Japan and deposit it in high-interest rate countries like Argentina?", "output": [{"answer": "Let me write a longer drawn out question /explanation, as it sounds like you're confused from your other responses. Scenario: You have 0, but you have a good credit score, so you apply for a Line of Credit in Japan (ignoring all regulations and rules), and are approved for a loan of 100,000 yen. (Roughly 850 USD). What's important to note here is the posted interest rates. I couldn't find a lot of data on Japan, but it looks like their posted interest rate is 0.1%. This is for huge dollar value loans. Everyday citizens don't qualify for this. Your line of credit with BoJ is probably going to be around 3-4%. So you take your 100,000 yen, and convert it to Argentinian Pesos. The conversion rate I could find was 1 JPY = 0.0736139 ARS. Again, this is for huge currency conversions from bank to bank. Your rate will undoubtedly be much worse. Even if we gave you the perfect conversion rate (which you will not get), you would need to open either some kind of savings account or an investment account to deposit your ~7,000 Argentinian Pesos in. To make money with your plan, you would need to have a rate of return that is much higher than the 3-4% the BoJ is charging you. Remember that even though the bank of argentina is saying 7%, joe schmoe is going to get much less on his savings account than that. Remember that every month the BoJ is going to want an interest payment on it's loan. That's ~3000 yen / 220 pesos every month. If you can find a savings account that pays 7% interest (again, not likely), you'll be bringing in a cool ~490 pesos a month. Congrats! You're making money! The biggest downside to all this is the fees. You're going to get dinged on conversion fees when you convert pesos  >  yen every month. You're also going to have to pay a fee to wire the funds from Argentina to Japan (at least $15-$30 USD, or ~130 pesos). Unless you want to travel back and forth in person... Finally, we're assuming that all currencies remain exactly the same forever. If the Pesos go down, or the yen goes up, or interest rates change at all in either country, your plan could go to hell quickly. This is all assuming of course that Argentina doesn't default on their loans again (as per /u/Mason11987)"}]}
{"id": "42ek2u", "input": "What would happen, hypothetically, if everyone immediately stopped paying back their student loans (in the U.S.)?", "output": [{"answer": "Its interesting because there is nothing tangible with equity as collateral in a student loan. You are basically gambling on a person's future. I loan you $50k so you can go to school with the idea that of COURSE you will pay it back. Why wouldn't you? You are taking that money for a better future that is readily out there and available for you. And you can pay me back with interest. Its not like a mortgage where I need the house you are buying as collateral. Or an auto loan. In both those cases essentially the purchased product can be essentially legally repossessed by whomever the loaning authority is. IE the bank gets your house or the credit union gets your car or w/e. It isn't good. And the value of the house can fluctuate so it might not be worth the value of the original loan minus payments and already paid plus interest. And the car will most likely drop in value. But STILL... there is something you can take back if loan payments aren't met. But with education... what do you repossess? Nothing. That said in reality the government can garnish wages and do other fun stuff (like take all your tax refund) to get their money back. And since there is income based repayment (since 2009) they can do it up until the day you die. So really its impossible to not repay that loan. IF... IF somehow everyone just dropped off the grid and didn't repay their loans and couldn't be tracked down well then the government or whatever financial institution would be out a lotta cash. It would be bailout season again I'm sure but on a much bigger scale. Likely wrecking the US and global economy for quite a long while!"}]}

Ben - It\u2019s a great effect and it\u2019s a lovely, lovely question because I actually had \u2013 I had to look this up and as soon as I read the question, I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant! Why didn\u2019t I look this up before?\u201d But it has all to do with the substance in toothpaste called sodium laureth sulfate. There\u2019s a few similar chemicals that do the same thing. It\u2019s a surfactant which means that it lowers the surface tension of a liquid. Kat - Those are classic cleaners, aren\u2019t they? Ben - Yes. You\u2019ll find it in detergents, you\u2019ll find it in all sorts of different things that rely on breaking surface tension, and it\u2019s in the toothpaste, to make sure that you get a good foam from the toothpaste while you clean your teeth and look a bit rabid. Kat - Speak for yourself... Ben - But they also interact with that taste buds in two key ways: They inhibit the taste buds that perceive sweetness, so whatever you eat afterwards will taste less sweet and then they break up fatty molecules called phospholipids and these phospholipids live on the surface of our tongue, and they inhibit the receptors for bitterness. So, not only do we get the effect through the knocking down of the sweetness, but actually boosting the bitterness that you get as well. So, that means anything you eat will taste less sweet and much more bitter which is why orange juice in particular, which we know is normally very sweet, is really quite foul. There\u2019s also menthol in there, and that has a temperature effect which fools your sensory nerves into being more sensitive to cold. So, fresh orange juice, fresh from the fridge may sound great and refreshing, will be good with your breakfast, but it\u2019ll taste bitter and it will be painfully cold. Chris - I met someone a little while back who\u2019s at the Oxford University. He\u2019s a chemist and he showed me a wonderful trick with glucose because glucose comes in two 'handednesses'. There\u2019s right handed glucose and left handed. What that means is, it\u2019s a bit like if I had a glucose molecule and I put it in front of a mirror, you\u2019ll have a molecule in one configuration in your hand, you\u2019d have the molecule with its mirror image in the reflection. And nature is just the same. There are both forms of the sugar in nature. It just so happens that the human body uses the D-form, the right handed form. He brought with him some left handed glucose and I tasted it and guess what it tasted like? Ben - I have no idea. Chris - Do you think it\u2019s sweet? Kat - Cherries. Ben - I\u2019d assume it would be sweet because it\u2019s the same atoms, isn\u2019t it? Built into their molecule, just kind of reflected. Kat - No, if it can\u2019t be recognized. Chris - No. It tastes like salt, which is salty. It was disgusting. It\u2019s just a salty sort of (luhhrr) flavor. It wasn\u2019t very nice at all because it\u2019s the wrong shape to fit into the taste receptors on your tongue, just like Kat says. Ben - Wow!"}]}

Illinois for example is blatantly gerrymandered, but there is nothing we can do about it, because the law makers made a law that says they get to do it, which especially in Illinois' case, leads to the crazy corruption you correctly assumed would accompany the practice. It's not obviously bad from the view point of the law makers, who do it to ensure an easier path to office for members of their party. If the repubs here drew the map, it would look vastly different than how it is now, and if a computer drew the map, it would be a 3rd version. The ensuring that your political party optimizes the possible number of votes in their district is the good of it, for them. There is no good for the people, you are overlooking, when it comes to gerrymandering. Can it be changed? That is a state by state question. I believe there are only a handful of states that currently draw their districts by \"impartial\" computer programing. And I say that, because the program is only as fair as the math used to create it, and it keeps evolving. [I submitted this post]( URL_0 ) about fixing the map in Illinois, specifically, with a computer program.

This means you actually have 50 apples? Yes - sort of. It's important to be clear about what negative means though in order for the example to make sense. In physics, this part is really easy to conceptualize because when you're dealing with vectors (velocity, for instance), a negative value just means a positive value in the opposite direction. In your sets/apples example though, we need to figure out how that would apply. What does it mean to have a set of negative 10 apples? It would mean that you're in debt 10 apples. So if somebody gives you negative 10 apples, they're taking 10 apples away from you. It's the exact opposite of them giving you *positive* 10 apples, which would be them simply giving you 10 apples. What about a negative set? Same thing applies. If somebody gives you a negative set of something, they're taking a set away from you. If they give you negative 5 sets of something, they're taking away 5 sets of that something from you. So what if I give you negative 5 sets of negative 10 apples? That means I'm actually taking 5 sets of negative 10 apples from you. Another way to say that would be I'm having you give me 5 sets of negative 10 apples. And since giving somebody a set of negative 10 apples is the same thing as taking 10 apples from them, **by giving you negative 5 sets of negative 10 apples, I am essentially giving you 50 apples.**"}]}

{"id": "3i10px", "input": "Why are stimulants used to treat ADHD?", "output": [{"answer": "**ELI5: Why are stimulants used to treat ADHD?** Late to the party OP, sorry. But I felt it was important to answer your question. I am 58, have ADHD, and have been studying this disorder intensely for over 10 years. My goal is never to present the \u201cright\u201d solutions to others, it is only to share my experience, and the hope that others may benefit. Based on that, I would like to share my thoughts about what, and how I might tell a 5 year old child about their ADHD, and how a treatment such as stimulants might work. ------- And, this is similar to what I told my 11 year old son when he was diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed Adderall - which I was also taking at the time. The following example is also a roughed out excerpt from a book about Adult ADHD that I have been working on for several years. It is still in development *[please forgive me, I promise this is NOT self-promotion.]* ------- If you have a young child with ADHD, who doesn\u2019t understand what is happening - and why they may have to take stimulant medication \u2013 please consider using this story example when attempting to help them cope with the concept. I\u2019ve been there - both with my son, and with myself. This may be long, but it\u2019s worth taking the time to share this with a young child who is almost certain to feel confused and frustrated about why they struggle so much, or why adults yell at them, or why they feel so different from the other kids at school, or why they feel stupid, or why they have no friends, or why they have to repeat a grade, or why it is so hard to read and study, or why they have to go to a psychologist or psychiatrist and, of course, why they may have to take stimulant medication. ------- As you read the following explanation - that I believe a 5 year old might understand - please think about how you might change or distill it to be more effective or appropriate for your own child, and in your own situation. I sincerely hope it can help someone deal more effectively with this incredibly frustrating and misunderstood disorder. ------- *\"Son / Daughter, I want to talk with you about your ADHD and about the medication the doctor wants to prescribe. But first, I wanted to tell you a story. Is that OK? Great, try and listen closely. But if you need to get up, move, feel bored or wanting to do something else, we can put the story on pause for a minute while you do it. I\u2019ll even help. But then we must come right back to the story, because it\u2019s really important. Is that a deal? Thanks. OK, so imagine tons of really big traffic intersections with 1000\u2019s of roads entering them \u2013 and they are extremely busy all the time. AND, all of the cars going through them are being driven by people traveling to their jobs - and these are jobs which are important to keeping the world safe and healthy.* ------- *BUT, because of the unpredictable traffic that change constantly, the city had a great idea. Instead of using the normal red, yellow and green traffic signals to organize the flow of all the cars, they hired really awesome, cyborg policemen with perfect programming. By watching the changing flow of traffic over millions of years, they have become experts at deciding WHEN each car should go through the intersection AND can even tell some of the more confused drivers WHERE they are supposed to go. With the policemen\u2019s direction, the traffic moves and flows perfectly, with each car moving through the intersection without being hit, cut-off by another car, or lost in the city. Everyone gets to the right location, and arrives at their jobs at the right time, and in the right order. The cyborg traffic policemen\u2019s awesome skills allow these people to work together perfectly with all of the other workers on whom they depend. Do you understand how this works? Good!* ------- *NOW, imagine that these policemen have a spell put on them. You\u2019ve seen different spells in the movies, and heard about them in the books I\u2019ve read to you? Anyway, the spell hurt our awesome traffic cyborg policemen. All of sudden, they either slowed down a lot, stopped working, or didn\u2019t work right. Guess what happened? Yup! The traffic goes crazy. All of our drivers are still trying to get to their jobs, but most of them really don\u2019t know when they are supposed to go through the intersection, or in what order. AND NOW, the more confused drivers still don\u2019t know where to go. The people in the cars eventually get to their jobs, but mostly not at the right times or in the right order, which makes it really hard to do their jobs well \u2013 no matter how hard they try. Sometimes their work doesn\u2019t even get done at all - which is super frustrating. Does this make sense to you? So, what do you think might help us correct this problem? You\u2019re Right! We should try and take the spell off the awesome cyborg traffic policemen so they can get back to doing their important jobs, like they were programmed to do - properly directing the cars through the intersections.* ------- *Now as you think about this story, I want you to imagine that this traffic, these intersections, and the awesome cyborg policemen are really, really tiny \u2013 and they are inside your brain, helping make things work right. Because your brain actually has really cool things like these inside it. There are millions and millions of interconnected pathways that help move electricity and important chemicals from one place to another \u2013 at super-fast speeds. These are like the roads in our story on which the people in their cars move in order to get to their jobs. BUT, like in our story, the cars have to go through intersections \u2013 which are like the connections in our brain where the electricity and chemicals pass through, which also have things like the awesome cyborg policemen who properly direct the traffic.* ------- *So, remember when you went to the doctor, and he told you that you had ADHD. He also told you that ADHD is a disorder \u2013 or problem that messes up the connections which allow electricity and chemicals to travel properly inside your brain. With ADHD, your brain works very differently than most other people. It\u2019s not always a bad thing, but it usually makes it harder for your brain - and you - to do many things that, for most people who don\u2019t have ADHD, are easier or simpler. Everyone struggles sometimes, but with ADHD, these struggles happen way more often, and usually to the point that a bunch of things in your life get much harder to do - which can even make you frustrated and sad. Have you ever felt this way?* ------- *Well, let\u2019s go back to our story. Since ADHD is a problem that messes up the connections which allow electricity and chemicals to travel properly inside your brain - what does this mean? In our story, what allowed the cars and traffic to move well? Yup, the awesome cyborg policemen at the intersections \u2013 who are like the things in the connection of your brain - through which the electricity and chemicals must travel. So, if ADHD messes that up, then that must mean that ADHD is like the spell that messed with our awesome cyborg policemen.* ------- *So, the only thing we didn\u2019t discuss in our story, was how they were going fix the awesome cyborg policemen. Well instead of going back to our story, let\u2019s keep talking about your brain, and your ADHD \u2013 which is kind of like the spell on the awesome cyborg policemen. What do you think might help allow the awesome cyborg policemen in your brain to do their jobs the way they are supposed to, and allow your traffic to move correctly? Yup! The stimulant medication that the doctor wants you to take. It helps correct that part of your brain that is like the awesome cyborg policemen. It reduces the power of the spell. Whenever you take the medication, they can do their jobs more effectively without slowing down, stopping, or directing traffic in the wrong order. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions (of course you do.) Now does it make more sense? Great!* ------- *And remember, ADHD is a very confusing disorder that almost everyone has a hard time understanding - even doctors. So, if anyone tells you that you shouldn\u2019t be taking this medication, or makes you feel guilty or bad because you are taking it, they probably haven\u2019t heard the story I just told you. And, some people may have heard the story, but don\u2019t accept it because they think they are smarter and have all the right answers. They are not smarter, and there are no \u201cright\u201d answers for everyone. The only right answers, are the ones that work right for you. But that means they would have to know you as well as we do. And they never will. And, since they don\u2019t know you as well as we do, they can\u2019t possibly know the right answers for you. Does that make sense? The other, more important thing they don\u2019t understand is that - like the cyborg policemen in our story \u2013 even when things get difficult, you will always be AWESOME! And ADHD will never change that!* -------------------------------- **[FOOTNOTE: There is, however, one aspect of ADHD that I would not discuss with your 5 year old; ADHD can last a lifetime. And without a medical breakthrough, or a flexible, encouraging, positive environment in which their ADHD is understood and accepted - where they can have a happy and productive personal and work life - they may be taking their medication for a very long time.]** Thanks for reading!"}]}

Women or men kidnaped in the streets, then beaten, drugged with heroin, making them addicts and unable to think clearly. Then forced to prostitute themselves. Some women are kidnaped with their children and then threatened with the promise of killing their kids, which become themselves pimps as they're brought up by the pimp's family. Currently, young pimps make girls fall in love with them, then promised a lovely life as hubby and wife, which happens for a couple of months, then the \"husband\" changes, fakes a situation of lack of money and asks the woman to prostitute to help him. Sometimes, pimps have 5 or 6 women in the same situation. Finally, a couple of weeks ago, an article talked about a horrible human being who considers himself the last of the great pimps of Quetzaltenango. He kidnaps women, forces them to prostitute and the police and inhabitants of the city help him to keep an eye on the girls. If any women try to run away, the police delivers her back to the pimp's house where he has a crocodile that eats people. Yes, your read that correctly, he has a fucking crocodile in a pit in his house which is fed sometimes with parts of bodies and sometimes with living human beings. This idea really deters any women from escaping.

{"id": "2e3zk4", "input": "From a legal standpoint, how much does diplomatic immunity actually allow a person to get away with?", "output": [{"answer": "Diplomatic immunity actually comes in a couple of forms. High level diplomats have more or less blanket immunity, they can shoot someone in broad daylight in the middle of the street and not be prosecuted for it. Though they can be asked to leave or have their immunity waived by their country. But lower level officials and members of NGO's will have immunity related to their official duties, but not blanket immunity. So if your job is to guard an ambassador you might allowed to shoot someone in broad daylight - if they are threatening an ambassador. But you can't just randomly start shooting people. Embassy grounds are another matter, as they are considered the sovereign territory of the country based there, and the host countries laws don't apply. Edit - not quite right. Embassy grounds are legally protected territory but not always part of the sovereign territory of the visiting country (that has to be by special arrangement). The vienna convention does not actually cover civil liability, including car accidents and so on, at least not on personal business. But most countries would be unlikely to try their luck on such matters, as the line between 'personal' and 'business' for high level officials is rather grey. By definition they're always on business if they are a consular official living in a foreign country as part of their job basically. Still, the official line is, that, for example, you are still subject to traffic tickets if you are in the US for example. Though there's basically no mechanism to force you to pay. This is why there is constant tension in new york with traffic tickets, the US requires that you pay but if you don't they can't do anything about it."}]}

{"id": "5godux", "input": "What are the negative effects of mass incarceration in the United States?", "output": [{"answer": "The US prison system is one of the worst in the developed western world. First. There is this strange feedback loop from many prisons being private, rather than state owned. A state owned prison wants to minimise inmates because they area a cost to the state. A private prison wants to maximise the inmates because that maximises the profit. A state wants to encourage rehabilitation to prevent people from re-offending. A private prison wants as many people in there as often. If they re-offend, it's more likely that happens so rehabilitation isn't widely done. Note: The US is slightly different in this regard too. The US has a culture that does not focus on rehab and does not *want* to focus on rehab. For the most part the US people are happy with using prison as retribution/punishment only. That means no rehab is good politics, because that's what people want. Terrible policy, because it has worse outcomes. Second (not unique to the US). Prison ingrains disadvantage, both for the individual and for the family. The person out of prison has no support network and limited job opportunities. How else are they supposed to afford things other than through crime? Let's say my father went to prison. Now my mother is on a single wage trying to raise a child with far less support (he's not paying much child support in prison). That tends to lead to poorer school results (for a variety of reasons) and worse social outcomes latter on. Education is the number one thing that has positive social benefits. Better job, better health, better life in general, less crime. Lack of education is correlated with the opposite. The result of these is it creates entire communities who have poor outcomes *and* perpetuates those poor outcomes. Entire communities end up with high crime. That normalises crime and perpetuates it at a wider community level too. This isn't unique to the US. What is unique to the US the scale. The private system and mass incarceration has made more people enter the crime cycle and it harder to exit than other countries. In doing so it's disadvantaged many thousands of people and disadvantaged them beyond what most other prison systems do. Edit: I see people arguing against rehab. The issue with the American system having no rehab and being purely retributive is multifaceted. Consider what happens *after* the sentence. The prison sentence is supposed to serve as the crime. However, without any supportive framework and quite a few barriers in place, when they leave the US system the person has been set up for failure. The reason every other western country focuses on rehab as well is because it has better outcomes at 3 levels. Individual, population, economic. If the people repeat offend that increases the crime rate *over the entire population*. All things equal, no rehab makes you less safe, not more. The US has increased the police force markedly to combat this and still has significantly worse outcomes than many western nations. Which leads to economics. Rehab makes people less likely to be in prison, so the cost of the prison system is reduced *and* it also requires a smaller police force to maintain the same crime rate."}]}

Film productions bring so much money into the local economy that many cities will bend over backwards to entice them to come by granting them tax exemptions and aiding them in securing locations. Securing permits to close down public streets can get very expensive and is a great way for municipalities to bring in money. Many people complain about the inconvenience that film productions bring into their communities but with them they also bring a lot of money to pour into the local economy.

{"id": "2lis0y", "input": "Why do Death With Dignity laws allow people with incurable, untreatable physical illness to end their lives if they wish, but not for people with incurable, untreatable mental illness?", "output": [{"answer": "As someone who has always had incredible depression I wish what you were suggesting was possible. I'll explain why. People talk about putting their pets \"out of their misery\" or \"ending their suffering\" all the time, so why not people? Why is a human being, a creature with much greater mental ability unable to make that decision for themselves? If you asked the dog, and it was able to respond, would it say yes or no? How is it crueler to make that offer to a human, than force it on an animal? That's my logic for death with dignity laws for people who are sick, but that also extends to mental illness. Here's the truth, I'm 28 and I haven't enjoyed being alive since maybe 12. At least that's the earliest I can remember wanting to die, it may have been earlier.. More than half my life has been spent wishing I didn't exist. Have there been stretches that were good? Of course, but never good enough where I had any happiness at life in general, only momentary fleeting happiness. And here's the dark truth no one wants to say, it's never going to change. Whatever it is that happy people have, I don't have it. Over time it's lead to me being even more disinterested in everything. Lack of ambition to further career, lack of confidence with women, lack of desire to improve myself in mostly any way (for some reason working out seems to be the exception though). Do I want a nice job making good money? Do I want a wife? Kids? Do I want to find passion in some more complex hobby than TV and video games? Of course, but the truth is, I'll never have any of that. You never hear about people being cured of depression. You only hear \"manage\", \"I've learned to deal with it\", ect... You don't get better, you just manage it. It will haunt me until the day I'm lucky enough to die. So why haven't I killed myself yet? A few reasons. First there's the family issue. Suicide is incredibly tough on the family of the person who kills themselves. Obviously there is the natural fear of death, and that holds me back. Finally, and I think this is the biggest reason, there's no way to do it. Pills don't work, you just get sick and often have more problems after the attempt due to lifelong damage. Cutting wrists? Fuck no, I'm terrified of blood, and it would be extremely painful. So obviously any other painful way is out. Jumping? Takes to long, and I don't think I could actually force myself to jump. Gun? That must be easy? Can't afford one, and very hard to buy a handgun where I live. Also, guns aren't even a guarantee. I could just blow off part of my brain and live the rest of my live with brain damage. On top of that, failure in any way leads to a lifetime of questioning, therapy, maybe even being institutionalized. So no realistic option for me. If it was legal for people like myself to go to a doctor, have him make a cocktail that would put me to sleep for good, I'd be all over it. No worry about botching due to fear/lack of knowledge/luck. No one walking in on my body. No questions. Just a rational, sound of mind human making the decision to no longer be alive. Why isn't it legal? Religion is a big part of it. Most religions consider suicide to be a terrible sin, and even extremely liberal countries still have morals guided by religion. A general human abhorrence of death is probably a major contributor. Obviously the fear that people rushing into the decision is a valid one as well. Also, people would rather someone live in misery quietly, than feel guilt for what they could have done. So yeah, I'll probably get crushed for my opinion, but that's my opinion on the issue. But in the end the happiest day of my life will be the day I finally do kill myself, and it would be wonderful if a legal means to make that happen sooner was available."}]}

[Alpha]( URL_1 ) is a stage in software development where things are far from complete: core features may not have been implemented, bugs and crashes are extremely common, and inventory items/money do not transfer to the final game. As of today, Star Citizen has raised $123.7 million (USD) in [crowdfunding]( URL_0 ) with which to develop the game; over 1.5 million accounts have been registered on the Roberts Space Industries (Star Citizen) website. You can view the current statistics [here]( URL_4 ). (Star Citizen is currently the most successful crowdfunding project to date.) Currently, there are two main sections of the game: the Star Citizen test universe and Arena Commander. In the test universe, you can fly ships in space and around space stations and asteroids, go on simple 'fetch missions,' dogfight with pirates and other players, and engage in FPS combat. In Arena Commander, you can fly your ship around a small area, learning its controls and testing its capabilities, or dogfight with other players or AI. (Players usually experience better performance in Arena Commander since it's a smaller game space.) For a full list of features currently available, please see the [Feature List]( URL_2 ) online. I don't know a lot of the criticism surrounding the game, but I'll throw a few out there: * **\"Chris Roberts (CEO/director of Star Citizen) is going back on his word when the project first launched! There aren't any periodic financial releases to the public to make sure our money isn't going to waste/being stolen.\"** (Does someone have a source on this? People mentioned he promised this, but I never found it.) * When development for this project first launched, Chris Roberts didn't expect it to be very big. I think his eyes were mostly on Squadron 42 (the campaign) and Star Citizen was supposed to be something small (the $3 million stretch mark was 40 star systems; it's currently sitting around 100 systems). He probably thought it would be a small team working on it and they could easily assemble a small financials document for release to the public on a regular basis. The project now sits at four offices around the world: California, Texas, Germany, and the UK. They have raised over $123 million and have wide community projects and games presentations. I'm not a finance professional, but I imagine it would be difficult to release a financial document summarizing their actions without breaking a law from one of those four locations or unintentionally leaking personal information about their actors/employees. * **\"The game is so late! It was supposed to be launched in 2016 and it's still years away from release!\"** * The game was originally planned to be much smaller with far fewer features than are currently planned. Some features are even implemented now that were never originally certain. More features = longer development time. * **\"This game is [pay-to-win]( URL_5 ). You can buy in-game money/ships with real-world money. This unbalances the game and rewards rich players.\"** * Yes, equipment in-game can be bought with real-world money. However, the developers promised that everything in the game would be available to purchase with in-game currency (or obtain somehow in-game). This game is largely skill-based (character does not level up; the player has to get better at what he does); a poor pilot in a military-class dogfighter will lose to a good pilot in a civilian-class ship. Yes, good equipment makes the game easier, but it's by no means a \"win button.\" There are a few ways to earn money that don't involve dogfighting (news running, mining, repair, trading, racing, crewing someone else's ship) and there will be a setting where you can lower your chance of running into PvP. You can also practice dogfighting in the virtual space of Arena Commander/the campaign. The real-money purchases are to support the game after it's released (operating costs like server time, bug fixes, new features, etc.) Note: I've posted this so I don't lose it, but I'll continue adding things over the next short while as I think of them.

{"id": "2anwqq", "input": "Israeli/Palestinian Conflict Gaza - July 2014", "output": [{"answer": "I think it's a mistake to attribute the conflict to the Mandate, it begins much earlier that that. Prior to becoming a British Mandate after the conclusion of the First World War, there was a Palestinian Jewish population, made up mostly of the descendants of [Sephardic Jews]( URL_4 ). They became to be known as the [Mizrahi]( URL_2 ). There was not that huge of a distinction between Jew and non-Jew during the Ottoman days, as (unlike Europe) there were no restrictions on trade or movement for Jews there. It wasn't until the migration of European Jews that there had been a raft of activity that was designed and carried out to frustrate socialization between Jews and Arabs. Shortly before that time, [Theodor Herzel]( URL_7 ) had founded a movement that stated that Jews could never assimilate and participate as equal members in European society. After the [Dreyfus Affair]( URL_5 ) and the progroms against Jews in Russia, many had flocked to his cause, which was (at first) considered more of an extremist sect, as opposed to a mainstream, politically neutral idea (as it is today). This movement was known as Zionism. The problem is that Herzel and other Zionists were not uneffected by colonialism and race ideology. During this time before the First World War, Europe had embarked on the great imperialist project of dividing the world markets and its resources among themselves, conquering whole continents and subjecting it to its rule, justifying themselves by claiming the indigenous populations of wherever they went were racially inferior. So it's no surprise that Herzel felt that a Jewish state could only be built under the patronage of one of the imperialist powers. Because the European Jews would inevitably be a minority wherever they settled, and since they would incur the hostility of whatever indigenous population they were colonizing, they could not succeed without the help of a European power. In fact, Palestine was only one of several territories Herzl considered for colonization. Argentina, Uganda, and Cyprus were listed as many possible locations for the Jewish state. But the religious faction in the Zionist movement fought hard for Palestine and Herzl, never one to miss the power of a symbol, agreed that the ancient Jewish \"homeland\" would give the movement more emotional power. So fast forward to 1896-1900. European Jewish migration picks up to the \"holy land.\" Herzel, still ever-willing to seek a supporter of their cause, was willing to beg from the table of every colonial power, no matter how terrible they were. He met with all of them - the German Kaiser, the Turks, the Russian Tsar, and the British Empire. In 1896, a few decades before the First World War, Herzl entered into negotiations with the Turkish Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled over Palestine for more than five hundred years. Herzl offered the Sultan a deal - in exchange for giving Palestine to the Jews, the Zionist movement would help soften world condemnation of Turkey for its genocidal campaign against the Armenians. He even pledged to meet with Armenian leaders to convince them to call off their resistance struggle! In his diary, Herzl wrote: \"[The Sultan] could and would receive me as a friend\u2013after I had rendered him a service.\u2026 For one thing I am to influence the European press\u2026to handle the Armenian question in a spirit more friendly to the Turks: for another, I am to induce the Armenian leaders directly to submit to him, whereupon he will make all sorts of concessions to them.\u2026 I immediately told [Hamid\u2019s agent] that I was ready a me mettre en campagne [to start my campaign.]\" With the arrival of many [Ashkenazi Jews]( URL_3 ) during Herzel's catering with the many European powers, the Zionist settlers made it clear that they were not there to colonize in the traditional European sense (not to create new markets for itself, acquire more resources, or to use the indigenous population as a cheap source of labor) but to completely replace that indigenous population. The goal was to create an exclusively Jewish state with a Jewish majority, which meant they created parallel organizations from the natives, by which they bought (or stole) as much Arab land as possible, by which they had Jewish land and shopowners only employ Jews and have Jewish trade unionists exclude Arabs so that they could dominate the labor market, and so on. As these parallel Jewish-colonial structures started to sprout, the existing structures of segregation in education and housing ensured that intermarriage and communication between the two were very rare. Of course, as Britain conquered and declared the British Mandate, Zionists (who again, were courting all of the imperial powers) found an opportunity. Chain Weizmann, the first President of Israel and inheritor of Herzel's project, thought that this was a good thing: \"...should Britain encourage Jewish settlement there, as a British dependency, we could have in twenty to thirty years a million Jews out there, perhaps more; they would develop the country, bring back civilization to it and form a very effective guard for the Suez Canal.\" And with that, Jewish migration indeed very rapidly picked up into the 1920s, which exacerbated the acquisition of Arab land and their exclusion from the labor market. This led to racial tensions between the two, with several Arabs riots throughout that decade (they were very similar to pogroms). To stabilize that fragile situation, Britain had declared a cessation of all Jewish migration into the Mandate, which led to an outbreak of Jewish terrorism, both on Arabs and the Majesty's occupying army. But as Arab nationalism picked up - see [the 1920 Iraqi revolt]( URL_8 ) - there was a fear that pan-Arabism posed a worse threat. Sir Ronald Storrs, the first Governor of Jerusalem, thought that a Jewish state in Palestine could be beneficial for the British Empire, as it \"...will form for England a little loyal Jewish Ulster in a sea of potentially hostile Arabism,\" referencing the Protestant minority in north Ireland that allowed them to split the Island. So, for that while, the Jewish parallel government and its growing paramilitary was tolerated. British colonial rule had periodically collaborated and depended on the use of the [Haganah]( URL_0 ), the precursor of the Israeli Defense Forces. Some of the key training for Zionist paramilitaries before 1948 was in supporting British colonial repression of the Palestinian Arab national liberation struggle in 1936-9, just as fascism was ravaging Europe. Britain assisted in the formation of the Jewish police, which was 1,240-strong, but expanded over the next two years so that by 1939, it numbered 14,500 men. The training they received was usually passed on to thousands of others who were not included in the force - such as those in the Haganah. The [Special Night Squads]( URL_1 ) were a notoriously brutal manifestation of this collusion and they (to me) show a lot about how Israel's current ROE's (rules of engagement) work in relation to the conflict in Gaza. Orde Wingate, a senior British army officer and Zionist, organized them. Wingate's role is still commemorated, with many streets and schools named after him in Israel. His doctrine was based on surprise, offensive daring, deep penetration and high mobility. According to Israeli historian Tom Segev, he also taught the Squad torture, on-the-spot executions, mass detention without trial, black flag operations, etc. All of which was perfectly normal for the British. Charles Tegart, who also used similar tactics during his time in the Calcutta police, was requisitioned to Palestine during the revolt, where he provided his expert assistance in the formation of [Arab Investigation Centres]( URL_6 ), where Palestinians were brutally tortured. At the outbreak of the Second World War, British policy of using Jewish colonists as a means of preserving their rule led to the training of a further 50,000 Haganah troops. The revelations of the Holocaust and the Balfour Agreement, along with the agreed proclamation on how territory would be divided amongst the Arabs and Jews, had granted public legitimacy to the Jews that had settled in Palestine, and with the outbreak of the war in 1948 the Zionist leadership inherited Britain's counterinsurgency war on the Palestinians, and (after easily defeating Arab armies) had ethnically cleansed through a system of terror, massacres, the destruction of villages and dispossession, 700,000 Palestinians, who scattered into the West Bank and Gaza. This is what started the conflict. See: the Nakbah."}]}

On the flip side carts were super fast to load, CDs were extremely slow, Nintendo bet on the small and fast, thus no FMVs. Address space doesn't seem to be an issue. From what I've read it uses 32 bit addressing for data in memory and for loading from the cartridge. Since the biggest games were 64MB I could just assume its uses 32 bit for loading (though 26 bit would be exactly enough). For those who still care, here's how I usually explain computer addressing (I think it's a pretty clear way). Think of each of your fingers the as bit in a computer processor, thus representing a 10 bit computer. Each individual way of arranging your fingers open and closed represents a single address that you can read or write data from. Your fingers can be arranged in 1024 (2 to the power 10) different ways so you can read and write from 1024 address. A 16 bit computer can touch 2^16 (64k) addresses, 32 bit can touch 2^32 (4 billion). Of course schemes exist to use more 'address space' than there are bits, but they require extra computation time, and in any case clearly weren't necessary on the n64 (though they were on the original 8 bit NES for example).

{"id": "1s2eiv", "input": "If we were to dig a straight hole from one side of the Earth, through the core and everything, to the other side, what would happen to our planet?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so I think this warrants a direct reply. First issue I see is that the cylinder would need to be filled with air. Some have suggested this would cause weather disturbances, and it might. I don't think it'd be big though. Assuming a 1m cylinder, the total volume would be about 0.08km3. That's pretty small, in terms of atmosphere. 1.0x10-9 % of the atmosphere. I'm not a meteorologist, but i don't think that'd cause anything other than a stiff wind for a while. This assumes a constant pressure, which is, of course, not realistic. The pressure is actually a bit of a monster. For curiosities sake, I'm playing with it. If you just do a straight exponential calculation, assuming the mechanics all the way down are the same as on the surface, you'd get 2.145x1013 kPa. That's 20 000 000 000 the surface pressure, and more than enough to create what's called a supercritical fluid. At those pressures, the gases would actually \"condense\", but not in the conventional sense. It's a very strange state of matter that's tough to ELI5. However, this is not the case. Earth is not a point mass, and the gravitational force pulling on the air column would not be constant. So I'll fiddle with the calculus a bit more for fun, and let you know what it comes out to. [EDIT: I worked it out as far as I could, but apparently I broke WolframAlpha trying to solve it. So we may be out of luck here.] As for the magnetic field, I did't read anything that'd say it would be an immediate issue. Our magnetic field is caused by convection in the liquid outer core, which is driven by tidal forces caused by the Sun. A 1m radius tube would likely not cause a significant disruption here. The core is a problem though. The dynamics of the inner core are not well know, but most geologists agree that it's a solid (some imply a highly compressed liquid that acts solid, and a few other theories, but solid core seems to dominate). So we've just drilled a hole through a solid core. A core that has a faster angular rotation than the surface. So one of two things would happen: either the core would continue to rotate, and we would lose the tube pretty quick, or the core would stop relative to the surface. Not imagine how much angular energy is stored in a rotating, massive, sphere of highly dense nickel-iron alloy. That would all need to go somewhere.I don't know exactly how it'd be dispersed, but it would be like trying to stop a huge flywheel, and the results would likely be catastrophic. Extinction event catastrophic. The last issue, all the rest aside, comes down to temperature and radiation. The Earth's core is in the ballpark of 4 000K (about 4 300C, or 7 800F). There is no known substance that could shield from that heat, or any cooling method to avoid melting/combusting pretty much anything thrown in. Then there's the radiation. I couldn't find any exact numbers on concentration, so it's tough to find an exact dose. However, the Earth as a whole is estimated to produce 20TW of radioactive energy. So I'll go out on a limb and guess that the level would be past the lethal dose for a person, and probably irradiate any inorganic object going through. Let's assume that all this is a non-issue, for fun. Just to examine the timeline of jumping in. Since we are ignoring the fatal pressures, temperatures, and the like, let's just assume a complete vacuum. The number most people use to traverse the diameter of the planet is about 42 minutes, which isn't too bad (This number would not be affected by equatorial bulge, and would not have any significant difference due to elevation changes. Height is not a variable in a perfect pendulum). You'd hit about 11 000m/s at the core, assuming constant acceleration (some people are saying 8 000m/s. Not the number I got, but either way, it's crazy fast). Now, as you probably know, a perfect pendulum will reach exactly the same height at which it was dropped. Same for you. The elevation variations in the Earth's surface vary by about 0.22%. Not enough to make a significant difference in travel time, but definitely enough to make an impact on your arrival. So you'd likely fall short and oscillate infinitely. If there was any source of energy loss, you'd eventually settle at the core, experiencing zero G. Doesn't sound fun to me. However, you would also have angular velocity. Since the radius of rotation decreases with the descent, your relative lateral velocity would increase, and you'd end up riding the side of the tube all the way down, like a slide. Even though it's straight down, you'd fall kind of like it's angled. By the time you hit the core, all of the lateral energy would be gone. As you ascended, you'd now have *less* angular velocity than the tube, and slide all the way back up. Obviously, all this friction is a huge problem, and would pretty much destroy any hope you had of reaching the other side, unless we extended the hypothetical to include a frictionless tube. TL;DR This would be a very bad thing. You'd either destroy the planet, waste a lot of resources for something that wouldn't last, or inevitably become stuck in the core of the Earth forever. So let's not build this, okay? EDIT: Please feel free to review my statements. What I've found is hardly the gospel truth. Some of the theories I referenced are not completely accepted, some of my math may be off, and some is wild speculation. I mostly did this because I answered a few points, started digging, and then this behemoth formed. Also, apologies for it not all being completely ELI5, or for what likely may be a few spelling/grammar errors. This was just done on the fly between classes."}]}

The game knows where your position is, how does it act like it doesn't know where you are?", "output": [{"answer": "The game itself is a big collection of code and data. In the data is your position. So yes the game knows. But the AI is a specific routine. It's job is to simulate the actions of an intelligence. In a perfectly implemented example, it is only fed information it could see from it's own perspective. So, for example... a 3d fps game. It renders out what you can see each frame. Some things are behind other things and you can't see them. Everything behind a hill is hidden. So in our perfectly implemented AI, each AI might get a simple version of this pass that doesn't render a frame of video, but returns a list of objects the AI can see, and their visible size - a function of distance from the AI character and the size of the object. A few more steps. Filter this list down to objects that the AI might consider in its logic. The important stuff. Then work out a chance to see them and filter down to objects the AI notices. This could then be passed to another part of the AI that maintains state (what is the AI doing now? Wandering? Searching for ammo? Hunting? Is it scared? Angry? Aggressive? Chasing the player?) and makes decisions. You could do the same with audio. Can the AI hear the players footsteps? What if a plane is passing overhead? Maybe that would mask the sound. It's a bit like calculating a throw for sneak in D & D. Sound like a lot of work? It is. It won't scale very well. If we are checking what are all the things every AI can see and hear constantly then the computer is busy. We are taking up CPU cycles that could be used somewhere else and will make it run poorly on some hardware. Plus writing AI code is actually really hard and time consuming, and incredibly difficult to properly test. So the reality of AI is generally a bunch of heuristics.  URL_0   > In computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematical optimization, a heuristic (from Greek \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9 \"I find, discover\") is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. So as we know from the start, the system does have all the information. Fast simple routines that get the AI to appear to simulate the whole process might be convincing 99% of the time. And if they have trouble? The movement routine always gets stuck on a certain type of landscape? Remove that landscape. You can tweak the AI and the world till it works together without getting stuck or doing strange things. But of course the heuristic might be poor. Not everything gets done right. Deadlines exist. At 4am, surrounded by coke cans a bleary eyed programmer might decide that in order to deliver by 9am, the heuristic for \"does the enemy see the player?\" Is when they are within a radius of 40 feet around the AI. Such a system will immediately cause visible issues. In a big open area, the AI wont see the player until they are close. In a building, the enemy will spot you through walls and rush in. Wall hacking AI. The convincing ones are harder to write and sometimes still have weaknesses that get discovered by the gaming community over many iterations. It is worth noting that game AI is generally not *real* AI, which is a whole field of study regarding emulating things that happen in a human brain. The future for game AI is probably in trainable *real* AI."}]}

The wife of the previous king, George VI, was Queen Elizabeth, not Princess Elizabeth.", "output": [{"answer": "You might be interested in this, from [ URL_0 ](http://www. URL_0 /faqs/britfaq.html): What is the title of a Queen's husband? There are too few cases in English or British history to establish a rule. Here are the precedents: Matilda (d. 1167) should have succeeded her father Henry I in 1135 but a civil war broke out and she never effectively ruled, although the crown ultimately passed to her son. Thus the question of the style of her husband, Geoffrey Plantagenet, never really arose. Mary Tudor married in 1554 Philip, king of Naples. He became king of England and Ireland by right of his wife. Parliament was called in their names, acts are dated from the year of their joint reign. His reign ended with her death in 1558, as stipulated by the marriage contract and by act of Parliament (1 Mar I 3 c.2). Mary Stuart, queen of Scots, had two husbands who held the title of king: Fran\u00e7ois, dauphin then king of France, (d. 1560) and Henry Lord Darnley (d. 1567). Mary II and William III became queen and king jointly and each in his own right, by virtue of the Bill of Rights; after her death, he ruled in his own name. Thus, his title did not derive from being the husband of a queen. Anne's husband, prince George of Denmark, was created duke of Cumberland in 1689, before her accession. Victoria's husband received the title of Prince Consort in 1857. He never received a peerage. Elizabeth II's husband had been created duke of Edinburgh in 1947, before her accession. He was also made a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957. One can also note a near-miss: when George IV's daughter and heiress presumptive married prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a dukedom of Kendall was mooted for him, but he apparently turned it down. In short, no two husbands of queens were treated alike. However, it is unlikely that the case of Mary I's husband will arise again."}]}
{"id": "6qjg5i", "input": "Why do humans need pillows and what would happen if we slept without them on a regular basis? Would this cause long term spinal problems?", "output": [{"answer": "Edit 4: All the way at the top so you can read it first. Disclaimer: I am not a ~~doctor nor chiropractor~~ medical professional. While I do have some medical experience, I am in no way qualified to provide medical advice. I am simply sharing what training I've received and my personal experiences either with customers or what I've felt myself. I am doing this of my own free will at the low low price of... wait for it.. free. Yes that was a salesman joke. Now all comments I've expressed are opinionated. Please research this topic yourself before purchasing a mattress. Trust but verify. I currently work at a Colorado based Mattress Store. While you don't need a mattress or a pillow, it does wonders for hip, neck, back, and shoulder pains. A properly fitted mattress provides about 2/3rds of your support. The mattress in conjunction with the pillow provides the remaining 1/3rd. I feel that this support is necessary IF you want the best nights rest possible. You can still sleep without it but not optimally. The way it was explained in my training is as follows. A mattress that is actually fitted to your sleeping habits and body, reduces how much your muscles have to work throughout the night to maintain the natural S curve of your spine. If your muscles work hard throughout the night maintaining this position you tend to wake up with a tense back and/or back pain. The part the pillow plays is also quite important. An improperly fitted pillow typically causes neck pain due to similar reasons. The neck muscles work and are stretched throughout the night from the lack of support. Please note that this a very general statement and that every person is different as well as the mattress they sleep on. Many people will say that they sleep absolutely amazing on their current mattress that is 40 years old (no exaggeration, true story). However, I used to think that Motorola Razr was the best phone ever. Then I tried something new, the Samsung Note. To be clear, my point is that just because you feel something is the best you've ever experienced doesn't mean you can't experience something better. Bonus (A few general mattress rules) : If you are a side sleeper try to avoid firm mattresses. They place a lot of pressure on your shoulders and hips with very little give. This leads to more tossing and turning throughout the night (even if you aren't completely awake/aware). Adjustable bases, sometimes called hospital beds, are used in hospitals for a reason. They reduce pressure on your body by forming a S curve to help match your spine's curve. Also, they raise your feet above your heart causing increased blood flow to facilitate healing. Why do you think doctors tell you to keep certain injuries elevated? In regards to pillows, most stomach sleepers need a thin pillow. Side sleepers often need the thickest. The reason for that relates to your shoulders. The pillow needs to be about as thick as the distance from your neck to the edge of your shoulder so that the neck is in line with spine. Back sleepers are often needing something in the middle. Although almost every customer claims to need the fluffiest fluffernugget of a pillow we have. Very few of them will listen otherwise. So we sell it to them. The customer is always right. No matter how ridiculously wrong they are. Edit 1: A lot of people have asked about the best pillow for someone who switches between their stomach and side throughout the night. There isn't a specific pillow or really even a best one. What works for me may not work for you. However this is what I personally do: What worked for me, and **might** work for you is this. I purchased a thin pillow that I was comfortable with on my stomach. Now, most side sleepers end up having an arm underneath the pillow essentially \"increasing\" the thickness of the pillow to match a so called side sleeper pillow. This worked for me. My arm made up for the missing padding. Again, this is what is good for me. Edit 2: There has been a fair amount of skepticism regarding the increased blood flow portion of this comment. The medical field is slightly outside my area of knowledge. However, while I am not currently retracting this statement, I am going to research a little more in depth. Hopefully I come back with a more satisfactory explanation. Edit 3: Wow. Um. Gold. Huh. I really appreciate that! Truly! *obligatory first gold comment followed by lame pun* Edit 5: There's been a lot more interest on this subject than I expected. I've answered most of the questions at least once, some more. If I haven't addressed yours, the answer may be in another comment. Tonight however, I'm turning in. I may be able to answer some tomorrow morning. Past that, I feel like the subject was been pretty well exhausted. I do wish I every a excellent night's rest! Good night! Edit 6: Editing the edit. I get it, a lot of people don't like chiropractors."}]}
{"id": "3h4llq", "input": "How does a touchscreen work?", "output": [{"answer": "The top answer is a great ELI5, but I'll see if I can go into more details while keeping it simple. So the most common form of touchscreens these days is \"capacitive\" touchscreens. What does that mean? That they use capacitors! Now capacitors are this weird thing where you can store electricity in two things that are *close but not touching*. The classical example is two metal plates separated by air. It turns out that the electric field between them can store energy, and the closer they are together, the more energy they store. The \"plates\" don't have to be metal, though, they can be anything conductive. Like skin! So what your phone has is a bunch of half-capacitors. It has only one of the two conductive plates, and those plates are hidden behind the screen. The magic comes when you use your finger to be the *other half* of the capacitor! So remember how I said that the closer the plates are to each other, the more energy they store? Your phone is constantly charging/discharging its plates (it has a big grid of them), and figuring out which take more energy to charge. Because the ones that take more energy have something conductive near them (your finger)! As I said earlier, there's no contact between the two plates, so you don't have to be touching your phone for it to sense your finger. It's just calibrated at the factory so that you're *most likely* touching it when it notices a \"tap\". Likewise, other conductive things will work. Sausages are a good example, but metal coins will work too (careful about scratching your screen, though). They really are a pretty cool piece of technology, I hope this explanation helped."}]}
{"id": "1fl7kl", "input": "The Turkish Protests", "output": [{"answer": "To understand why the protests are happening, you need to understand some of the history of Turkey as a nation, and the Ottoman Empire before it. To understand the Ottoman Empire, you need to understand the Islamic concept of a caliphate. So, here goes: In the Islamic world, there has always been the concept of a \"caliph,\" which in Arabic means \"successor\"\u2013 a successor to Muhammad. Sometimes, people think of a caliph like a \"Muslim Pope,\" which isn't really accurate. The concept of a caliphate and a caliph isn't tied to any particular region. Instead, the idea is that the Caliph represents all Muslims, and has the authority to speak for them. In the most basic terms, it's a symbol of where power in the Islamic world rests at any given time. Here's where the Ottoman Empire comes in. As one of the most powerful states in the world for a few centuries, it was natural that the Caliphate was based in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, for most of that time. It's for this reason that the Ottoman Empire is often considered the fourth (and last) caliphate. Now comes Turkey. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and the war's victors were already circling like vultures, ready to pick apart Ottoman territory. However, there was a guy named Mustafa Kemal (or Ataturk, meaning father of all Turks)\u2013 he is basically the George Washington of Turkey, and it was with his leadership that Turkey managed to survive as a single state. Here's the catch: Ataturk also established a strong tradition of secularism in the Turkish state, and he *abolished the caliphate.* Ataturk had seen how a reliance on Islamic thought had stifled the technological advancement of the once-great Ottoman Empire. He felt that to adequately \"westernize\" Turkey, he had to do away with the state religion. This choice upset a lot of people, and still does. The current reigning party in Turkey comes from strongly Islamic roots, which also rubs people the wrong way\u2013 it seems to fly in the face of Ataturk's memory. Much of Turkish political history since then can be viewed as the struggle between Western secularism and the Islamic thought of the Ottomans. Given everything I've just told you, it should make a lot more sense why people got so mad about the bulldozing of a park to put up a replica Ottoman barracks\u2013 a symbol of Islamic military might. True, there was also a shopping mall, but ask any Turk, and they will tell you: the protests are about much more than a shopping mall. They are about the Turkish people's right to secularism, and about their right not to be swaddled in state-sponsored Islam. **tl;dr: The Ottoman Empire was Islamic, Ataturk made sure that Turkey was definitely not. The conflict is about bulldozing a public park to put up an Ottoman barracks, a symbol with strong Islamic connotations. Also, shopping malls.**"}]}
{"id": "3rgpee", "input": "What's the reason for the perpetual raising of awareness for breast cancer? Is there some commercial benefit? Does anyone out there really not know about it at this point?", "output": [{"answer": "I'll say something other than the conspiracies (however much truth there may be) here. Awareness is so much more than making someone aware of beat cancers mere existence. Awareness is about knowing and recognizing the signs in yourself and others, so that the disease can be detected early, and thus be more easily treated. For example, I bet most people who have heard of breast cancer haven't heard of Inflammatory Breast Cancer. It's a rare form of breast cancer that forms in sheets instead of lumps. By the time it's detectable as a misshapen breast, is usually already at stage 4. Another example is that men can and do get breast cancer. Most men don't realize this, and would have absolutely no idea how to monitor for it. That's another part of awareness: knowing who is at risk. Most people only know that lumps = breast cancer. But there are many kinds that manifest in different ways. Awareness helps (or should) people understand more about the disease, not just make them aware that it exists. This should be the case for most cancers, but breast cancer gained traction due to its prevalence in modern America, and organizations like SGK getting the word out. P.S. Try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when talking about breast cancer awareness. There are shady people trying to profit off it, sure, but there are also a lot of people out there who this cause is very important to, and are trying to help with nothing but the best intentions. My sisters and I are considering starting a charity for IBC awareness and research, in honor of our mother who died from it. We've already hosted a few fundraisers whose proceeds were donated to the American Cancer Society. There are people out there trying to help. I'm one of them. TL;DR: Awareness means knowing who is at risk, why, and recognizing signs of multiple forms of the disease. It's not meant to simply make you aware of the diseases existence."}]}

First off, when you purse your lips and blow, you're limiting the amount of air you can expel at once. When you say HAAA you can expel your entire lung capacity in a second or two, whereas with WHOO it takes a bit longer depending on how tight you purse your lips. This air has the same temperature either way, so when you WHOO you put out less energy per second than when you HAAA. This isn't the whole explanation, though. Put your finger really close to your lips and WHOO. Feels warm, right? When you WHOO, the air stream is small. That stream has just been forced through a small opening and is ready to expand. Due to something called the [Joule-Thomson Effect]( URL_0 ), that stream of non-ideal gas cools as it expands. It only cools to room temperature because our \"valve\" in this case isn't well-insulated, so now you have a room-temperature stream of air moving past your hand.

That stream of room-temperature air absorbs energy from your skin and keeps going, making your hand feel \"cool\"."}]}

It doesn't matter if you're city, county, or state employed. Its not a heirarchy per se. Rather that each entity has a different function. Cities typically have better funding and are made as cities have bigger needs. Counties have less, but have larger jurisdictions. While it may seem that doesn't make sense, it does, if you think about it in that most of the populace is in cities. Counties are usually rural with less demand. Unincorporated areas typically take up most of their time. State police are stationed usually with a responsibility for a few counties, but there are less of them in any given area. State troopers primarily work highways, as they often enter/exit cities and counties. This works as those agencies have responsibilities to their city/counties, and highways cross jurisdictions easily. Also, some state police are game warden, dealing with specific wildlife law in a few counties. Leading me to my next point. Federal agents... first think of how city, county, state cops are stationed. Usually they have districts within their jurisdictions. City has sectors theyre assigned to patrol, same as county, and state with their multi county, they don't all just freely patrol the land. Although they can, and sometimes do if they get bored. Now... federal agents get assigned to an area in a state. Technically, as the city cops have state authority, these agents have national authority. However, they still have an area within a state that they're typically assigned responsibility to work in. Also, federal law and state law is different. They actually have separate constitutions and rights.. go read your state constitution... with that said, the federal agents have significantly less scope than a city cop for example... I'll explain. A city cop has city ordinances (local laws ie. Don't skateboard here) as well as any county law (no fireworks), and the regular state laws. In contrast, federal may have a very specific law set that they deal with, but can enforce that law set over a vast area. (Nationally) when needed. They work together with other agents stationed all over different areas. One is not necessarily better or higher up than the other. They all work with different responsibilities. They all work together, with joint efforts, task forces, and work to share information as needed. It's important to note that federal cops cannot enforce state law and vice versa. For example, marijuana. Currently under federal law marijuana is illegal. A state cannot make it legal. States can however, remove their state law making it illegal, thereby \"decriminializing\". This is different than \"legalize\". A state cannot contradict a federal law, although states can make stricter laws. And a city can make stricter laws than a state law. It goes downward so to speak."}]}

What do they stand to gain when they're already a household name?", "output": [{"answer": "If you pay attention to it, only a small amount of Coke marketing is actually intended to promote their umbrella brand. Instead they focus more on individual product brands (e.g. Coke Zero, Fanta, etc.). While Coca-Cola maybe well known, individual products and their \"positioning\" (summary of product characteristics, intended target group, benefits, etc.) may still benefit from increased awareness. Additionally marketing and branding isn\u00b4t all about awareness, that\u00b4s just the first part of the purchase funnel (Awareness -- >  Image -- >  Consideration -- >  Purchase -- >  Repurchase), they also want to promote a certain image. This image may change over the years, even if the name and logo doesn\u00b4t or it may be under attack from outside reevaluations. So even a well-known umbrella brand is marketed to re-enforce and maybe update their brand image. Lastly, Coke is a consumption good with relatively low involvement (small investments, no long-term effects of purchase decision, etc.) unlike, e.g. a car for example. So people often decide relatively spontaneous about which brand and whether to buy at all. That\u00b4s why it\u00b4s more important for Coke to promote themselves constantly than it is for a brand like GE. However we shouldn\u00b4t discount that many companies actually do invest in marketing activities that aren\u00b4t really helpful to them. Not every company investing in brand awareness has done the research and pinpointed brand awareness as their key lever to address. Most often marketing activities that promote the brand awareness are just the easiest and most salient measure to do for many marketing departments."}]}

Your ISP provides a basic connection at the media layers: simply passing bits around, and routing. That is usually all. However, most people think in terms of the host layers. \"I am downloading this file in Chrome and it says I get X bytes/sec.\" That translates to 8X bits per second. However, that is using TCP/IP: the raw number of bits your connection can provide are not all dedicated to the contents of that file you are transferring. TCP adds overhead: each packet has timestamps and checksums, so the client knows if a packet is corrupt or was received out of order. Acknowledgement packets are sent in both directions. All of these consume bits. Going back to your question, this is more of a perception issue than anything. Data pipes are generally measured in the number of bits they can transfer because that is what they do. Even the concept of a \"byte\" may be foreign to the physical layer in OSI, for example. People think in terms of bytes, because that is what their web browsers report when transferring files. A byte is the smallest addressable entity in computer memory, and files on a disk are measured in bytes, not bits. Humans are trained to think in bytes. However, overhead ensures that the number of bits at the physical layer of the network is not simply eight times the number of bytes transferred at the application layer. If we started advertising speeds in bytes and classifying connections using bytes, it would _never_ match what people actually see in web browsers or SFTP clients. While it is possible to measure network speeds in terms of bytes, it would not really help anything and could add confusion."}]}

What standards are in place to ensure that LEO's correctly interpret the law at any other time? I know it is taking this issue to a hyperbolic level, but what is to stop an officer from shooting you for running a stop sign? Technically, by doing so, you ARE endangering the lives of others, can he misinterpret that as cause to use lethal force? I'd like to think this is well outside the realm of possibility, but with some of the recent police shootings to make the news, I wouldn't actually be too surprised. Could the Heien case be cited as precedent? I think part of what OC was asking, and what concerns me personally, is not just if a LEO misinterprets a law, but arrests you for something that is not even illegal, something where there is not even a law to misinterpret. For instance: 1) There are numerous instances of photographers being arrested for taking pictures in public. There are mountains of case files saying that photography is a protected first amendment right, yet photographers are arrested daily. Granted the cases are almost always dropped, but where is the compensation for the time the photographer has now spent in jail waiting to be released? Where is the compensation for having his equipment confiscated and often damaged in the process? Where is the protection for the photographer's copyrighted work that has often been accessed and/or deleted by LEO's? Where is the compensation for the legal fees to get a lawyer to represent you and get the photographer released? Where is the compensation for the photographer's reputation? Yes, you can sue the police department in a civil action, but that involves lots of time and lawyers which gets even more expensive, and as often as not, is drawn out by the police departments for so long that most cases are dropped or settled for a paltry sum. Very little substantive punitive action is ever taken in these cases even though it is a clearly legal activity that photographers are being regularly arrested for. 2) Deliberate arrest on charges the police know will not stick just to be punitive, coercive, or to carry on with activities that are already extralegal. For instance, most of the Occupy Wall Street protesters who were arrested had their charges dropped after being arrested. They were arrested and transported away from the scene just to get them out of the way and make it inconvenient for them to continue the protest. Or, the Ferguson protestors who were told they would be arrested if they so much as stopped stopped moving on the sidewalk long enough to tie their shoes. Or, the lawyer, [Jami Tillotson]( URL_0 ), who was arrested in San Francisco for resiting arrest (you read that correctly, she was arrested for resisting arrest) by attempting to not allow her clients to be interrogated without representation by a large contingent of police officers in the open hallway of a courthouse. She was released soon afterwards, but the tactic worked, she was removed from the scene, prevented from performing her legally and constitutionally protected job, and the police got to continue what was at best a VERY questionably legal interrogation."}]}

How can I sit in a ~200\u00b0 F sauna and not get burned, but water the same temperature spilled on my arm will burn and blister my skin?", "output": [{"answer": "Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another. First, water has high heat capacity. That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy. So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS. The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it. Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster. Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer. For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water. Should go alot faster in the water. tl;dr - Water has more energy in a smaller space and transfers that energy much faster."}]}

The arabic style of clothing is better at trapping in colder air, so it'll actually be more like 110 degrees fahrenheit even though it's a 120 degrees fahrenheit. Most of the world doesn't need heavy suits or Arabic style clothing to live, so some groups adopted the Western clothing because it felt more comfortable/easier to wear. Also, it's because most of Europe tried to make colonies like literally everywhere in the world except for the Arabian peninsula. For example, take the Phillipines, it has gone through many European controls since it's beginning. Another reason would be that you would want other nations to take you seriously. I mean, if you didn't have a shirt, and you had a robe as your pants, it would be quite awkward in a serious argument or discussion. The last reason would be religion, and tradition.

{"id": "4an84y", "input": "How can tumors be removed surgically if the tumor's exact borders/perimeters can only be seen with a microscope?", "output": [{"answer": "The correct answer is 'it depends what you mean by tumour'. A benign (non-cancer) tumour is slow growing and unlikely to spread after surgery. The chances of there being microscopic cells outside of the 'macroscopic' (visible to the naked eye) tumour are small. Many of these tumours will also have a 'capsule' around of them of non-tumorous tissue which can be either left in place or incompletely removed without the tumour coming back. Others will have what we call a 'plane' around them - a space that divides them from healthy tissues and lets us pop them out. Think of peeling the skin off a chicken breast - that's using the 'plane' between muscle and skin in the same way. Another example is the 'plane' between the skin of an orange or banana and the fruit inside. Body tissues work a similar way. Despite this, benign tumours can still come back if they are not completely removed, so often some of the tissue around them is taken too. For large benign tumours we can't always be certain there isn't cancer inside, so the entire organ may be removed (eg testicles, ovaries). For cancer it's a bit different. The cancer is likely to have spread outside the visible lump, sometimes by a long way. In bowel surgery (my speciality), we need to see the healthy bowel around the tumour, the blood vessels and the lymph nodes to decide whether the cancer has spread. So for example in a rectal cancer, we take some or all of the rectum, the fat around the rectum, and blood vessels and lymph nodes going into the abdomen. Much of that tissue doesn't have cancer in it, but it is important to know how much does to decide on whether chemotherapy will be of benefit and the likely risk of tumour spread and recurrence. ELI5 answer - we take healthy cells too, quite often a shitload of them. Source - bowel surgeon. TL;DR - bananas, cancer, bum surgery."}]}
{"id": "4749i2", "input": "How did they build Medieval bridges in deep water?", "output": [{"answer": "The Roman architect Vitruvius tells us that in order to lay the foundations and supporting pillars the Romans would construct water tight vessels, rather like barrels. These were made of wood bound by metal. In order to provide water resistance the barrels could be lined with pitch or clay. By lowering these into the river it was then possible to divert the water from the place of work in order to dig down to build foundations. The foundations could be lain directly onto hard rock if it was found or onto wooden piles driven deep into the river bed. This last solution is relatively durable as is demonstrated by the result achieved with Venice. The wet mud and the lack of oxygen prevents the action of the bacteria which would in other cases destroy the wood. Once the foundations had been laid the bottom portion of the pillar could be built within the \"barrel\" and from there brought up to the required height above the water level by means of scaffolding. As already described, the arches would be built by creating a truss to support the work until the arch had been spanned. The Romans were also VERY good at pouring concrete underwater. In fact, as far as resiliency against wear and resistance to crushing, their concrete was hands down better than modern concrete. One doesn't often think about concrete being able to cure underwater, but it works perfectly fine, albeit it takes a lot longer."}]}

Eliminate the entire income and payroll tax code. Replace it with about a 40% flat tax on all earned income. No loopholes, no deductions, no nothing.

These loans were then bundled all together with other loans, and loan rating agencies were giving these bundles a better than deserved rating. This allowed the bank to sell these bundled loans for more than they were worth. So many banks did this and sold them to each other that they all ended up with big chunks of \"toxic debt\" - loans that had a high chance of default that the banks had overpayed for because of the favorable ratings. Once this practice reached a critical point, it started to unravel. People began to default on their loans, which lowered the value of the bundles of loans that banks had sold each other. Furthermore, the increased number of forclosed and vacated homes made the housing prices drop, which also hurt the value of these loan bundles. The whole thing became a huge snowball, and these banks were so deep into it that they ended up with so much toxic debt on their books that they would have had to declare bankruptcy to clear it. If these big banks collapsed, it would send massive shockwaves through the global economy (theoretically orders of magnitude worse than what we saw) and so the US government stepped in to buy this toxic debt at a higher price than what it was worth. I tried to not include motivations in the above explanation to keep it simple. Ultimately, the individuals in these banks and companies that were responsible for the mess were getting huge rewards for pushing these loans on families that couldn't afford them, rating the bundles better than they should have been, and selling these bundles for more than they were worth. These people didnt lose that money when it all collapsed, they just walked away. Additionally, i didnt include some of the more nuanced issues like the impacts on the loan markets, which rippled out into non banking sectors of the econony, or the secondary markets like derivatives and shorts that all served to muddy the waters and make it very hard for regulators to figure the whole thing out, even if they had tried to.

Where as in traditional Japanese society the businessman is the lowest social class, even lower than the farmers, he was higher in western standards. It was now undignified for women to to top less working in the fields or in the fields at all, traditional clothes were disrespectful and the Western suit became more and more prevalent. Side point. One of these customs was underwear, especially ~sexy~ underwear. Regular woman couldn't afford underwear and only those that had money could. One of those that could were high class prostitutes which is where the interest with panties come from, because they were a sexual thing. Western values which were still deeply tied to religion said anything sexual was bad which is where censored porn comes from. Slowly Japanese culture was eroded as western norms took over. Now Japan has always had a sense of superiority that can still be seen to this day with the dislike of outsiders. The end of WWII with them losing took them down a notch and stuck deep in the hearts of the people. Now the US did help rebuild the country and yet again their culture was being worn away by foreigners. The working very hard to do the best you can was instilled after WWII as a way to rebuild the country by Americans. All along the way the people have fought back against the invading cultures. --- Now back to the main point. Japan has always been a fishing nation, relying on it because there's very little arable land, and whaling is, to an extent, just large fishing. The refusal to stop whaling is a massive \"fuck you, I won't do what you tell me\" to the world. For centuries the Japanese have basically been told that their culture was wrong and this is how you should do things and this is a protest on a national level effectively. Side point. If you read the background this is also why porn is censored, they were already forced to adopt the culture of sexuality=wrong and they refuse to change it again just because the west now deem it acceptable. --- Edit. While just a film and should be treat lightly you can actually see a lot of this in the film The Last Samurai."}]}
{"id": "2p01qz", "input": "Why don't Americans have the lowest medical costs in the world... is it a failure of the free market or government intervention or something else?", "output": [{"answer": "I work as a physician, currently in Canada, previously in the USA. Also, the American healthcare system was the focus of my major in university. I'll have troubles explaining like you're five, but anyway, here's my answer: 1) The free market works well WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO SHOP AROUND. If you're looking for socks, you'll look for the best quality at the most reasonable price. You can't do that with healthcare-- nobody at the hospital will be able to tell you how much your care costs until you get the bill. Trust me-- patients have asked me how much a test costs, and I honestly don't have a clue. You can't shop around, and hospitals know that, so there is no limit to what they charge their customers. I've seen one patient charged $19.00 for a single Tylenol tablet, plus $7.00 \"nurse\" fee for bringing it to the patient, plus a $15.00 \"administration\" fee for the nurse having to get the tablet and water. 2) There are many uninsured/underinsured Americans. ERs, though, are required to treat everyone, regardless of insurance. A person with no insurance gets treated, gets a bill for $10,000, the bill goes unpaid, the hospital gets stiffed. So, the hospital makes up for it by \"cost-shifting\", and they charge more for the services that ARE usually paid for, things like colonoscopies (covered by insurance). This drives health INSURANCE costs upwards. So, costs become lower for everyone when everyone is insured. 3) Someone else mentioned that doctors have to practice in such a way to avoid being sued, so we order tons of unnecessary tests. I wouldn't agree. Here in Canada, we're not nearly as worried about being sued, yet we still order tests in order to make sure we're not missing a more serious diagnosis. Practicing medicine in the States vs Canada is really not that different. The threat of being sued does not drive up healthcare costs as much as Republicans would like you to believe. I say that because tort reform seems to be the Republican party's only idea for lowering healthcare costs, but it's virtually useless. 4) Someone mentioned that government regulation drives prices up. That's partially true, but keep in mind that the purpose of the government regulation is to avoid unethical practices. For instance, the EMTALA law requires emergency rooms to treat people that come in, regardless of insurance. Could you imagine what it would be like if they turned everyone away that had no insurance? Very unethical. 5) Americans have come to accept that healthcare is expensive and that there's nothing that can be done about it. That's not true. Many other nations (including Canada) are providing an equal or greater level of healthcare at less than half the cost. 6) Many Americans (mostly older Americans) are still suffering from Cold War-era propaganda. They are under the impression that anything socialised is the same as Communism, and therefore, socialization is evil. Many Americans don't understand that the police force, public libraries, firehalls, public roads, and public schools are all socialized services. They're funded by the government because they're viewed as necessary services. Wouldn't it be terrible if your local police force would only protect people who paid a monthly premium? Healthcare is considered (by many nations) to be a necessary service, which is why the government funds them. This is the definition of socialism-- when the public (government) controls or funds an entity. Many Americans are under the impression that once the government takes over healthcare, then healthcare will suffer. We in Canada had that same debate about 40 years ago when considering to move to a public system, yet look at us now-- we would never go back to a market-based system. Hope some of those points made sense!"}]}
{"id": "39wbpu", "input": "Why do some video games alt-tab quickly and other's take ages or even crash trying to reopen?", "output": [{"answer": "I can answer the first part of this question. Windows has two fullscreen modes: borderless window and dedicated. Older games generally used dedicated fullscreen because it gives full control of the screen to the game. When resources were significantly lower (power of the GPU if there even was a GPU), having complete control helped squeeze out every little bit of power you could. Switching out of the game via alt-tab will force the game to lose control of the screen and give it back to Windows. This can cause flickering, screen resizing, and in some cases (such as Source games) crash. Borderless windows are completely different. They are as you expect, simply a window within Windows that has the chrome (title bar, exit button, borders) removed. This means that to tab out of a game, you don't need to do anything fancy or invasive since the game is just another window. This allows Windows to keep control of the screen which makes your game have a little less available to it in terms of resources but since GPUs are so damn powerful these days (even Intel HD chips are noteworthy) it's not really an issue. The biggest disadvantage in using borderless windows is that you cannot enable true vsync, you must rely on Windows' ability to properly sync output with your screen's refresh rate to ensure no tearing occurs. Games that allow you to enable vsync even in window borderless mode simply lock the FPS to your refresh rate and hope Windows performs as intended. Edit: Some people have suggested that a possible answer to OP's original question (if we ignore borderless windows) could be a difference in DirectX 9 and 10+, where handling the switch to and from exclusive control might be automated now where in the past developers had to handle this switch manually (to varying levels of success). Another possible answer might be that the way the game manages resources could affect how it handles tabbing. Anecdotally, I will suggest that I've heard my hard disk spin up when I tab to and from some fullscreen games that might suggest that some data is being dumped to the disk which would definitely slow things down."}]}
{"id": "2sdkyv", "input": "Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high?", "output": [{"answer": "The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire. Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load/combustibles). The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required. When designers are tasked to create 'open space', regardless of low or high ceilings, larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased, thus 'opening' the space. However, this is not always the case, such as in multi-story structures where significant weight/loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing (e.g., airports, parking ramps, hotels). Operating costs do tend to be higher, but it is a trade off on the desired space/affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense. Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects, so the owner/operator knows early-on what to expect. These factors also contribute to changes in a design if costs are deemed to be unreasonable or exceeding targets/goals. Source: Engineer by day, Firefighter by night.

However, it is a skill that requires a framework to be most effective. Speech is very similar--We start making sounds long before we understand what any of them mean, but little by little we build that framework so we understand word meanings, word order, spelling, and pronunciation. Much like how we must crawl and walk before we can run, we must babble and play with letter blocks before language makes sense. Let's try a magic trick. Hear me out: A fully-fledged language must, among other things, be able to discuss things that are not present (pointing at something and making noises isn't quite language, but it's heading in that direction). Imagine a tree. It will almost certainly be a single brown stalk leading up to a puffball of green. Let's take it one step further: Imagine a pine tree. The amorphous, tree-like smudge has taken on better definition--still a single stalk, but the greenery is triangular, serrated/terraced. Let's take it even further: Touch your nose. (This example works better in person; it's much easier to be obstinate on the internet). If you actually touched your nose, then I caused you to hallucinate two distinct images and move your body *with the power of language alone*. For my magic trick to work, however, you need to have all that framework where \"tree,\" \"pine,\" \"imagine,\" \"touch,\" \"nose,\" and \"your\" all makes sense. This takes exposure, practice, and time. The neat thing, though, is that exposure to multiple languages can be beneficial to children, contrary to decades of focus on monolingual education in America. But that gets a bit complicated, so the short version is this: Language is magic, because sounds and pictures become other sounds and pictures in your mind."}]}

People don't think they are very \"grown up\". Whether or not it matters to you is, well, up to you, but do understand that the impression you give people impacts how they treat you. I am not saying that it's right, but it happens.

They are basically impossible to break, thanks to how much they change shape, but we might not always be happy with how they change shape in response to pressures (see Trump). On the other hand dictatorships are like blocks of glass. You press on them and they don't move, they don't flex. Instead the pressure builds up inside them.

Normally as the hair grows, those cells inject a colour into the hair, but when they eventually die off in some body regions as most people (and dogs) age, they're not there any more to inject the dye, so the growing hair becomes essentially fingernail-clipping coloured.

When you swipe it, the machine reads those codes and then charges your account. Here's the catch, if the machine can read it, a bad machine can be programmed to copy the codes. A criminal can then make their own card with your information and use it. Think of your credit card like a book with all your codes/information. When you swipe it, it is like giving this book to someone to look it. If they're a good person, they just look at it and make sure it is your account. If they're up to no good, they will look at it, and make a copy of your book, so they can pretend they are you. So again, the card doesn't matter. It is the information on the card. Once they get that information, they can print their own card with your information and can be used. Now there are several security measures in place to help prevent this. 1. New cards have a 'chip' What this means is the information on the card changes. So right now, a code might have a value of 10. an hour later, it will have a value of 50. It makes it much harder to copy. If they just do a simple copy, they will only copy the 10. Their copy won't work an hour later. 2. Credit card companies do try and check purchases. So if they see a transaction in places 500 km away within 20 minutes... they could probably flag. Different credit card companies have different levels of security and technology to detect this. But they're working on it. Just a note. Often times, security can by be bypassed for convenience. For example, your credit work will still work even if the store is not connected to the credit card company.

{"id": "3nd1re", "input": "Why is it such a concern when Russia fights ISIS in the middle east but when the US do it(along with other things in the area), no one gives a damn.", "output": [{"answer": "Because it challenges U.S. hegemony. The United States likes to try to control areas with instability, because gaining footholds increases their scope, influence, and power. During the cold war, the United States was incredibly concerned about the influence of communism over the rest of the world, because it is at odds with capitalism and the United States way of life. The Soviet Union's brand of totalitarianism just didn't fit with the United State's brand of totalitarianism. After the U.S. \"won\" the cold war, the Russian bear went dormant and struggled to find itself and it's place in world domination. Now-a-days, the bear is trying to spread its wings, and this challenges the domination the United States has over the rest of the world. Unstable Middle Eastern and African regions are supposed to be controlled by the United States, and any intrusion into that control is going to be met with hostility. So in summary, it's basically about the U.S. controlling the world, and having that control challenged. Areas of instability are areas of economic opportunity for the United States, both government and corporate entities. If the United States can establish a dominant presence in a region, they can sell military equipment, and McDonald's to the fledgling beta powers in those regions. Russia getting involved in Syria is like Burger King getting their shit together and putting out a decent burger, and promoting the hell out of it. They're bombing the people that are like the United State's McDonalds marketers. The U.S. wants McDonald's to seize control of the airwaves from the evil Taco Bell, but Russia is challenging that air time with their own marketers. Customers have to be coerced into eating someone's garbage, and both Russia and the United States are determined to be the hand that feeds."}]}
{"id": "saiq9", "input": "why is it easy to balance a moving two-wheeler?", "output": [{"answer": "check out this paper:  URL_0  I did my final year engineering project partially on bicycle stability. This is a linearized model, so it does make some simplifying assumptions, but I think it does a good job of pointing out the nature and complexity of the truth. (we're getting pretty far away from an explanation a five year old can understand at this point) It's just highly complex. If you don't understand multivariable differential equations and systems theory, you're going to have a bad time understanding what keeps a bicycle upright. It stays up because of a complex, coupled relationship between (principally) three variables along with physical properties of the bike: steering angle, leaning angle, velocity, and the various masses and moments of inertia of the parts. Simply writing down Newton's law (F=ma) and the conservation of angular momentum yields a big fat second order linear multivariable differential equation of these variables. The most interesting part of this vector equation emerges when the equation is eigendecomposed--that is, the variables are grouped in new proportions with each other to produce a similar vector (representing the same variables) but is treated nicely by the matrices in the equation. These vectors, which are combinations of the three variables, represent the coupled modes of motion that the bike undergoes. The death wobble is a phenomenon most people encounter at some point when riding a bike. The death wobble is an eigenvector--it's a time-dependent combination of the three variables which satisfies the differential equation. This is necessarily a complex eigenvalue because it is an oscillating mode. The real part of the eigenvector dictates whether the magnitude of the oscillations increases (positive feedback) or decreases (negative feedback). Here's a video of a death wobble increasing in magnitude  URL_3  Here's a video of it decreasing in magnitude  URL_2  This is a good example of a self stable bicycle. (It's in the second half of the video) So it's about the real part of the eigenvalue. This dictates whether oscillations will amplify, or decay over time. When the real part is negative, perturbations from stability tend to decay back to stable, when they're positive, perturbations from stability tend to amplify. Here are the eigenvalues vs. bicycle velocity:  URL_1  Past the point where they're all negative, the bike is self-stable edit: clarification edit2: that is not my paper"}]}

Yes, i worked the first FOUR years of my engineering career at a factory in rural America that produced approximately 2 million pounds of unsliced turkey deli meat per week. I still work for one of the largest producer of turkey in the world. The answer almost exclusively boils down to economics. Turkey is a lower cost protein to make than chicken (by a small margin...but feed inputs are roughly 70% of the cost of poultry and turkeys are more efficient feed converters. Every little bit counts here). On top of this turkey is incredibly seasonal. Thanksgiving, christmas, and to a lesser extent easter are when turkey producers make their money and spend the rest of the year trying not to lose it. You cant just turn on the giant industro-ag machine that is turkey production for three holidays so production must remain relatively stable year round. People dont buy whole turkeys throughout the year so producers have to get creative. Enter turkey bacon, burgers, and.....deli breast! Essentially...if you want reasonably priced thanksgiving and christmas turkeys...the industry has to find creative ways to sell it year round....the white goes to deli, dark goes to ham, bacon, and burgers. If you have any other questions i would be happy to answer! Poultry is my life! Currently working at a large cooked chicken plant (edited to remove a customer reference...don't want to get make anyone mad...i can't/won't be able to answer questions about specific customers or products) Edit to add a few other economic factors...turkey takes substantially longer to grow than chicken so contracts on pricing are easier to secure. Chicken grows in weeks...so your contract price might look great the first flock...but feed prices change rapidly and if you lock in a year contract on chicken you could be getting screwed. Also, there are higher margin outlets for chicken breast than deli meat. Restaurants dont want to serve turkey because its slow to cook...chicken is fast and with high margins...chicken breasts are incredibly popular at the meat case for grilling. If you can get it in your store, buy a raw turkey tenderloin to marinate and grill! Best cut of meat to grill bar a ribeye! Edit a second time to say thanks for the gold.

My sleep apnea history goes back at least twenty years, I was always the guy accused of snoring loud, but as a typical guy I ignored it.

My buddy just spent the night on my couch, and when I asked him what I sounded like during a nap after some running around, he said it was just normal snoring (without the machine) and not the obnoxious hell I was experiencing before. I can only tell you my opinion about how other things changed for me, because I am only relating my own experience. That being said, I do this because even going through the diagnosis, my HMO did very little to educate me, and I was pretty much on my own. What I know/believe is this: you body has stuff to do while you are asleep. Stuff like repairing the day's damage, digesting dinner, letting your immune system work on things, probably other things I'm not aware of. When you don't sleep right, none of this stuff happens right either. I had constant digestion problems, frequent trips to the bathroom which made air travel a bit nervous and uncomfortable. Think about experiencing the urge to go in a long security line. Also I had nearly constant heartburn. I sure as hell rarely had the energy to work out, so I blossomed in weight. My blood pressure sucked, my cholesterol sucked, etcetera, etcetera. The device hasn't been my only lifestyle change, but it was the change that made the others possible. These days, my tummy is much better in all regards, I get sick less often, I have a highly active dog who gets frequent long hikes at the river. BTW, now that I do all that hiking on uneven terrain, my tendency to twist my ankles is gone. I have lost weight, gained muscle, I have the energy for active hobbies, and everything is better. Yes, now I depend on a medical device for proper sleep, but I think it's less invasive than accomplishing my goal by getting cut on or by putting a chemical into my body. TL;DR: Sleep apnea will frikkin kill you. It creates a snowball of bad that feeds upon itself and makes things worser more fasterer. Now that I have conquered sleep apnea, the snowball is rolling the other way and I am in far better shape at 46 than I was at 38. If you are the guy who snores loud and is tired all the time, get that shit checked out, PLEASE."}]}
{"id": "2b0l56", "input": "Why are banks only open during the most inconvenient hours?", "output": [{"answer": "I\u2019ll try to give both the short-winded answer and a long-winded answer. As a bit of background, I\u2019m an individual who worked in retail banking through school (for business, then changed to engineering), then stayed (probably shouldn\u2019t have, but I did). I\u2019ve been in banking about 11 years now. First in a small bank that was bought by a bigger bank that was bought by a bigger bank, and now in a small bank that became a mid-sized bank through growth. I\u2019ve held numerous positions from teller to management and now work in commercial real estate (on the banking side). TL;DR: The \u201cELI5\u201d answer, as some others have pointed out, is that banks are businesses and its biggest customers are other businesses. Thus, they need to be open when other businesses are open. If ELI5 is exactly what you want and don\u2019t want any more information, stop reading now. To fully understand why banks are open certain hours, you have to look at how banks make (and spend) their money. This is likely going to appear long-winded, but it\u2019s really simplified version of what happens, and mostly only on the retail side. The \u201ceasy button\u201d version of how banks make their money is that they lend money to people and businesses and collect a fee up front (for some loans) as well as collect interest. The money the banks lend to people comes from a couple places. The bank can borrow it from another entity (the federal home loan bank, for example). The bank then has a \u201cspread\u201d over that loan, which the bank keeps for itself. The other main avenue is deposits that the bank holds for its deposit customers. This one can be a bit less \u201ccut and dry,\u201d so you may want to hang on for a second, but I\u2019ll try to explain it as simply as I can. The bank offers multiple types of deposit products to multiple types of customers. The simplified version of this is Checking, Savings, and CD\u2019s. You can add in the retirement/pension version of these, but we\u2019ll skip over that for today. The bank pays interest to the deposit customer for (some of) these, and uses a portion of it to lend to borrowers. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s only a portion of the money that is allowed to be borrowed, and that percentage changes daily, depending on what the global deposit base looks like in each of those categories. Because CD\u2019s are \u201clocked in\u201d for a specified period of time, more of those funds are allowed to be lent out, as it is less likely that someone will come in tomorrow and close the account. Likewise, checking accounts are not only liquid, but are the most easily drained, as clients have debit cards, checks, and the ACH ability. Savings accounts are also liquid, but have some protections (limited number of withdrawals per month, etc). For this reason, not every penny you (as a consumer) deposit into the bank actually becomes borrowed funds, and if you only have checking and savings accounts, very little of it actually is. This is why your mortgage rate may be 4.75%, but you are earning \u201cnext to nothing\u201d on your savings account. If you can come in and withdraw it at any time, the bank can\u2019t count on it being there, and can\u2019t lend it all out. If you\u2019ve ever been into an aggressive bank or seen commercials on TV, the above paragraph may confuse you. How could this be true if all banks seem to want my checking account? The answer to this is two-fold. Banks want you to have a checking account because it has a lot of moving parts. They\u2019re not actually all that profitable for the bank, but once you have a checking account (that you\u2019re actually using, hence the debit card/bill pay requirements), you\u2019re more likely to stay. It\u2019s more work for you to leave if you have automatic payments, checks that could clear, etc. Once you have an established checking account, you\u2019re more likely to establish more accounts (the more profitable ones). The more accounts you have, the deeper established you are, and it becomes even less likely that you\u2019ll leave. This is why if you\u2019ve ever tried to close an account, you may have experienced some \u201cgrappling\u201d trying to hold on to you, especially if you have a decent deposit in the bank. Retail employees are incentivized to get you to open more accounts (this is not a negative thing, so don\u2019t take it as such) and in some cases to \u201csave\u201d accounts. There are two main approaches to the \u201cmost attractive\u201d client to a bank. Most banks try to utilize both, but some go after one or the other. The approach most consumers are familiar with is the \u201cblanket\u201d approach. This is where the bank attempts to get as many consumer (non-business) clients as it can. Consumers are agile and it doesn\u2019t take much work for them to leave. This makes it easier to steal them from other banks, but also more likely that they\u2019ll eventually leave. For this reason, one $1,000,000 account is often looked at as less valuable than ten $100,000 accounts. You\u2019re less likely to lose ten customers than one. At the same time, a windfall of $1,000,000 is incredibly helpful. The bank will likely offer them a higher interest rate to get them in the door, then if they threaten to leave, offer higher interest rates to get them to stay. One side-note on this topic is that checking accounts can often actually lose money for banks. They\u2019re really the \u201cgateway drug\u201d with the expectation that you\u2019ll be bringing more in. This is one reason that many banks stopped offering free checking, when they found their typical customer had a checking account (and that\u2019s it). The moving parts of a checking account actually cost the bank money, and they can\u2019t lend out a large amount of the money that is on deposit. The other approach is the \u201cbusiness-customer\u201d approach. It can be harder to get businesses in the door, but once they\u2019re in, you\u2019re less likely to lose them. There are a couple reasons for this. First, they typically have many more moving parts than individuals. They have more cash management needs (for instance, remote deposit, cash couriers, online wires, ACH origination, etc), which the bank makes some money on, but they also often have more than one decision maker, and for the larger businesses, certain protocols for doing certain things. The banks can benefit from the bureaucracy involved in some of these cases. Again, this means that once you have a business client, you\u2019re more likely to keep them. In addition to businesses being easier to keep (while higher maintenance, the bank usually offsets the higher maintenance with higher fees), businesses often keep higher balances. This means you\u2019re getting the best of both worlds. You get the $1,000,000 customer who also has a hard time leaving. As a side-note, if you look at business banking rate sheets versus consumer, you\u2019ll see that typically banks pay less interest to businesses as well. Now, you also have some costs to look at from the bank\u2019s perspective. One of the biggest costs being the salary cost. You have many departments that you have to pay, retail being one of those. Unless you\u2019re keeping retail hours open more hours than you find elsewhere in the bank, you pretty much have to align the hours somewhat closely. For instance, you need retail\u2019s support to be around when retail is. You need the various lending groups to be open when retail is (you have the same clients that will be utilizing both departments). You need the investment people around when retail is. You need management to be around when they are too. One of the departments (that appears to be going by the wayside in the industry) is the \u201cproof\u201d department. This is the department that \u201cre-processes\u201d all of the work that retail processed as a sort of double check. These people often worked much later, as they couldn\u2019t complete their work until retail was complete. With everything going digital, this is quickly changing. If you need everyone around at basically the same time, then in some regards the \u201ctalent pool\u201d does make sense. You are not as likely to find a mid-to-high level executive willing to work second shift\u2026and they are managing people that work in retail. This is only a very VERY small part of it though and can almost be discounted. The bigger piece of the puzzle circles back to what customers the bank really wants. The bank wants both business and consumer clients, but the business deposit clients provide the most money (for deposit) for the least amount of risk. That is where you will find the focus of most banks. Most businesses are open during \u201cbusiness hours,\u201d and thus that is where the bank aligns its hours. There is some truth to the fact that the banks that are only open until 5PM will lose some of the consumer clients, and it\u2019s not that the bank doesn\u2019t want these clients (the truth is that it does), but there are a couple things preventing this ability. One of those is the salary cost. The number of clients that will come in the door between 5 PM and 7 PM is relatively low, especially when looked at from a depository standpoint. The bank is likely to see transactions, sure, but the big money is generally not going into the accounts during that time period. If you are keeping employees in the branch during those two hours per day (plus extra hours on Saturdays and Sundays), you are likely either increasing the amount of staff (read: increased benefits cost) or paying overtime, just to have coverage. Keep in mind that the bank still needs employees in the bank even if there are no clients, and for insurance purposes often needs at least three (security/safety reasons\u2026we can go further into that if you want). Often, by staying open those hours, you are literally spending more money than you are making, so it simply doesn\u2019t make sense from a business perspective to stay open. People often view banks as a utility, but the fact of the matter is that it is a business and has to make a profit and actually has to pay its employees."}]}

Turk and JD spend ?5? years being poor nobodies who work exceptionally long hours, and then suddenly realizing that they have some autonomy and have to direct themselves, the transition from residents to doctors to senior staff is very well dramatized and really reflects the early career of physicians well. When the medicine is demonstrated, it is demonstrated accurately enough, but as brownribbon pointed out, it takes a backseat to the story telling, and so is not defaced in the name of drama. Most of medical practice is office work, not direct patient care, and scrubs captures that well. It is an office where you stand all day and deal with patients for a hurried few hours, and paper work and personalities all the rest. The roles of the different people are also very well done. While taken to comedic extremes, you really see the different functionaries in a hospital and how their roles create conflicts.

There's no way to predict what is important for the solution to a complex problem and what is just a red herring until after you've solved the problem. Anyway... There are actually plenty of solutions to baldness. But the problem is that they aren't viewed as acceptable (whether medically or socially). Toupees are a \"solution\" to baldness, but people think they look goofy. Women wear wigs all the time, and they can be difficult to distinguish from natural hair, and the same can be said of high-end toupees. But the toupee has become a meme representing socially inept or unacceptable schlubs. Hair transplantation is another option that quite literally eliminates the defining factor of baldness: the lack of hair in an area. People still question its ability to make \"normal-looking\" hairlines, but that is mostly informed by past techniques and not more advanced current approaches. So you're not really asking for a solution to baldness so much as an easily accessible, socially and medically acceptable solution to baldness with no or minimal side effects. And adding those caveats to \"solution\" makes it a great deal more complicated. If you're talking about *pharmaceutically* treating hair loss, that's a slightly different issue. Firstly, male pattern baldness (or \"androgenic baldness\" because it can affect women too) is genetic, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to \"treat\" genetic disorders. You can't really change the genes in a person (barring some exceedingly technical and/or experimental approaches). Your best hope is to eliminate the symptoms, which can be done with some of the approaches I've mentioned above. Secondly, baldness is related to hormonal signaling. Playing with hormones is difficult and can have some pretty severe side effects, most of which aren't acceptable when your goal is cosmetic."}]}

I'm a horse racing nut and did a paper in law school on a proposed fed take over of the sport back when steroids were a hot topic. (even though use was low and handled fairly well by states, a couple congressmen just wanted attention but that's a whole different can of worms) Anyway here goes. While its not purely arbitrary, it kinda is. Horse racing is one of the first sports dating back to biblical times when betting was permitted on games that develop skills of war, the same logic was adopted by the British and various other European governments permitting betting on these types of games. While cheating in the sport did occur, participants in the early times often came from nobility (it is the sport of kings after all) and didn't risk soiling their good name. This pared with the para-mutual type of betting (against other players not the house) had the effect of keeping corruption in the sport fairly low. As corruption did develop groups made up of owners jockeys and trainers developed to help maintain integrity in the sport. Racing and betting on it in the u.s. was established before we were even a nation by various colonial governors aptd. by the British who viewed racing as a great source of entertainment. Since this time while the sport by no means has an absolutely clean record of purity, states interest in the sport who helped establish it and run it, paired with groups such as the jockeys club did a good enough job policing the sport internally. So when other sports without long traditions of gaming went though scandals, congress under the guise of morality banned betting across state lines to \"protect\" citizens and maintain those sports integrity as they believed that they could not police their own. The tradition of gaming on racing, current state involvement, and proven ability to police itself, however allowed passage of the interstate horse racing act permitting states to determine their own rules when it came to horse racing. While personally I believe that states could have made the same determination for all sports congress reacting to things such as the black socks believed that other sports were too corrupt to even permit states to allow their citizens to gamble on them."}]}
{"id": "5a0gdf", "input": "How are genders different than sexes and what do many different genders mean?", "output": [{"answer": "Since there is a lot of overlapping terminology I'm going to use \"male\" and \"female\" when I'm refering to sex and \"man\" and \"woman\" when refering to gender. The definitions I'm going to give for the different genders aren't set in stone and are debatable. But, it's a good entry point. Sex is a biological trait that is related to our genes and hormones. In our DNA we have what are called sex chromosomes \"x\" and \"y\". Generally XX chromosomes create a female sexed person and XY create a male sexed person. There are other combinations, sometimes with more than two. In addition, because of other genetic effects hormones can override these chromosomes and create other sex traits. Arguably male and female are the most common, but intersex people of varying sorts aren't particularly uncommon. Gender is how we as a society expect the sexes to behave in that society but also to some extent how a person wants to interact with society with regards to their sex. So, if we looked at the US in the 50's that might mean, women have long hair. Men had short hair. Men went to work. Women stayed at home with the kids. Men liked cars. Women liked cooking. Etc. etc. etc. The usage of new gender words is to try to express the feeling many people have that their gender is either more complicated or innaccurate than the default society wants to give. The different new genders express similar but somewhat distinct ideas. People who are genderfluid tend to find that they will sometimes strongly identify with certain gender roles at different times. So a person who might love to wear very masculine suits and very feminine dresses may be genderqueer. Genderqueer is someone who finds that the normal expression of gender doesn't quite capture how they feel. They don't quite see themselves as men or as women but something amalgamated. Gender neutral is someone who sees themselves as having less gendered content. Often times gender neutral, genderqueer and genderfluid are thrown around as interchangeable. They aren't exactly. But for many people they effectively are so similar and used in such a variety of ways they all end up roughly meaning \"not quite men not quite women\". All of this is made more complicated by the fact that liberal socities are generally trying to break down gender roles as it is. While there has been great progress compared with say, the middle ages, there is still a TON of assumed gendered behavior that just doesn't capture people's lived experiences. I'm a little hungover so let me know if I need to do any clarifying! EDIT: Just to re-iterate a point. Sex is also more complicated than a lot of people are saying. There are more sexes than simply male or female so it's not just you are born male or female. Follows is a link with some info on intersex (which are those people who are born not exactly male or not exactly female).  URL_0  EDIT 2: HOLY SHIT! Reddit gold! Thank you anonymous benefactor! This is my first ever reddit gold. I also passed the New York bar this week. It's been a good week (the reddit gold is better). I want to quickly address a few of the \"biological\" points that came up in this thread and why they don't really answer the question. Someone pointed out that standard female brains tend to be smaller (which for those MRA people out there has absolutely zero correlation with intelligence), men usually have more testosterone etc etc. This is true. But notice how I had to use words like \"standard\" and \"tend\" to. It is not always the case that if you take 1 woman and 1 man they will always have relative differences based on those factors. Some women have bigger brains and more testosterone than some men. This then fails the necessary 1 to 1 requirement of a definition. For example, if I said a chair has 4 legs and then showed you one with 5 legs or three legs (or none, like a rocking chair on skis), you would have to say well it's not a chair or my definition is wrong. In this instance, I think using those points may help us understand trends and tendencies (but probably not) they don't help define gender or sex. Again I want to point out that sex is something on the biological level and unless you have a habit of DNA testing all of the people you know, you won't ever meaningfully interact with a person's sex. Because you can only ever interact with a person who has been socialized you will always interact with their gender expression. These words help more than 1% of the population. And even if they only help 1% of the population, in the USA alone that is 3 million people. That is a lot of people. I admit, learning a few new words is an inconvenience and takes some processing power (you have to read my whole post). Once you've read the post. You now know the words and can't make the argument that you will be harmed by using the words. You already know them. Seriously though, the inconvenience is minuscule on a societal level to grasp new words. I also want to point out that the idea of non-binary gender is not new. Many cultures have had third and fluid genders. For example, North American Native Americans (exactly how many tribes is currently under debate) who had a concept of two spirits and had 4 different gender categories. This idea of third gender and gender non conforming is even in the kama sutra. Plato's Symposium mentions a creation myth with Male, Female and Gender Neutral characters. EDIT 3: One more clarification. The reason individual gender expression and letting an individual pick their own gender is the best solution is precisely because gender on a social level is a weak concept. As many people have accurately pointed out women can wear pents, men can have long hair etc. etc. Agreed! That's why things often associated with gender aren't defining, merely associated (in fact many of the things often thought defining of gender in our times were different in other times, Pink used to be a boys color (it was like blood and men were bloody), and in the Middle Ages in Europe women were seen as the sexual predators and men were the innocents who needed to protect themselves). Since pretty much anything associated with gender isn't a 1 to 1 it doesn't define any gender. Therefore, there is no good way to make a call as to who is or isn't a particular gender on a macro level. Therefore, the only way to accurately sort people is to just let people sort themselves."}]}
{"id": "6fcl9v", "input": "Why does magnetism seem so similar to gravity? Is there a relationship between the two forces?", "output": [{"answer": "Magnetism and gravity are forces. Other forces include the (\"static\") electric force, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. Physicists have been trying to \"unify\" these forces, i.e. take many existing descriptions and figure out a single description which explains all of them. So far, we've unified the electric and magnetic forces into a single \"electromagnetic\" force. We've also unified the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces into the \"electroweak\" force (this was mostly theoretical until the Higgs boson was discovered at CERN). One way to think of a force is for some objects to have a \"charge\", and for charged objects to push/pull on each other. For gravity, there only seems to be one charge, which we call \"mass\". Magnetism seems to have two, which we call \"north\" and \"south\". Electromagnetism makes this clearer: there are two charges, called \"positive\" and \"negative\", which cause electric push/pull effects for objects which aren't moving (\"static\"; relative to each other) and magnetic push/pull effects for those which are. The strong nuclear force has three charges, which we call \"colours\" (\"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\"). Out of the known forces, both gravity and electromagnetism are \"long range\": they can act over arbitrarily large distances: think of the Earth and Sun pulling on each other, and the Sun's light (a form of \"electromagnetic wave\") reaching the Earth. The strength of these forces gets spread uniformly through 3D space, so they follow an \"inverse square law\". The nuclear forces are \"short range\": their effects are strong when charged objects are very close, like inside the nucleus of an atom, but get much weaker over longer distances; much weaker than an inverse square law. One explanation is that the objects push and pull each other by sending out particles. The particles for the nuclear forces (\"gluons\", \"W bosons\" and \"Z bosons\") have mass, which makes them unstable and radioactive. As the distance between charged objects increases, not only do these particles get spread out through a larger volume, but they also decay radioactively. This accounts for their weakness at large distances. The particles for gravity and electromagnetism (called \"gravitons\" and \"photons\") don't have mass, so they're stable and not radioactive. Hence they can keep spreading out forever without decaying, resulting in long range effects and an inverse square law. Note that gravitons are still theoretical and have never been detected. We have detected photons, W bosons and Z bosons.

The collapse of the Mughal era saw the rise of powerful men who associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, affirming the regal and martial form of the caste ideal, and it also reshaped many apparently casteless social groups into differentiated caste communities. The British Raj furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration. Between 1860 and 1920, the British segregated Indians by caste, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes."}]}

{"id": "3m594p", "input": "Say I'm 70 years old, only got a few years left, what's stopping me from spending a lot of money and racking up a load of debt?", "output": [{"answer": "The correct answer is nothing, but its generally risky and the reward is limited. Its basically the same reason that 70 years old don't do heroin. They just keep doing what they've been doing. They mostly try to enjoy time with their loved ones, have sex with other elderly people, stay healthy, and hope to live for another 20 years. First, it is generally possible to do what you're asking because many 70 year-olds have terrific credit with no assets or significant income. Credit has very little to do with assets, liabilities and income. It has a lot to do with a documented history of willingness and ability to pay back debts as agreed, on time. Although a personal financial statement is a valuable tool for a bank to assess risk when making a 6+ figure construction or real estate loan, it is not an effective predictor of whether an individual will reliably pay back a 4-5 figure unsecured debt. A documented history of paying back such debts -- e.g. a credit score -- is a valuable predictor. This leads to counter-intuitive situations, such as where a 90+ year old man has a credit score that qualifies him or her for a great mortgage rate, but the bank refuses to offer similar terms to his (also elderly) children who are still employed, even with the father as a guarantor. An elderly person with a good credit score, but limited financial acumen is exactly the person who is taken in in their old age by Spanish lottery scams. This is why those scams exist: because what you're asking about actually happens. Older people with good credit, no assets, and no income get sucked in. That said, even though nothing would be stopping you, your hypothetical is rarely so uncomplicated. Most people do not know how exactly how long they have left. Maybe you have never seen a completely destitute old person in your life. Their lives are hard. If you are not sure that you will die around the time the money runs out, you may be better off not going bonkers. Also, the 50-100k you can borrow doesn't go as far as you would think. How do you envision spending the money? Giving it to your loved ones is fraud and they can get into legal trouble or have to give it back. Cocaine and strippers are okay, but then what? Is it worth your dignity or your pride to be a fool when you're that close to bowing out gracefully? Finally, most 70 year olds have figured out that blowing cash isn't all its cracked up to be. Most 40 year olds know this too. Mostly you end up wishing you still had the security. Mostly you think, I could have just used my personality and a couple bucks to wander the earth for awhile, doing some good deeds and having some laughs. But you're 5 and you'll have to learn all that the hard way."}]}

Even very dry wood, is still considerably wet and full of water by weight. Water doesn't burn, it creates steam. There is also hydrocarbons that when heated make up something we call wood gas, which is usually the first thing that burns when you light wood on fire, along with the sap. Wood burns incompletely and inefficiently so it burns much slower. After all of the volatiles are used up, the real kcal value of wood comes from the carbon, which when combined with heat and oxygen gets you carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and even more heat. When you make charcoal you are not just burning wood, you are heating it in the absence of oxygen so that it can't really burn. It drives out all of the moisture, sap, tar, and volatiles which contribute only a small amount of energy when burned, and what you are left with is mostly elemental carbon. Carbon is not ash though, it's fuel. The higher carbon content of charcoal allows it to burn really hot, and it takes a flame really well. It has a higher kcal value by weight than wood does so it packs a lot of energy per kilo of fuel. It also burns very cleanly since the only real by products are ash, heat, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and whatever trace elements were left behind."}]}
{"id": "2n4xg4", "input": "How did adding \"Le-\" or \"De-\" to the beginning of a more traditional name become prominent in Black American culture?", "output": [{"answer": "Black Americans have been in something like a permanent state of identity-crisis, that will probably not abate until either: - Terms like \"African-American\" are accepted as fully and as un-ironically as \"Polish-American\" or \"Irish-American\", or; - Race itself becomes such a nebulous, blended, and indistinct thing that skin-color is regarded as no different from eye or hair color. In the meantime, a particular challenge for black Americans is disconnection from historic familial roots. An Irish-American family might name their kid Sean or Daniel or Molly or Colleen or Mary, with some connection to those who came before (even if those names might bear little or no resemblance to ancient Irish names and culture). Most black Americans bear family names from the slave-owners of their forbears, or arbitrary names given to freedmen. A white American man named, say, Robert DiGiacomo might go by \"Bobby\", and might consider himself mostly German/Scots, but he knows where his name comes from, and he knows that his father was descended from an Italian. If he wanted to, Bobby G could probably trace his ancestry back to specific people and families from any number of countries. A black man named Robert Smith might have little more than a vague idea that one of his ancestors was once owned by a man named \"Smith\". It is unlikely that he could reliably trace most of his family tree back further than slavery, since good records were not kept, about the lineage and ancestry of slaves. And any \"deep past\" records of his roots might actually refer to white parentage that abandoned or rejected their multi-racial offspring. He might not be able to able to find the specific African language, name-tradition, or region his ancestors came from, even if he tried. As a result, many Black Americans have chosen to embrace an entirely new notion of heritage and identity, based on the global infusion of African culture into a worldwide diaspora. This could include elements of Caribbean, Creole, French-colonial, and Anglo-American influences, as well as pan-African culture (and Africa is a very big place, with wildly-divergent cultures, easily as different as Irish is from Greek, or Japanese is from Indian). One example of this embrace of Black pan-culturalism is choosing or creating names that might sound exotic in any language. People who know the names of their ancestors might choose names that come from the same tradition. But when you don't know the names of your ancestors, or when you know their legal names to be \"fake\" names given to them by the people who bought and sold them like chattel, it's not so easy. If you know something vague of where you came from, and that you are part of a diaspora that has influences the world over, you might choose to give your child a name that reflects that uncertain melding of cultures. Indian parents might name their kids \"Vijay\", Swedish-Americans might name their kids \"Gustav\", Japanese might name their kids \"Haruto\", Italian-Americans might go with \"Antonio\", etc... But Black Americans descended from the nebulous heritage of slavery have no obvious tradition of forefathers to turn to, when it comes to naming their children, except maybe slave-names. So many choose to invent or adopt new names, as the ancients did in other cultures. Just as names like \"Antonio\" or \"Robert\" or \"Seamus\" were once invented and applied to children, so names like Leshawn or Taniqua are invented or adopted by people who are not without a culture, not without a heritage, just without a fixed vocabulary, due to its newness. The African diaspora has had a massive global influence on culture, but it happened in very different ways than other historically-recent diasporas. We were not around 1,000 or 10,000 years ago, when the Europeans or Africans were first inventing names. In the great re-combinator that is global cultural evolution, Black America has emerged as a new distinct cultural tradition, much as Celts and Gauls diverged and became things like Scotch, Irish and German, hundreds of years ago. The culture of \"Black America\", and of the African diaspora more generally, is still in its infancy. We're still in an era where people who lived under Jim Crow are alive and kicking, and the last slaves are only a few decades dead. As people with names like Kanye, Obama, and Deshawn become more prominent and influential participants in the global economy of ideas, their names will begin to sound less strange. We are seeing the emergence of a new global cultural tradition, with ethnic and historical influences that are distinct from the existing ones. Black American culture has a very troubled and difficult past, and much of it still has a troubled and difficult present, but its present is no worse than that of, say, the Irish from 150 years ago. (\"How the Irish Became White\" is an interesting read on the topic of historical race-identity). Black America, and the African Diaspora more generally, is still in the process of inventing itself, as a cultural identity. And that includes names. It has contributed a tremendous amount of good to the world in its early days, and there is no reason to think it won't get better. edit: wow, RIP inbox, and thanks for all the gold! **To address some of the FAQs:** - \"Obama isn't a made-up name! And it's a last name!\": Yes, I meant that as more people adopt it as a first name, and as more names that sound \"black\" come into prominence and familiarity, they will start to sounds less exotic or strange. Sorry for the ambiguity. - \"I don't think anyone really calls themselves 'Irish American' or 'Polish American'. Everyone is just American.\" There are thousands of Irish-American, Polish-American, Italian-American, German-American clubs, all across the US. So it is definitely a thing for some people, although maybe not for you. - \"I disagree with the term 'African Americans', because it's not an accurate term, or something about hyphens.\" You're right, it's not an accurate term. Neither is \"black\" or \"white\" (that's more like a dark-brown to pinkish spectrum). I try to use words with commonly-accepted meanings, as they are commonly understood. Unfortunately, sometimes we use short words to refer to complex or nuanced ideas such as race and ethnic identity, and it can be hard to discuss anything other than the verbiage and nomenclature itself, without adopting some kind of shorthand that someone is bound to find objectionable. - \" 'Scotch' should be used for whisky and tape, not to describe people.\" Sorry, I stand corrected. Error left as posted, for continuity-purposes. A lot of other posters have raised a lot of very good and interesting points, and others have raised a lot of bad and long-discredited ones.

Dementia is like forgetting your keys; Alzheimers is like staring at your keys and forgetting what they are for. People with Alzheimers don't just forget stuff, their brain does not know how to do stuff that they didn't even think about before (like read simple words, sign your name, feed yourself or control bladders and bowels). Scientists can't even be sure how much people with advanced Alzheimers understand about their surroundings. My grandmother basically died of alzheimers (her body essentially \"forgot\" how to function) and her language ability degraded in a very gradual way that we didn't even notice at first, but before she was completely unable to speak had her reduced to a few short phrases that made sense in the context of the conversation, but she couldn't say anything else. She did understand speech- she knew what was happening to her but didn't need \"reminding\" of anything other than to do things like take her dentures out, chew her sandwich etc. When she could still speak, she was obviously aware of who people were in our family, but she called us all by the wrong names, not because she had forgotten- it was more like the connection in her brain was telling her \"I know who this is, it's blah\". She called my mum and my aunt her sisters' names, and me and my sister my mum and my aunt's names but she knew that we were not her sisters and her daughters, but her daughters and her grandchildren, so we just got used to what our \"Granny\" name was and she knew who she meant. Terry Pratchett said in an interview a while ago that he was staring at his keyboard and couldn't work out where the A (or something) was (sorry I don't have a source), so that's the kind of thing Alzheimers causes.

They are always kept in a totally empty tank.", "output": [{"answer": "They are very delicate and extremely hard to keep in tanks for that reason. They are mostly water with very thin membranes as their body structure. Any sharp object can rip them apart fairly easily. Of course, there are lots of larger jellies that have evolved to be more durable, or can grow big enough to withstand damage (like the Stygiomedusa gigantea, or the larger fried egg jellyfish specimens). But the vast majority are small and mostly helpless, except for their unique stinging cells, but that doesn't affect their ability to survive in a tank. In their natural environment, they usually just float freely with the currents in the open ocean, so there's nothing for them to bump up against (except predators). They aren't strong swimmers either, so they can get stranded or trapped easily if the current washes them onto the shore or pushes them into a confined area. In order to most closely replicate their natural environment, jellies need tanks with rounded edges to keep from getting stuck in corners, a gentle current to propel them around the tank, and a small amount of food suspended in the water. They have very specific requirements for temperature and water pH, but I don't know those details, you could probably find them on an aquarist website, though. No gravel since they could scrape against the grains and tear up their membranes. No plants since they could get stuck in the leaves. I don't think the jellyfish stings would be good for the plant either, but maybe it would be fine. Anyway, there ya go!

It's often called a \"parliamentary procedure,\" as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature.

Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill, unless they had a 60-vote majority (a \"Fillibuster-proof majority.\" Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time. Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster, and today, the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ([Senators in the past were known to read recipes, Shakespeare, anything in sight]( URL_0 )) Now, to your questions: Why is it valid? Because it works for the minority party. Why is it not simply dismissed? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future. You'll hear of the \"Nuclear Option\" from time to time, a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules (by simple majority). So far, it has not happened. I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented (the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old) and scorched-earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway.

{"id": "65aa7o", "input": "Why is hand flapping a behavior common to many people with autism?", "output": [{"answer": "I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario. Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc. Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... It's incredibly pleasant to process. Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed. I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed."}]}

{"id": "1z8fex", "input": "Why is a 2 liter of Coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?", "output": [{"answer": "First, I somewhat have to take issue with your pricing. Where I live, the supermarkets generally sell 2-liter bottles for $1.89 and vending machines and merchants sell a 20-oz for $1.25-$1.75. Now, there's always some soda on sale for $1 for a 2-liter. That seems like the price you're thinking about, but it isn't always Coke or the soda you'd most prefer. This serves two purposes. 1) There are some people who might only buy soda at $1 for 2-liters. They don't want to lose those sales, but would like to charge people willing to pay a higher price more. There will be some people who are brand loyal and only get the $1 price a third of the time. That way, the average selling price to people who are brand loyal and willing to pay $1.89 becomes $1.59 while the store doesn't lose out on the cheapskates. 2) Supermarkets need to entice you to purchase things. Most people don't go to the supermarket thinking, \"I need this item for the next 15 minutes\". So, they want to entice you to purchase it. If you go to a lunch cafe or a vending machine, you're buying something that you want at that moment. They don't need to entice you - you're thirsty and want to quench that thirst now, not on wednesday when you go shopping. Second, usually when you buy a 2-liter of Coke, you're buying something that isn't refrigerated. When you buy a 20-oz bottle, you're usually getting a refrigerated soda. Refrigeration costs money (electricity to run the units and the units themselves). Third, usually you purchase smaller bottles from more convenient locations. You can't compare the supermarket price of a 2-liter bottle to the price you get for a soda in a more convenient location. From the prices you quote, it sounds like you're comparing the price offered by a supermarket on sale for a 2-liter to the standard price offered by your local pizza place for a 20-oz. **tl;dr:** With a 2-liter, you're pre-planning a purchase of an non-refrigerated beverage for later from a discount store; with a 20-oz bottle, usually you're grabbing a refrigerated one for immediate consumption from a convenient non-discount location. In terms of water, many types of water are shipped. Soda is an efficient beverage to transport. They ship syrup to local bottling plants. If a gallon of syrup makes 5 gallons of soda, they would need 5x the number of trucks hauling liquid for spring water. I think a gallon of syrup making 5 gallons is probably a conservative estimate, but you can see how transportation takes its toll on the price of spring water in a way that it doesn't with soda. For bottled tap water, there still may be a transportation issue if they don't have as many bottling centers. Maybe it's the same water they put into Coke, maybe it isn't. Even if it is, people get a certain price in their head for a type of product and spring and other bottled water seem like substitutes."}]}

For anything you build it\u2019s incredibly important to know elevations of everywhere you intend to be building. For roads specifically you\u2019re looking at vertical curve along the road (how it\u2019s elevation changes) as well as from the center to the sides so rain runs off. You also need to know elevation so you can properly predict how far down you need to dig to put your base and sub base (basically different grades of rocks that keep buildings/roads steady so they don\u2019t sink). We use theodolites to do what\u2019s called horizontal survey. We use these to do layout and stakeout of the bounds where everything will be. Imagine putting four stakes in the ground for where the corners of the building will be, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d use them for. They\u2019re REALLY precise for turning angles.

That stress forces you to seek out something that will comfort you. Maybe you will have a snack, you're getting a bit hungry, you'll do a better job if you don't try to write the paper hungry. Oh shit, another 20 minutes have passed. etc. Eventually, the stress builds up to the point that it motivates you to act because you aren't worried about whether you're going to have a good enough paper, you're worried about whether you will have any paper at all, and by that point your only escape is to either write the paper, or not. It's hard to break that cycle, and the only real way to do that is learn to mute that anticipation of discomfort. But that is rooted pretty deep in our psyche, and is really kind of the same sort of thing that keeps us from touching a hot stove. Some people get over it by psyching themselves up, and with positive self-talk. Personally, I think what's best is to cool down, meditate or otherwise clear my head, decide rationally what I'm going to do, and try to do the absolute least amount possible adequately. If it's a paper, I don't think about whether it's going to be good or not, I don't think about failure or success. I just open Word. I look at the assignment. I could just stop there if I want, that's easy. No reason to procrastinate on that. Then I take one more step, I choose my topic. It doesn't have to be the best topic, it just has to be a topic. Maybe I choose a few. They don't have to be the best. Then I think about which of those is the easiest for me to turn into something interesting. Again, nothing here is high pressure, nothing here is hard, I can't succeed or fail at any of this, I've just done some easy things. I am not doing it as the first steps to complete the paper, I'm not doing it with the goal to write an A level paper. I'm just thinking about the question, for myself. Of these topics, which point would be easiest to describe? Then maybe I would jot down some structure. Here's a topic to discuss, here's a topic to discuss, here's a topic to discuss. I'd think about why they're interesting. I wouldn't think about why my teacher would think they're interesting, but I've picked what I thought was the most interesting topic. Maybe I have an opinion or idea on this point of discussion, maybe I'll look it up to see if my opinion is shared or if my idea is supported. Oh cool, I was right. Oh cool, I was mistaken. I take a few notes about this. After a while, I'm genuinely interested in the topic, even if it wasn't something I was totally interested in to start with, I've given myself enough lead in to the paper to actually care about whether my preconceptions match reality, or some of the more interesting points in the discussion. By that point, I'm writing the paper for my own benefit. I'll format it in the structure that my teacher expects, but only because it's easy enough to do and get that out of the way while I'm working on figuring out some things about a topic that is now reasonably interesting. But as soon as I'm thinking about doing it for the purpose of not getting punished for a bad grade or a bad result, I'm far more likely to start to procrastinate."}]}

But usually the duals at the back have a \"spider\" type of coupling which essentially bolts the outer wheel to the hub. If you made that connection any longer than it has to be, then all the considerable weight that is transferred to that wheel, has more leverage on the axle. The front wheels are singles to, different setup with brakes etc, but they also only take a small amount of load. At best the bobtail (truck with no trailer) is likely only 8t and spread between the front and back wheels. When loaded, you don't really increase that load, but you may expect a lot more on each axle at the back. Add to that the torque you create by turning. The inner wheels move a different distance than the outers, but they are in lockstep, causing a \"screwing\" kinda phenomenon. I don't know if this has anything to do with the hub design, but it is nevertheless a force acting on the wheels."}]}

Importantly, they're bound to hold off on questioning you further until you've been afforded this oppurtunity, barring exceptional exigent circumstances and investigative necessity. If you're detained at a police station, this usually means the Police will place you in a designated private phone room with a phone book (sometimes ipads/tablets these days depending on the station). In Canada, Police are also obligated to provide you with phone numbers for duty counsel, who are free on-call lawyers who provide limited immediate advice relevant to the circumstances of your arrest. Depending on what province you're in, this may be a \"1-800\" 24/7 hotline number or a list of lawyers which ought to be provided to you by police. Depending on the time of your arrest, you may be on hold for anywhere from 10 to 20 or more minutes trying to get through to duty counsel, due to wait time on a 1 800 number or non-response from listed roster numbers. If you do not wish to waive your right, its important you are diligent and patient and stay on the line/keep calling numbers. Cutting myself off before this verges into legal advice territory, if you do not understand your right to counsel, or wish to speak to a lawyer but are having difficulty getting in contact with one despite your best efforts, its important to communicate that to police in unequivocal terms. The police are not expected to read your mind, but where its clearly known to them that someone doesn't understand their rights or is having difficulty excercising those rights, they are generally bound to make further reasonable efforts to discharge their informational and implementational duties under 10(b) of the Charter.

yeah. you're definitely gonna take some time off your life by using, but that's a risk/reward thing that the individual must consider on their own. personally, it's worth the risk for me. to have a chance to be the best at what i do, i would need to juice no matter what. and i'm following my dreams even if it takes time off of my life. edit: if anyone wants me to go into more detail about anything in particular that i said, i'd be glad to do so, just ask. these explanations are pretty simplified believe it or not. if you're confused about something, i'd love to explain the process behind what i'm talking about and show you what i mean."}]}

When you suddenly stop drinking, it takes your body a while to realize it needs to make those chemicals again. The lag time between stopping alcohol and chemical production can be a decent amount of time. That's \"withdrawal\", basically. With alcohol and benzos, that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you. Edit; as others have corrected me, I figured I'd add this for clarity. My post is mostly right, but backwards. The brain doesn't stop making chemicals. It makes way too much, and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much. So when you stop drinking, the brain is still making a ton of stuff, but it's all working now instead of being blocked by the alcohol. Sorry for the mix up. My source is a class I took in college a few years ago, and I remembered the gist of it without the details. Thanks again for the corrections! Also, as a word of warning, this shit is serious. When you read that you can die from alcohol or benzo withdrawal, that means YOU CAN DIE. If you or someone you know is trying to get clean off these, they really should check into a clinic or hospital to be safe. Or at least have someone with some knowledge really closely monitor symptoms, and be willing to call for an ambulance if need be. Edit2. Benzos, not barbs. Fixed that in my original post.

I mean, it may not function but on long term capitalism won't either.", "output": [{"answer": "For some 150 years, there has been an ongoing smear campaign in America against socialism and communism (which most people just take as the same thing), and now many Americans just automatically associate it with evil. Back in the 19th century, socialism became quite popular among people fighting for social justice and decent working conditions and pay. Socialism almost caught on as a major political force, there were several socialist political candidates that did well. But the robber barons of the time mounted an enormous smear campaign against it, equating it with anarchy, bomb-throwing lunatics, etc. When Stalin shot whoever was standing in front of him and seized control of Russia, that made things a whole lot easier for the smear campaign, because now it was easy to confuse people by conflating Stalinism with socialism (made easier by Russia loudly proclaiming it was socialist. It really wasn't very). Also in the early 20th century, the government finally got off its ass and started passing health and safety laws, and unions gained significant power in dealing with workplace atrocities, so socialism began to fall out of favor among the general public. By the time of the Cold War, the decades of propaganda finally paid off, and socialism acquired the permanent taint of dictatorship and evil some still associate with it today. Indeed, the conservatives managed to shoot down the nascent universal healthcare movement by branding it as \"socialized medicine.\" A B-movie actor named Ronald Reagan even recorded a speech detailing the HORRORS of socialized medicine, and it was released on a record album that got played at a lot of country club luncheons. Decades later, long after the collapse of the Soviet system, when the ACA was being debated, conservatives even trotted out the old term like it was some dusty, moldy, old cardboard Frankenstein statue at a carny funhouse. And people still swallowed it. However, today we know that the \"international communist threat\" was never really MUCH of a threat. They sought to increase their \"market share\" in the world, sure. Just like every other superpower in history. But it turns out they really had no plans to roll tanks across Europe and take over the world. Khrushchev himself wrote that Stalin was terrified by the thought of all-out war with the west. The Russians took a horrific beating from JUST the Germans in WWII, and were not anxious for a second round with the entire west. The cold war arms race was really mainly started by the US. In the 1950s, the CIA issued a seriously-flawed report that said the Rooskies had WAY more nuclear-capable bombers than they really did. So the US panicked and started building bombers like there was no tomorrow. The CIA followed that up in the early 60s with a report that said the Soviets had some 490 nukes pointed at us, and the US soiled its underwear. So it started building nuclear missiles like there was no tomorrow. And there almost WASN'T. When the Russians saw the US cranking out nukes like cheap hot dogs, the only reasonable conclusion they could come to was that it was because we intended to attack them and wipe them off the planet. So THEY started building nukes like mad. \"Wait,\" I hear you cry. \"STARTED building nukes? What about the 490 they already had?\" Well, see, funny story there. The CIA report was just a weensy bit off in its estimation of Russian nuclear strength. And by \"a weensy bit,\" I mean TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. At the time, Russia had four--count 'em--FOUR nukes capable of hitting the US. tl;dr: Americans were trained to consider socialism as evil by the rich, and then it became government policy.

Gutters are useful here because rain falling off an eave washes away the soil near the house since Florida soil is sandy. Houses in Florida don't have basements, therefore they have no underground support other than the slab and footers. Any water that repeatedly falls that close to the house is likely to cause small subsidences underneath the footers and crack the foundation. Sandy soil sucks. People saying that heavy rains are too much for gutters have either never done gutter work, were too cheap to pay a reputable company to do the work and instead got a shitty product from a hardware store, or don't live in a place where local gutter companies have the need to provide more than 3-inch gutters. If you have a gutter company, and know what you're doing (i.e. not using the bullshit gutters from the hardware store), you have the ability to do custom jobs and make gutters up to 5 inches wide and infinitely long. If five inches isnt enough, special orders can be made to get wider ones so either way rain amount doesn't make gutters useless unless you have clogged up, too small, or shitty quality gutters. The reason most building companies don't do it themselves comes down to cost. Gutters cant be installed until the rest of the house is finished and inspected, and builders don't want to pay for the additional vehicles and all the specialized equipment they would need when it would ultimately cause them to wait extra months for the house to be completed and collect their money from the contract. Not to mention that it would also mean hiring additional workers that specialize in gutters and don't have any other function. They're not going to have special trucks for gutter equipment that sit around unused for months at a time while the framers, concrete guys, or roofers (that would be required to double as gutter guys) wait on the electricians, drywallers, flooring guys, painters, and etc. to finish the rest of the house. It's easy enough for the builder to contract gutter work out to an established company if the homeowner wants them on the house as part of the build. TL;DR: Cost. It wouldn't be beneficial for a building company to buy all the needed equipment and hire more employees since it would take a long time and a lot of gutters to start making a profit.

{"id": "2pomwo", "input": "Why are so many Americans staunchly against a form of national health service when all the evidence states that they're the most effective way of administering healthcare to the populace?", "output": [{"answer": "I think the big thing is that, for the most part many Americans already have insurance, can go see good caring doctors, when they do get sick can get advanced care all under their insurance, and it is mostly on their terms.

As for the quality of care, for the vast majority of Americans who ARE insured it is still world class. On the chart you will notice that the US was much higher when it came to rankings of the actual conduct of the care, it was the access to it which drove it down, and frankly I think at the end of the day most Americans would agree more can be done to help those who are unable to access it, they are also very conscious of how much they have taken out of their pay every month."}]}

Hence, any new infrastructure schemes need to be shoe-horned on top of existing settlements which will be highly disruptive. (2) Cultural bias - People are very ashamed about pooping and menstruation, so much so, that a lot of people prefer out-houses or very distant pooping zones in the forests, as opposed to having a pooping-room inside the house, which is considered dirty or shameful. Some people don't even accept pooping in the same place someone else pooped before, because this is also considered \"ew\". So, the concept of a \"re-usable pooping place inside the house\" is entirely repulsive. (3) Priorities - While urban middle-class and upper-classes have good toilets, lower-classes prefer spending money on cell-phones and scooters over toilets, simply because that tech is more vital to their jobs/businesses/survival.

{"id": "5meqrp", "input": "Why do top nutrition advisory panels continue to change their guidelines (sometimes dramatically) on what constitutes a healthy diet?", "output": [{"answer": "One additional issue is that nutrition is difficult to study in a controlled fashion. First, unlike testing a drug, where you can give the control group a placebo and the experimental group the active drug, you cannot give a control group no/placebo food. You have to replace the food you are trying to get experimental data on with some other food. Want to test the effects of eating saturated fats? You have to create a control diet that replaces those calories with something else (or you run into another experimental problem where a lower-calorie diet may be producing the results you see), and it's impossible to know the full extent of what replacing those calories does. Do you replace them with unsaturated fats? Carbohydrates? Diets also tend to be very heterogeneous. This can be a problem when people like to compare population-level data (epidemiological study rather than a controlled study). People looked at the \"Mediterranean diet\" and saw people eating more monounsaturated (and some polyunsaturated) fats, but they tended to ignore MANY confounding factors, even things that probably have a significant impact like eating more whole foods rather than processed foods and even differences in total calories. Scientists don't tend to set up highly controlled studies where people all eat the same foods, but rather eat whatever they want (or what they are supposed to eat/avoid) and then report back occasionally, with varying degrees of accuracy. Early research on fats didn't treat trans-fats as a separate category and lumped them in with saturated fats, which may have helped create stigma against saturated fats (although there were a lot of political headaches that go into this history). Finally, different organisms handle different foods and macronutrients differently! Yet people (especially media reporting a new study) will often take results from a mouse study as if it applies equally to humans or other animals. TL;DR nutrition is complex, heterogeneous, and difficult to control in large experiments, forcing us to rely on less rigorous methods."}]}

Now let's say you appeal because the driver of the other car had a higher alcohol blood concentration in their blood than you did, you might get off on all 4 counts; the passengers of the other car got into a car with a driver drunker than you were, whatever, I am just speaking hypothetically to paint an illustration of times you would want to keep sentences separate, for appeals. **Parole** A life sentence can be \"without the possibility of parole\" or \"with the possibility of parole\" and if you can get parole, then you may be eligible for parole in, say 25 years. If you have 3 consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole, you serve 75 years before you go in front of a parole board. The reason the sentences can be so confusing is that each crime carries a maximum penalty, by law, and the judge **cannot** give you a longer sentence. The just does not have to give you the maximum sentence, but almost always will, because if you are being sentenced, then you pleaded not guilty, and you made the prosecutor work hard for the conviction. If you had just pleaded guilty, you could have entered a plea bargain for less time, and the prosecutor would not have had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt you did it, and would not have needed to select a jury. You plea bargain for less time, the judge gives you the sentence you agreed to with the prosecutor. If pleading guilty carried the maximum sentence, very few people would ever plea guilty, because they have nothing to lose by pleading innocent, so this gives the defendant an incentive to bargain with the prosecutor. Even if you bargain for the max sentence, it may be the max to a *lesser crime*, so if you planned a murder and you are eligible for the death sentence, you may bargain down to manslaughter and get the max sentence. Mind you, the max sentence for manslaughter is already specified in the law; possibly, and IMHO, to prevent cruel and unusual punishment, but IANAL. So the sentences for crimes are mandated by law, and you can bargain for a shorter sentence for the same crime, or the full sentence for a crime that carries a shorter max sentence. Also, you can appeal to a higher court and get one charge overturned, but not all charges. The judge cannot sentence a jay-walker to the death sentence, because the max penalty for jay walking is explained in the penal code that prohibits jay walking, and some crimes do not allow \"life without parole\" but they allow \"life with parole\" for each crime, and the same crime was committed on multiple counts"}]}
{"id": "6efne8", "input": "How after 5000 years of humanity surviving off of bread do we have so many people within the last decade who are entirely allergic to gluten?", "output": [{"answer": "We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread. Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer. On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know. Tldr: shits complicated literally edit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes. People seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). Until relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning. There is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone. example: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going? We do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a \"fix\" but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). tldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal \"live a healthy lifestyle\" advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don't ask for a quick fix and don't trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten.  URL_3   URL_4   URL_5   URL_1   URL_6   URL_2   URL_0  edit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average \"but gluten\" person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence:  URL_7 "}]}
{"id": "3ql3y9", "input": "Why is the US Constitution regarded so highly?", "output": [{"answer": "Short answer. The Constitution *is* our country. More accurate answer: The Constitution is the instruction manual of the country. Everything that we conceptualize as the United States Government is what is written in the constitution and it's amendments. Even if it were a shit document (and it really isn't) as a constitutional republic and a nation state, it would still be a component of our national identity. For many the ambiguity of the Constitution is a good thing. It is worth noting that at the US's inception the model of government was a united body of autonomous states. The idea is, anything that wasn't clear cut can be filled in by new regulation as necessary (better to address problems as they come than create problems trying to predict them) or by the individual states making up the union. Today there is still debate how much of these clear definitions should be filled in by state or federal governments, but the results of the Civil War pretty much killed any hope to return to the state autonomy at the US Constitution's original drafting. The Constitution (at the risk of personifying) knows it is imperfect, and contains a procedure on how to build/change it... and we have changed it 27 times. While those first ten changes were made before the Constitution's ratification, this simply illustrates how essential malleability is to the Constitution. So if we have something that is designed to be changed, (though, to be fair the amendment process is pretty damn difficult) why do so many people treat it like a concrete cornerstone of freedom? Well, several reasons. First, as was said earlier, the constitution is a key component of what the US is. If you tie your national identity to your personal identity (read, if you are incredibly nationalistic), you have a vested interest in that constitution being perfect. In some way it's simple cognitive dissonance: I'm an American, America is good, trying to change America is to change/corrupt what is already good. One popular work around of this is the constitutionalist heuristic that the Constitution is \"prefect\" so we need to return to a more strict/classical interpretation. For others, it's a simple case of liking status quo. If you are successful/prospering under the current constitutional model, you have an interest in maintaining that model. Because of this, even benign adjustments are a threat to you, as any new interpretation/amendment to the constitution increases the plausibility of change that might negatively impact your status quo in the future. edit: grammar"}]}
{"id": "1dm4pz", "input": "Why are there so many people (grown-ups) struggeling with depression?", "output": [{"answer": "Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what \"they want to be when they grow up\". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry."}]}

The each have their own style that makes for excellent story telling for the type of movie they are making. Kubrick always seemed to leave things for the viewer to decide the meaning of. He seemed to want his audience to have a \"crisis of self\" during his movies. As a result a lot of his movies can be very unsettling. People tend to love/hate his style, but it is undeniable that they make an impact on the viewer. That impact is the mark of a brilliant director. Whether you like his movies or not, you have to be completely \"switched off\" to not have an experience while watching them. 2001: a space odyssey is famous for this. The exceptional lack of dialogue, requires the viewer to impose themselves on the imagery and fantastically chosen score. It also makes you feel very alone, and in a movie about a journey through space, that can be very uncomfortable. I always feel slightly on edge. Most of his movies are famous for this. I cannot actually think of one that this doesn't apply to. 2001, Full Metal Jacket, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange, etc. all leave the viewer with a variety of feelings about themselves, others, the humanity of mankind, the past and future, and where humans fit in the greater picture (if anywhere). It's pretty rare for a director to be able to inspire those types of emotions in someone, but more often than not Kubrick achieved that with his movies. I think this is, in no small part, why his movies have endured. Spielberg and Hitchcock have their own styles that I think others can probably discuss better. But their styles, and their ability to create emotions with images, actors, and especially sound are a huge part of why their movies are considered to be some of the best ever."}]}

This isn't an ELI5 question at all, it can be solved by googling \"Deutschland Etymology\" and clicking any link on the front page.  URL_0  The name Deutschland and the other similar-sounding names above are derived from the Old High German diutisc, or similar variants from Proto-Germanic *\u00deeudiskaz, which originally meant \"of the people\". Almost every language calls it's country of origin \"the land of the people\". Also, *The terminology for \"Germany\", the \"German states\" and \"Germans\" is complicated by the unusual history of Germany over the last 2000 years. This can cause confusion in German and English, as well in other languages. While the notion of Germans and Germany is older, it is only since 1871 that there has been a nation-state of Germany. Later political disagreements and the partition of Germany (1945-1990) has further made it difficult to use proper terminology*. *Starting with Charlemagne, the territory of modern Germany was within the realm of the Holy Roman Empire. It was a union of relatively independent rulers who each ruled their own territories. This empire was called in German Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich, with the addition from the late Middle Ages of Deutscher Nation (of (the) German nation), showing that the former idea of a universal realm had given way to a concentration on the German territories.* For additional reading: *Roman authors mentioned a number of tribes they called Germani\u2014the tribes did not themselves use the term. After 1500 these tribes were identified by linguists as belonging to a group of Germanic language speakers (which include modern languages like German, English and Dutch). Germani (for the people) and Germania (for the area where they lived) became the common Latin words for Germans and Germany.* *In 19th and 20th century historiography, the Holy Roman Empire was often referred to as Deutsches Reich, creating a link to the later nation state of 1871. Besides the official Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation, common expressions are Altes Reich (the old Reich) and R\u00f6misch-Deutsches Kaiserreich* (Roman-German Imperial Realm)*. And finally, if you are a foreigner, it's good to note that while the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) is the complete country; \"Westdeutschland\" and \"Ostdeutschland\" are still the names for eastern and western Germany. Most people from Bavaria (Bayern) normally appreciate if you call them Bavarian even though they fall into Westdeutschland technically. **Edit:** Good work, downvote a comment that actually calls someone out for breaking the first rule of this subreddit. \"E is for explain.

{"id": "80rpvd", "input": "Why does the urge for chewing, tapping, etc. help with anxiety or focus? What do nervous habits accomplish?", "output": [{"answer": "Fidgeting, tapping, and chewing can be self-stimulatory behaviors that serve to give a sense of control to ease anxiety. You can often see the most extreme forms of self-stimming occur in individuals with ASD, where self-stimming works as a protective response to being overwhelmed with sensory stimuli in the environment. The person self-stimming can block out less predictable environmental stimuli via chewing, flapping, rocking, spinning objects, pacing, or whatever. All these behaviors fall under the umbrella of stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, which is one aspect important to the assessment and diagnosis of ASD. Furthermore, anxiety is extremely comorbid in ASD, which is why I'm even talking about it at all here. Though to a lesser degree, anxious individuals may also try to lessen their anxiety by gaining control over their environment and easing worries via certain behaviors to try and calm the mind by blocking out stimuli with their nervous habit. In regards to ADHD and repetitive behaviors, which is also pretty highly comorbid with anxiety by the way, we see that engaging the primary motor cortex by doodling or fidgeting with something allows brain to better selectively attend to a stimulus at hand, because it's not trying to inhibit a desire to attend to something else in the environment or engage in some kind of active movement (by already fidgeting/doodling). Think of someone mindlessly doodling in class while still paying attention to the lecture. For some people, doodling would take their attention away and distract them from listening to the content of the lecture. For ADHD brains (which suffer executive function deficits of the prefrontal cortex), by allowing them to mindlessly doodle/fidget during the lecture (which isn't requiring sustained attention to do), they are better able to selectively attend (and sustain that attention) on the content of the lecture. They don't have to inhibit anything else in the environment that might be distractible, because the PFC and motor strip are already engaged in something, freeing up neurocognitive (attentional and working memory) resources to focus on the lecture content. I know there was a few different things mentioned here, but there is a lot of overlap between anxiety, ADHD, and autism symptomatology. I evaluate children with all three at work, so let me know if you have any further questions."}]}
{"id": "59ni0w", "input": "How do we decide what is a war crime and what is not?", "output": [{"answer": "This is a great question. This was actually a key reason for the unbelievable brutality of the Eastern Front in WW2. A war crime is established by treaties during peacetime. The main purpose of it is to limit the scope of wars, so that it does not cause more destruction than necessary. The large modern treaties that the world observes these days were established during two massive conferences in the Hague, Netherlands, in 1899 and 1907. A famous later addendum was added to these during a conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1929. One reason that countries want to adopt and observe these standards is that it protects their own people. If you don't want your civilians killed, you don't want your soldiers tortured, then you adopt a treaty banning it and you stick to it. The German Wehrmacht was famous for bending and breaking these standards during their surprise invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Hitler was always planning to invade the Soviet Union as part of his Lebensraum plan (displacing and exterminating untermench Slavs to create new living space for the noble Aryan Germans.) As part of the invasion, Hitler specifically defined tactics that would broaden who would qualify as a \"combatant\" under these treaties, and used this legalism to wipe out huge numbers of Russian, Lithuanian, Belorussian, and most especially Ukrainian civilians. This led to a general attitude within the Wehrmacht of disregard for the human rights of all Soviet civilians and prisoners of war. Unfortunately for Hitler, the Soviet Union was much stronger than he anticipated, and were able to mount defenses of Moscow, Kursk, Leningrad (St. Petersburg) and Stalingrad (Volgograd) that were very costly to the Wehrmacht. The Red Army's repulsion of Germany and its subsequent invasion of German-held territories in Eastern Europe were then treated with the same disdain of human rights. Very few Germans - combatants or non-combatants - who were captured in these territories ever returned home. Rape became incredibly common. The horror that the Germans experienced at the hands of the Red Army was unspeakable, but the worst part of it for the Germans was that they knew they had brought it on themselves. Germans in East Prussia and Berlin were well aware of what was coming, because it was revenge for everything they had done on the way East. They had forfeited the protection of these treaties, because they had violated them so egregiously. As a result, if you exclude every single other death in WW2 except for the Eastern Front, it's still the largest and most destructive war in human history - this is acknowledged by all parties, even when there are large discrepancies between sources and so much missing information. Even at its lowest estimate, it dwarfs every other human conflict. And the reason, largely, is failing to obey these war crime agreements. TL;DR war crimes treaties are the idea of \"don't-start-no-shit-won't-be-no-shit\" taken to an international level.

It's because people who argue for climate change aren't just saying \"it happens\" as an academic issue like \"2+2=4\"...they want others to *give up* something for it. \"Hey climate change...so stop using cheap fossil fuels and use more expensive alternative sources of energy\" or \"Hey climate change...so pay this carbon tax.\" 2. The effects of climate change are difficult to observe to the casual layman. We don't directly feel temperatures increasing year to year (sure, there's instruments, but I mean the typical person doesn't really feel it), when it's fractions of a degree. So you're basically relying on computer models and such which the typical person isn't really going to understand. It's not something that you can just demonstrate as a backyard experiment. 3. People in this thread have speculated on the motivations of people who deny climate change, i.e. \"because they're paid by the oil industry\" or whatever, but don't consider that the *proponents* of climate change seek to improve on their own situations as well (and I don't mean \"we save Earth\", I mean financially). For example, funding for studying climate change depends on the extent to which people can convince the moneyholders in the government that it's a real problem deserving money to study. The proposed solutions to climate change have pretty uniformly been to increase taxes and/or regulations, which politicians like because it increases their power (not to mention the money and power of climate change experts, since politicians need consultants on those tax schemes and regulations). The people setting up carbon markets and such are profiting from it. Basically, there are pretty good reasons why proponents of climate change stand to individually profit from it. 4. There's also debate over the extent to which current climate change is human-driven, versus just natural variations due to the number of sunspots or other factors. So basically the proponents of climate change are arguing that people should give them more money and power due to something the typical person can't observe (but the proponents say \"I've got the data, trust me!\"), when the proponents themselves seek to benefit financially from it, at a loss for the people they're aiming to convince. That's the hurdle that climate change proponents basically have to clear. As an analogy, say someone goes to your house and says \"You know, your house is in danger of being broken into. You could lose everything or even die!\" You respond with \"Well I haven't noticed any burglaries or robberies in the area lately\", to which the someone responds \"They're there! I have data proving this! You know, I could take care of this problem for you if you let me set up a surveillance system for the low, low cost of $1000 a month...\" People will naturally have some skepticism for this. It doesn't mean climate change is right, it doesn't mean climate change is wrong, it's just that the field is not exactly permeated with altruistic people, so there's going to be some natural skepticism about it."}]}

Why was the entire internet on Kesha's side against Doctor Luke?", "output": [{"answer": "Or for that matter, look how militant some of the hate against James Deen was last year when that scandal broke. Honestly though, I think it comes down to the nature of rape, and the inherent difficulty in proving allegations either way. It's not like murder, where the action itself it wrong, but instead the \"crime\" here depends upon the second party's willingness. This can lead to a lot of confusion and gray areas, and muddies the waters quite a bit on definitive guilt. If I put the moves on my wife tonight, and she's not really feeling it, but she doesn't actively tell me \"No\", and just lays there and lets it happen, some would say that I've committed rape. I was never given a clear indication that she was not a willing participant, but she didn't want it. Meanwhile I could hookup with some random chick at a club tonight, we've both had too much to drink, and wind up doing something that we might not normally have done. I was just as drunk as her, but if she regrets the decision enough to file charges, I would inevitably be the one facing rape allegations. I'm not trying to weigh in on whether or not any of these actions are or are not rape, but hope to show just how unclear this issue can be. It's almost like if I didn't take the time to get a written and notarized consent prior to the act, then it's questionable. Meanwhile since the only crime here is the willingness of one or both parties, it can be extremely hard to prove in a court of law. Therefore even if Keisha was raped, she's not likely to ever find justice in the legal system. Therefore a lot of people will inherently support someone who makes a rape allegation, simply because it could have happened, but they'll never find justice."}]}

Can't the experienced company programmers defeat the pirates?", "output": [{"answer": "All you have to do is make more money of the DRM than you would have if you didn't include it. Let's simplify and say that including DRM has the following associated costs (we'll ignore 'brand damage', like people not buying future games, and other costs for simplicities sake): -Development costs of the DRM: $500 -Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250 -DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100 -People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100 Loss: $950 However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game. If these people's sales exceed $950, the DRM is worth it. Furthermore, the DRM might be developed for one game, but used for future games, meaning including it in future titles won't even cost the full $500. Having said that, the data isn't usually as clear cut (hard to quantify gained sales vs lost sales for including DRM, for example). However, I think it's fair to say that these companies have some reasonable data supporting their decisions. I'm not entirely convinced that DRM is 'useless' like most people seem to think. It might be, but the mere fact that companies, with access to way more data about their products than us, are so adamant about using it leads me to believe that there must be some argument for it. Or maybe it is costing them money and they just don't have the data to realise it. The point is, whether it's actually good or not isn't just a simple case of \"people hate it\" or \"it'll get cracked anyway\". Another pro-DRM argument is maybe the technology is costing them money on products sold today. But maybe they're just using today's products as guinea pigs to make better DRM for a future generation."}]}
{"id": "4jc1kk", "input": "Other than finding sufficient food, what limits are there on deep-sea creatures' growth?", "output": [{"answer": "I politely disagree with many of those posting here. Let me try to ELI5. Pressure isn't as large of a factor as you might think. It is to us, because we're not adapted to it and our bodies really can't take it. But, we and most other things are actually made out of liquids. Liquid doesn't squish very much. Food is what decides how big things get. If you are thinking about size and think about fish, well, they only get so big. Whale sharks are pretty huge for a fish, but compared to warm blooded mammals, the great whales, they're actually pretty average. Ironically, the largest boney fish - the Sun Fish - spends most of its time quite deep, hunting jellyfish. But it has to come up to the warmer waters near the surface to warm up from time to time. It's hard being cold-blooded. It takes energy to do things and that's why food is such an important factor. Many deeper ocean creatures that are active predators - that hunt for food, instead of just kind of gather it - don't stay in the deep parts all the time. They \"go out for dinner\" coming to the shallows to hunt and then go back down later. Some of these are quite large, especially among jellyfish  & amp; their relatives and squids. It is believed the largest squids in the world live this way. And some of them wouldn't fit in your living room, OP. Even at the bottom there are some big sharks that move about - six gill, seven gill and sleeper sharks can get big - longer and larger than a car. Then there's the mammals that spend a bit of time in the deeper ocean, like sperm whales. They're big. Then there's the things that live down there all the time. The majority of these are small, limited in size mostly due the availability of food. However, on the abyssal plain - the sandy flat part of the ocean between the mountains that form islands and sea mounts and the crevices that form trenches - there are fields and fields of spiny skinned sea stars and sea urchins, walking along in their tube feet, hoovering up food that's slowly sunk down to the bottom. They move in giant herds. There's so many, and the area is so big - it's the single largest habitat on Earth - that they might actually be the largest amount of animals on the planet, by weight. That's despite what everyone says about bugs. Beetles. Everyone thinks they're so cool. But then there's the bottoms of the trenches. So far there's no Pacific Rim sized Kayju down there that we've found, but when you stop thinking fish and start thinking other things there's some real possibility. Hydrothermic vents are these cracks in the sea floor where really hot (like hotter than boiling) water comes shooting out, full of chemicals. There are creatures that can live next to these vents and live in the water who use the chemicals in the water for food. There's a type of tube worm that lives there that can stand hotter than boiling water, that has no digestive tract - no tummy, no intestines and never goes poop - that is over 1 metre long. That may not sound all that big, but that's pretty huge for a tube worm. They appear to be limited in size by the size of the vents they live on. Vents are little underwater volcanos. Get a big one and you get big tube worms. There are some rather large colonial jellyfish types down there that grow to be the size of a football field in length. That's pretty big. Then there's the less impressive - mostly because they don't move around - but really huge bottom dwellers. Deep sea corals can be hundreds of meters long, just like their shallow water counterparts. As corals grow they leave their skeletons behind, which is what makes up reefs. There are massive deep-sea sponges that are thousands of years old. Then there are things like the methane-seep living cyanobacteria colonies. Those things are miles and miles across - bigger than anything on land. I don't expect them to wade ashore to crush Tokyo anytime soon tho. They get massive because they live right next to a food source that's been like an all you can eat buffet for thousands of years, and is still going strong. TLDR: Pressure isn't that big of a deal. It's all about food. EDIT: Removed an elephant to whale shark comparison as it was just plain wrong."}]}

{"id": "1scgrn", "input": "Evolution (former jehovah witness)", "output": [{"answer": "Lots of good responses here. A great parallel to evolution of life is the evolution of computers. We start with the old machines that were just a few vacuum tubes, simple things that could barely calculate basic math. Then we get to the age of the computer dinosaurs... giant machines that would fill a room, were considered state of the art, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Then we have the modern PC, and with it the birth of the Internet. Then the age of laptops. Then cell phones. Then MP3 players. Then tablets. Then smart phones. Now here we are with phones in our cars and frankly a ludicrous amount of technology and power at our fingertips, with new ones on the horizon. One thing you notice with technology is that when something works, and works well, it sticks around for a while. Calculators, one of our oldest computers, are still around in abundance despite changing very little over the last 30 years. Once a breakthrough happens, we get hundreds, if not thousands, of variations on that theme. PCs could vary wildly, but they'd all still have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, hard drive, floppy/CD/DVD drive, etc. Now we've got tablets, which are all flat with a touch screen that controls pretty much everything. Both laptops and phones got smaller and sleeker over time. Storage and memory consistently went up. For cell phones and laptops, size consistently went down, while with PCs, monitor screens consistently got bigger. Technology that is terrible (remember laserdiscs?) tends to fade away very rapidly. So do computers when better computers come out. Residual old computers may linger for a time, but eventually they get replaced by the new and better computers. Remember 5 1/4 inch floppy disks? There was nothing wrong with them, but they got replaced by 3 1/2 inch disks because they were smaller and held more. Those got replaced by CDs, which got replaced by DVDs. Overall, technology has gotten so much better and much more complex over just a short period of time -- only 50ish years or so. What does this have to do with the evolution of life? It's very similar, but much slower (millions of years, not 50) and much more complex. You get one form of life that has a huge advantage over its predecessors, and then they're everywhere, and eventually there are thousands of variations on that one theme. An animal is really good at what it does, even if it's fairly simple? It's not going to change all that much, if at all. Something comes along that's better in every way/many ways? It's probably going to replace the old population of its predecessor. It's not a perfect analogy, of course. But it's a great example of what evolution really is, which is change over time."}]}
{"id": "48vo7s", "input": "Why do places like New York City use a steam network to heat buildings where in other parts of the world use boilers and pipes?", "output": [{"answer": "I am a Mechanical Engineer working in a city that has Steam heating (and chilled water cooling) distributed for almost all of our buildings. One of the benefits to having a steam network compared to hot water boilers all over town is the steam plant is more efficient, both in energy use and in land allocation. Large steam plants also gain efficiency by heating the \"working fluid\" (in this case, water) to a higher temperature than a boiler typically can and then exchanging that energy with a system that is at a lower temperature. The maximum efficiency of a system (the Carnot efficiency) is determined by the ratio of the highest temperature to the lowest temperature in the heat exchange system (in this case, steam is the high temp and the building air is the low temp). Another reason to use a steam plant versus many, independent boilers, is reliability and cost avoidance. If every building had a boiler in it, every building would need to pay someone, or some company, to maintain that boiler. Most states require that whoever maintains the boiler is a licensed boiler mechanic (and often that includes working on pressure vessels - the boiler itself - which can be its own certification). Mechanics, especially those with a boiler certification, are expensive to employ. Then we get into all the fun things like replacing major components (the heating element in the boiler, for example) every 10-20 years and minor components (like valves and seals) every 5-10 years. Steam plants can accomplish all the same things, with a higher efficiency, at a fraction of the overhead cost. This also acts as a nice tax-revenue supplement for the city, if the city runs the plant. Now, for the second part of your question. New York, as mentioned by u/YouAintGotToLieCraig, is a good example of why many cities do not use district heating (which is the industry name for what we have been talking about). The city is old, and was mostly developed prior to the rise of the technology to effectively implement district heating. Once a city is built up, it is extremely difficult to go back through and add in anything that requires underground work. That goes for district heating, district cooling (although New York might not be a good place for district cooling for a different reason), subways, underground power lines, etc. For the utilities side, every building would not only need to have the roads around it torn up (and as I understand traffic is already pretty bad in New York) but it would need to have a hole cut in its wall below street level. If the building is older than 20ish years, asbestos will be everywhere. I don't know about New York, but where I live, as soon as we touch asbestos we have to either clean it **all** up or seal it in permanently. Nothing to do with asbestos is even relatively cheap. It can sink a project right off the bat because it will cost too much. Other places may not use it for a variety of reasons. In other parts of the world, mechanics may not have to be licensed at all. It could just be someone who knows how to use tools. There also may be a cooperation barrier. District heating requires that everyone on the network cooperate to reduce downtime and to allow maintenance workers into their buildings. I could probably go on about this some more (combined heating and power anyone?), but I won't. This is already getting a little long I think. **tl;dr - Steam heating is more efficient and costs less to operate but requires a massive construction effort to implement in more developed cities.**"}]}

{"id": "25rswc", "input": "How do military/police dogs distinguish between a target under pursuit and non-targets such as civilians and other servicemen, and how often does this go awry?", "output": [{"answer": "Dog quarry here (I'm the guy who wears the suit/sleeve and gets bit by the dogs in training). Disclaimer: I'm not a dog trainer per se, I play my role and must know a certain amount about dog training and body language but I'm no expert on dogs. I can share my experience though. The handlers will generally cue the dogs onto a person with a command that tells them that they might get to bite someone soon (something like \"watch him/her!\"), the dogs get really excited when they hear this, usually start barking and pulling on their leash/harness - the handler will usually watch and wait until the dog is looking at the right person or in the right direction before saying it so the dog get's the reward of the command when they are looking at the correct person and they will get a \"leave it\" or something like that if they look at the wrong person (it's pretty clear who they're looking at usually because their ears are perked up and they look directly straight at the person so from behind the dog the handler can see exactly where they're looking). With that command, the dog is now fully alert and itching to get a bite. The dog will read everyone's body language as well and whoever is acting the most aggressive or most nervous and twitchy will trigger the prey drive. However this type of prey drive is not necessary for the dog to focus/bite - if the handler has been able to cue the dog on the correct person, it is also trained to deploy on a seemingly passive person (passive as in not moving around much, not peaceful). So you can't avoid a bite by just playing dead or not acting aggressive or not running - they're trained for that quite a bit as it can initially be a problem for many dogs. We quarries do lots of different types of body language behaviour during training such as pacing, yelling, backing away, puffing up, waving arms, simply talking to the cop with a dismissive tone (\"Ahhh get outta here, what did I do wrong?\") anything that a nervous/aggressive/uncooperative person might do in this situation, so the dogs know what they're looking for. They also train with other cops around the dog and around the target so they get used to people being near the target and know they don't bite people who are acting a certain way toward them (dogs are really good at following humans' gaze too so it helps that in a situation many people are likely to be focusing on the suspect and the dog will do the same). We even train the dogs to bite a target person who is fighting a cop already - so even when they are grappling, the dog knows who's who. They're really smart, they're not just a biting machine that will tear up anything that gets close enough. They are able to discriminate due to the extensive training they get. The dogs are also socialized really well with all types/ages of people, so they are very well-versed in what appropriate human behaviour looks like and what is out of the ordinary. Lots of bites will happen on-leash where this isn't even an issue, while only a fleeing person will cause them to let the dog go and by that point the dog is typically very clear on who it is they're after, and they've got that \"missile lock\" thing going on. I've never seen an in-service dog focus on the correct person and then suddenly switch and bite someone else just because they're closer - they know the game and they know that's not okay. I don't know how often this goes awry, but I've never heard of it happening within the police department I work for. The handlers will not let the dog go unless they are \"missile locked\" on the correct person. It is possible that a dog could cue onto the wrong person in an ambiguous situation, so it is up to the handler to use their judgment and only send the dog for a bite if they know the dog is not confused about who the target is. That's up to their experience and knowledge of their dog. Edit: Grammar/spelling"}]}

Cooked meat is a lot easier to digest. The cooking process breaks it down a bit before you even start to chew it. It's easier to eat it and easier to digest. Somewhere long ago we discovered to cooking process and it became easier to get nutrition from meat and, as other people pointed out, it suddenly was easier to preserve and it got rid of some pesky parasites. Overall a win-win. All right, now look in the mirror. Go on. I'll wait. Look at your mouth. Now look at the mouth of a typical carnivore. Not just the teeth. Look at the shape of the mouth. The snout specifically. Doesn't it seem humans have a rather small mouth? Yes we do. That's part of the reason braces are so common for teeth. Humans have a lot of teeth crammed in a really small mouth. Heck, wisdom teeth are yet another reminder that our mouths used to be much larger. So why are our mouths so much smaller? Well, cooking is part of it. When we started cooking food the food got softer. Softer food doesn't need quite as much power or grinding action to break it down. As our diet shifted and we really didn't need those huge jaws things gradually scaled down a bit. So, now we're in a bit of a bind. We've been cooking food for so long (really before the species we now think of a \"human\" existed) that our bodies have adapted to it. We can certainly eat raw meat. It's not necessarily a good idea and it takes a lot of effort, but the ability to digest it never really went away. Now if you are asking \"why don't carnivores have to worry about parasites or other food born illnesses?\" the answer is that they do. Some parasites and bacteria are rather species specific, though. So the bacteria that would really make, say, a dog sick may not a thing to a human. The reverse is true as well. Plus eating a kill when it is fresh before bacteria start trying to decompose the tissue helps as well. But the real big thing is that if an animal eats contaminated meat it gets sick and possible dies. This happens all the time. It then becomes something else's meal. Humans like to increase our odds of survival and prefer our meals to carry less risk overall. If sticking it over a fire to kill off anything that might be trying to make a meal out of it before we have a chance to take a crack at it gives us an edge, we'll take it."}]}

First of all, \"eye floaters\" are not a) just lint and shit that fell into your eye or b) unusually upstart sperm that got really really lost. Your eyes are mostly made up of a jelly called vitreous fluid, and this gel undergoes many changes as you age. As it slowly shrinks, it loses its smoothness and starts to look stringy.

So technically, they're your little buddies for life. As for the bright dots that flash and move in front of your eyes, they're called phosphenes, and they're caused when cells in your retina are messed with (by rubbing your eyes or having a large person slap you in the dark), causing them to misfire.

Wow. Not even close. The difference between artist money and executive money typically runs to one or two more zeroes at the end of the paycheck. You hear about Brad Pitt getting paid $25 million to do a single movie, but you DON'T hear about the film's producer, who will walk away with maybe ten times that, maybe a LOT more, depending on how profitable the film is. Furthermore, Pitt might only make that much once every 2-3 years, while your typical big company CEO is banking $25 million every year. PLUS bonuses. And of course, whether you're talking movies, music, or sports, there are only a *very* tiny handful of people who are making big bucks like that. Meanwhile every big studio executive is hauling in phat bucks day in and day out. The very richest people in show biz are management, no exceptions. Oprah Winfrey isn't the richest woman in show biz because she does a talk show, she made all that cash because she's the head of a media corporation. The reason people are--properly--increasingly viewing CEOs as greedy thieves is because the worker/executive pay disparity has gotten obscenely out of control. Worker to executive pay is typically expressed as a ratio, which makes it independent of inflation, so you can usefully compare numbers from the past and present. Back in the 1960s, that ratio was around 1:30. Today, in the US, it's hovering around 1:390. When you DO account for inflation, the American worker has not had a raise since about the 70s. And meanwhile that executive pay just keeps going up. Where does all that money come from? Yup: a fair part of it comes from the kitty they USED to pay workers with. The disparity is MUCH lower in the rest of the industrialized world, but even so, some countries are trying to put the brakes on it. Switzerland recently held a referendum to limit the ratio to 1:12.

No car, no insurance necessary. Many don't have a car because they don't need it (as they can walk to use public transport) or that they can't afford it (as their income is too low). On the other hand, while not everyone has a car, everyone has their health to take care of. As mentioned before, some people already have low incomes such that they can't buy insurance, and now they are forced to purchase something they can't afford. Or can they...? Proponents of the mandated insurance say that by making health insurance mandatory, it will force insurance companies to be competitive and lower prices such that they will be able to take in more people. Part of the way insurance works is that it does get less expensive for both the company and the people they cover as more people buy into it. Now that everyone has to buy it (or rather everyone needs to be covered if you want to change perspectives), companies are supposed to scramble over each other so that they stay in business by trying to attract the most people. Thus, everybody wins; companies get their money and people get their health care. But that's theoretical for the most part, but proponents have cited the car insurance mechanisms as their proof. But here is the second reason why people don't like the idea of the mandated health insurance: people don't trust that the \"competition\" part of the mandated health insurance plan will play out, given the track record of corporations these days. The mandated health insurance plan at it's core relies on economics (which has proven itself to be a failure) and ideal conditions (which will never occur, which is why we call it ideal), so many are unwilling to rely on a system which is based on what they believe is broken from the start. EDIT: It seems like a lot of people were pinning some reasons on Obama and his race. Ironically, mandated health insurance is the most capitalistic type of plan, a far cry from the belief that he is a socialist. That said, if you want the more simplistic answer to why some are bitter about this plan, then yes, it's a race/party issue, which extends to issues of willful ignorance.

I can tell you that Americans in general are far less apt to following rules, especially traffic ones. I think this is a cultural thing. I think the sheer amount of space available in the US is a factor. But if we were to go more in depth, Americans have long had a tradition of independence that stems from the exploration of the frontier and the rough days when we were a British colony. Once we won our independence, immigration from all sorts of countries exploded and this encouraged that independent, diverse spirit further. Very distinct groups formed and I believe this prevented a universal adherence to rules imposed on the people by the state governments. This in turn affected the overall culture of the average American. According to a lot of Europeans, Americans are somewhat disorganized and chaotic. I seem to remember a quote from a German general after World War 2: \"The reason why the Americans are so good at war is because war is chaos and Americans practice chaos on a daily basis.\""}]}
{"id": "27jjg1", "input": "Why are there so many shootings in America?", "output": [{"answer": "It's hard to pin down a single reason, and it's also very difficult to be objective. It's easy to say that America has the most liberal gun laws of western industrialised nations and also the highest intentional homicide rate of western industrialised nations not currently in a state of war, but it might be slightly more complicated than that. For example, Germany has some of the world's strictest gun laws and does have a very low murder rate compared with the US, but the worst school shootings in recent decades have taken place in Germany. It is very hard to escape the fact that liberal gun laws coupled with a general culture of violence plus inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders are to blame, but to what extent each of these factors is to blame is not easy to determine. If we pick on just the gun ownership aspect, the cases normally raised in these discussions are Switzerland and Australia. Switzerland has a very high incidence of legal gun ownership, but the usual explanation that \"all Swiss citizens are legally required to have guns\" isn't quite accurate. In fact, most Swiss males in their twenties and thirties are conscripted into the militia, and are required to take their service weapons home with them -- but are not allowed to take any ammunition. (In the past, ammunition was issued in sealed boxes, and the seals were constantly checked and the bullets counted.) Still, most Swiss households have guns, and it is possible to get hold of ammunition. And it is true that despite that, Switzerland has a very low murder rate. Interestingly, though, while planned crimes -- armed robbery, for example -- are typically carried out using illegally held weapons, there is a higher-than-expected rate of domestic homicides -- crimes of passion -- and these are carried out using legally-held service weapons. So if you want to hold up a bank, you get a gun on the black market that can't be traced to you; if you catch your wife in bed with the insurance salesman, you grab the nearest weapon to hand which happens to be a gun. Similarly, there is this thing going round that guns are now banned in Australia and that as a result the murder rate has shot up. Neither of those things are true: guns were restricted in 1996, but not banned, in Australia, and the murder rate appears to have gone down but was always very low anyway. Different researchers have come up with very different interpretations of the same figures, but it seems that gun crime was on the way down anyhow, and the 1996 legislation didn't make much difference. The only thing anyone can say for sure is that fewer suicides are committed using guns, which just means that people determined to kill themselves are turning to different methods. TL;DR: It's much more complex than lots of people will have you believe, but it is almost certainly a mixture of many different factors."}]}
{"id": "27hd7v", "input": "Grammar--what is the logic behind not ending a sentence with a preposition?", "output": [{"answer": "In English, a preposition requires an object (sometimes called a referent). Think of these sentences:  > I gave the donut *to* Blurgette.  > I received an upvote *from* Blurgette. The idea is that the sentence is less comprehensible if the preposition and the referent are separated and in general this makes sense. In current usage, people tend to end sentences with prepositions when they form questions. The structure is a bit more complicated here. In a declarative (non-question sentence), the typical word order is *subject, verb, direct object, indirect object*:  > Blurgette gave the upvote to FinanceITGuy. As a question, the formal structure of the sentence should be *indirect object, subject, verb, direct object*:  > To whom did Blurgette give the upvote? To many people, this usage feels stilted and overly formal, so you hear many questions structured like this:  > Who did Blurgette give the upvote to? This usage is commonly accepted in informal usage, but it drives grammarians crazy. The reason for the aggravation is at least as much due to the use of the nominative pronoun 'who' (which should be used to indicate the subject of the sentence) in place of the dative pronoun 'whom' (which indicates the recipient of the verb's action) as it is to the shockingly naked pronoun at the end of the sentence. In conclusion, one of my favorite grammar jokes describes an alternate resolution to this issue: A young man is accepted to Harvard. He is the first one from his family to attend a university and he is not used to formal English grammar. His first day on campus he is exploring the grounds and asks an upperclassman: \"Where is the library at?\" The older student looks down his nose and says \"Sir, here at Harvard we do not end our sentences with prepositions.\" The new student pauses for a moment and then says, \"I see, excuse me. Where is the library at, asshole?\""}]}

{"id": "1uxi6n", "input": "How do internet service providers work and is it possible for me to connect to the internet without them?", "output": [{"answer": "The internet is just a collection of data networks run by different companies. If you use *A* as your service provider and you visit a website hosted on a server on *A*'s network, the data can be routed internally (within the service provider's own network) without passing through the rest of the internet. If you use *A* as your service provider and you visit a website hosted on a server on *B*'s network, the data may be routed one of two ways: **Direct Peering Connections:** In this scenario, *A* and *B* mutually agree to establish a direct peering connection between their respective networks. The peering connection will be faster, less congested and better performing than alternative routing paths and will allow subscribers of *A*'s service to reach websites etc. hosted on *B*'s network and vice versa. The peering connection will be established at carrier neutral facilities / data centers where many different service providers are able to interconnect with each-other sometimes through a switching fabric / internet exchange service. These facilities are located in major cities all around the world, and if *A* and *B* are large enough, they will establish peering connections at multiple facilities. When *A*'s network and *B*'s network are roughly the same size and/or have similar amounts of data traffic, both network providers will usually agree to peer for free (since the peering connection is mutually beneficial for both parties). If one of the networks is significantly larger then (or dumps too much traffic on) the other network, a paid peering arrangement may sometimes occur. Paid peering connections are sometimes seen as violating the principle of Net Neutrality since it means one service provider is essentially paying for the privilege of having a faster/better connection (i.e. a 'fast highway lane') to the other network whereas other companies who can't afford to peer have to rely on slower routes via IP transit connections. **IP Transit Connections:** If *A* and *B* cannot or do not wish to peer directly with each other (for a variety of different reasons), the only way to pass data between the networks is via a third-party transit provider which connects to both networks. In this case, the data from *A* gets routed through a transit provider *C* which then passes the data on to *B* where it eventually reaches its destination. Transit links or backbone connection are often more congested and slower performing as compared to peering links. Thus, service providers who peer with hundreds of other networks will generally be able to provide better internet service then a smaller provider who only peers with one or two networks and relies mostly on IP transit.  >  Is it possible for me to connect to the internet just by myself and not through an isp? No. Even if you wired a fiber optic connection directly to the nearest carrier netural facility, none of the carriers would agree to peer with you. The best you could do would be pay an IP transit service for bandwidth (i.e. a backbone connection) and then that IP transit provider would effectively become your internet service provider (however it would be a much better carrier-class service, not the residential service you get at home). The cost of IP transit services would be approximately $1-5 per megabit. So a 100 Mbit connection may cost $100-500 per month. However, this only covers the cost of internet access, you would still have to pay to install and rent the fiber line to your home which would be prohibitively expensive."}]}

I'm a lawyer. In most jurisdictions, there are only three requirements for a will to be considered \"legal.\" (1) It must be in writing. (2) It must be signed by the testator (the person whose will it is). (3) It must be witnessed by a certain number of disinterested parties (the number depends on the jurisdiction). So, why can't you just make your own will? Short answer: You can. In fact, depending on your specific situation, a will may be complicating things unnecessarily. (That said, it's a good idea for most people). Then why should you consult a lawyer? Because even though those you only need those three requirements, there are nuances to it. For example, a lawyer can help you structure the will (through the use of trusts and other devices) to avoid taxes. Further, lawyers have to keep abreast of changes in the law. That is supposed to make us aware if, for example, a court has a ruling that would affect the way a will is construed, we should change the way we are drafting wills to take that into account. A lawyman may not know that, and if you are using a form from the internet, chances are it hasn't been updated. If there are problems in the will, chances are you will have to spend more money on a lawyer as the will goes through probate than you will have spent on a lawyer drafting the will to begin with."}]}

The broadcast world uses aspect ratios of 16x9, e.g, 1920x1080, or 3840 x 2160. In cinema, there are two overall aspect ratios depending what the content is, if your film is 1.78 - 2.0, people tend to use a flat container, meaning the image is scaled into a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio, introducing letterbox if the active image aspect ratio is greater than 1.89:1. For titles with aspect ratios larger than 2, e.g 2.4 or 2.35 or 2.39 and more, they'll use the frame called scope, which has a pixel aspect ratio or 1.5:1. Basically so they can squeeze more content into a frame, in this case preserving the vertical information more so than the horizontal. When the image is projected, the image is unsqueezed, preserving more detail or image than would exist in a flat container. Broadcast/ consumer electronics are more restricted, in order to broadcast over the air, the distribution architecture decided on 16x9. Some televisions do support digital cinema initiative frames, many 4K capable televisions will squeeze 4096x2160 content into a 3840x2160 frame.

Northern Europeans have better tolerance for lactose next to Southern Europeans and Asians. There's also more and better land for breeding cows, especially if you compare to Greece or Italy where the land has been so severely over-farmed, there's not much growing there anymore. Nutrition certainly plays a role on this too, but some differences between countries from similar regions can't be explained by that. Sami people for example (the only indigenous people of Europe) seem to be significantly shorter regardless of living in Northern Europe (for the longest). Or other speakers of the Finno-Ugric language family, despite living relatively North are shorter than their neighbors. Presumably due to genetic differences, since they're not as closely related to other Europeans. Finns even have a weird thing for milk (a milk company had a monopoly and affected a lot of studies advertising milk as super healthy for quite some time) and are one of the healthiest populations in Europe, yet they're barely the same height as Germans. Curiously enough, Basques, who are a small people in Northern Spain, also have better lactose persistence, and the name Basques has been theorized to have come from Celtic etymology meaning something like \"the mountain people\" or \"the tall ones\". I didn't find any statistics for their height specifically though, presumably they're always grouped with Spaniards. There's no clear answer though, what I found through brief research."}]}

If there's a danger your body tells you to flight or fight. So those feelings make us realize that we need to do something. So when you feel alone and it's dark, you feel more vulnerable.

As mentioned in other comments it really cant be used as an excuse for any crime since it will set a precedent that will allow offenders of other more serious crimes to use in court. As harsh as this may seem, judges will typically take in consideration how clearly the laws are written, and the likely hood that a typical citizen or even law enforcement officer would know/understand. Judges may even hand out a sentence of absolute discharge to guilty individuals based on their misunderstanding or ignorance of the law, especially in cases were the individual sought out advice from law enforcement or regulatory bodies. For example: \"in one Canadian case, a person was charged with being in possession of gambling devices after they had been advised by customs officials that it was legal to import such devices into Canada. Although the defendant was convicted, the sentence was an absolute discharge.\" source:  URL_0  others have mentioned mens rea which is something completely different. Some crimes require mens rea, proof that the individual had an intention to break the law. If an individual was unaware that their actions were violating a law due to the nature of their actions (and not do to a poorly written law) then this will be a valid excuse . In such cases they are not describing the fact that the individual was unaware of the law, but instead the individual knew the law, and did not know they were breaking it. For example unknowingly giving somebody fake currency or unknowingly selling a knock off item as real. In both cases prosecutors must prove that the individual both knew the item was fake before passing it off as genuine in order to prosecute them for fraud"}]}

In physics, nothing is *nothing*: even empty space is a frothing sea of quantum foam with particles spontaneously popping in and out of existence constantly. Inside the universe, there is no such thing as \"nothing\". In that context, from what we think we might possibly know about \"before\" the universe, it's possible that our universe spontaneously sprang from \"nothing\" in the same way that particles out in empty space spring up from \"nothing\". There might be a potential for universes to exist, and our universe is the result of that potential. But that brings up another semantic point: what was \"before\" the universe? Well, there is no \"before\", because time is a function of the universe. You can't say \"before\" the universe because that requires a dimension of time that's moving in one direction. Imagine a line starting at one point and going infinitely off in one direction. What's on the line before it starts? There *is no line* before the line starts.

What's with the 10v difference?", "output": [{"answer": "So attempting an actual ELI5. Because of how power works, voltage in a system can vary due to many factors, including wire length from source(where the power comes from) to load(what uses the power), amount of load on the system, and a bunch of other factors. Because of this, the electrical standard isnt a fixed point, but instead appliances are designed to work within a range of voltages, since it's impossible to predict what exact voltage each instance of it's use will have to work with. Most appliances will work with anything close to it's range, 110,115,120v are all the same to 99% of appliances these days, and the same for 208/220/240v This means in most places you see it written they all mean essentially the same thing. The probable reason you still see things listed at different voltages is due to countries having varied electrical standards. Even though an appliance will work with anything from 200-250v or 100-120v it's labelled to match the standard of the market it's intended for, which depends on both location and use. For an example I see power referred to in North America as 208v in my professional applications (live production lighting) and 240v when referring to stove or dryer plugs. These are the exact same power, from the same mains and will have the same voltage if you measure them, it's just industry standards how they're referred to. Similarly some countries call it 110v, some 120v. In the end anything that works with one will work with the other, it's just history and habit that keep people using one over the other."}]}

(a word derived from the Caucasus mountain region of Central Asia)", "output": [{"answer": "The Caucasus mountains are not in central Asia they are in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Europe and Asia are one land mass (along with Africa) where Europe ends and Asia begins is arbitrary and down to historical reasons. These mountains are one of the arbitrary geographical features that divides Europe from Asia (along with the Urals farther north). In the 19th, or possibly 18th, century a German dude named Blumanbach(?) tried to divide the world up into 3 great races; Negroid were black Africans; Mongoloids were east Asians (what Americans mean when the say \"Asian\"); Caucasoids were European, North African and Asians from Europe to somewhere in India. **This whole thing was psuedoscience** but it did not try to divide people by skin tone, rather it was by skull features. Anyway, this dude had a skull of a woman from Georgia which he designated to have the definitive features of all Caucasoid people and theorized that this was where the first Caucasoid people originated. The term was used in US legal system for who was allowed to enter the USA. So in 1922 when a Japanese dude who had white coloured skin wanted to become naturalised they wouldn't allow him because he wasn't Caucasion, then one year later when a dude from India who was Caucasion said \"hey I want to become a citizen\" the supreme court said \"Yeaaah, about that, we know you are caucasion but we really only meant white caucasions, so fuck you\". Thus to Americans caucasian means people from Europe (although plenty of west Asians and North Africans are white). It is a silly term and shouldn't be used for anyone that's not from the Caucasus region. Also Hispanic and Arabic have nothing to do with skin colour. And when Americans say Asian they don't include about half of Asia. Sometimes Americans will get offended if you point out that Asia includes many more people or that their are white Hispanic and Arabic people, but they are just silly-Billies."}]}

Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, \u201cIt remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.\u201d)  >  Snowden said that he would \u201clove\u201d to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, \u201cI have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they\u2019re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I\u2019m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so.

They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.\u201d So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a \"show\" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently."}]}

{"id": "74kvwg", "input": "Why do we need to use polygons in video games? What causes us to need flat polygons rather than simply having rounded shapes?", "output": [{"answer": "There are two different ways of creating a 2D rendering from a 3D scene: rasterization and ray tracing. **Rasterization** is actually a 2D process and the process used by nearly all video games. How a \"3D\" rasterizing renderer for a video game works is that it takes the 3D scene made up of polygons and then mushes it down into a flat 2D image by scaling the entire world along the camera perspective. Every frame of a video game is actually like a Flash animation: a 2D vector image with a layer for each polygon. The problem though for curved surfaces is that it's really mathematically easy, (using a matrix), to take a specific 3D (x,y,z) position in space (which is called a *vertex*) and flatten it into a 2D place on screen (x,y) based on the camera's perspective. If there are 100,000 points (*vertexes*) in a scene, the renderer only needs to run the squishing algorithm 100,000 times to convert all of the *vertexes'* 3D positions into their 2D position on screen. If a 3D shape though is curvy you not only have to squish the 100k 3D points into 2D points, you also have to mush every point along the curve between those points as seen from the camera and mush that down. That's for all practical purposes mathematically impossible, except in the most simple of cases such as a sphere, which is easy to flatten into a circle. **Raytracing** doesn't necessarily have this problem. Raytracing works by firing rays out from the camera for each pixel and then once each of those rays hits a surface in the 3D scene they render that pixel on screen based on what they hit. Generally speaking for raytracing the ease of calculating where that ray fired out from the camera intersects \"something\" is from easiest to hardest: an infinite plane  <  box  <  a sphere  <  a triangle mesh \\ an arbitrary curved surface. For a ray tracer, intersecting rounded shapes can be as easy to calculate as a triangle, and in some specific cases, like a sphere, the intersection calculation between a ray (line) and the shape (sphere) is easier than a bunch of triangles approximating the shape of a shere. That being said, 90% of all raytracing is just triangles. The reason for that is that nobody really wants to bother with benchmarking which is faster for each individual object in a scene and as a result everybody just defaults to the object type that is on average easiest to all around deal with for the sake of consistency and not having to deal with two different object types. **Bonus, background info that's beyond ELI5** In the case of film, another reason everything is a triangle is that we use something called \"Displacement mapping\". Instead of having a vertex for every little tiny bump and curve of a dragon's scales, we start from a smooth surface and then have the computer push the surface at each point out based on the map. This makes storing the model much more efficient. Instead of trying to simulate the scales (and the necessary million and millions of vertexes) sliding over a muscle, we just simulate the smooth skin sliding over the muscle and add the scale bumpiness as a final step on top. The renderer is generally very good at doing this though efficiently where the surface is only displaced based on how big it is on screen. There is no reason to have lots of displacement if the dragon is 10 pixels tall. For film\\tv\\commercials where quality is paramount usually the number of vertexes internally in the renderer will be equal to the density of the pixels on screen. Since every pixel already has its own vertex there is no reason to use smooth curvy surfaces. **Bonus Bonus** There are some games which mix polygon and non polygonal renderers and then merge them. For instance some games which used giant worlds would do a first-pass on a voxel world and then layer on the polygon characters. Some games also do implicit rendering of some simple shapes instead of using polygons. Since a game engine effectively layers every pixel anyway, it's really easy to to mix and match how each layer is rendered with different rendering techniques. So it's not quite right to say \"All games use rasterizers and polygons\" since many big blockbuster games also mix and match renderers where necessary. For instance I think the Quake 3 engine supported rendering implicit (curved) walls. Although I can't find any documentation of that fact."}]}
{"id": "6f2ziq", "input": "Why and how is the US allowed to have military bases all over the world?", "output": [{"answer": "Multiple considerations here. For one, the US is largely geographically isolated from the world's geopolitical hot spots. In the 20th century, that was Europe. These past 20 years, the Middle East. In this century, it may well become Asia. As a result of lessons learned from WW2, the US has maintained that it's best defense is to keep forces and the capability to keep forces overseas. That means a Navy that can deliver men and materiel overseas and the ability to defend them from submarines and aircraft. That means an Air Force that has hundreds of aerial refueling tankers and strategic airlift transports (e.g., the US has over 400 tankers and 220 strategic transports - the rest of NATO nations combined have a grand total of around 40 dedicated tankers and 20 strategic transports). But on the other end, you need bases for said troops and materiel to be put at. Hence nations come into agreement with the US to station troops in their nation. Contrary to popular belief, these aren't imposed on the host nations - not now, anyways. Nations must sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the US to station troops. A SOFA states the legal rights of US troops in host nation - for instance, a SOFA in the UAE woild bar US troops from being subject to local Sharia laws we disagree with. You'll note too that the four nations with the most US troops overseas are Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Italy. Three of those four are the vanquished Axis foes of WW2. As a result of various treaties to end the war, those nations were occupied by US and Allied forces, which is how many of these bases came into US hands. Heck, the UK still has British Forces Germany - a contingent of 5000 that aren't due to depart until 2020, a full 75 years after the war ended! In addition to economic and political benefits of US troops stationed overseas (a lot of developing nations get money poured in from it, and it's a source of employment for locals too), South Korea is a good example of another reason nations may want us. By keeping US troops in the country and along the DMZ, any attack by North Korea will inevitably kill Americans. That guarantees the US would respond. These tripwire forces are a big reason Poland and other Eastern European nations are more than happy to station US troops there, even as Western Europe is less happy about them. I want to add too that the US has **simultaneous** defense treaties with NATO and Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. A war with North Korea does not absolve the US of fulfilling it's defense treaty with Europe if they get in a fight with Russia. As thus, the US prefers to keep forces overseas to stop it from getting to a fight in the first place. Finally, European and Asian militaries benefit from reciprocal agreements. Not only do those nations get to train directly with their American counterparts, but they have agreements to use US bases in the US. That's right, we have foreign troops stationed in the US. Did you know that the German Air Force has squadrons stationed in the US at Holloman AFB in New Mexico and NAS Pensacola in Florida? Hell, did you know that tiny Singapore - yes, Singapore - has FOUR Air Force squadrons stationed in the US. The vast airspace and land we have allows a lot of smaller nations to train. And they get the benefit of a US alliance? It's a no brainer for a lot of nations"}]}

Most american's consume American cereal lagers and do so at very cold temperatures. This [style of lager]( URL_0 ) is not known for its taste in warm temperatures. I think it is safe to say most agree that it tastes terrible unless very cold. Many American's people associate this style with relaxing on a warm caribbean beach. I believe this is unique to the Americas, north, central and south. In Europe you'll find plenty of pilsner style and especially predominant in around the mediterranean but you will also equally find various other more complex styles. In the United States adjunct lagers are widely dominant especially when you leave areas where craft brewing has become popular. It has become a cultural aspect of the America's that these cereal based or adjunct lagers are what is thought of when discussing beer and also the cold temperatures that go along with them. I certainly could not imagine drinking a budweiser warm, yuck. Many, if not most, beer styles should be consumed slightly chilled or warmer and are most enjoyable in that range. Keep in mind beer was made long before refrigeration came about. Many more complex recipe's will lose their flavor if over chilled. These adjunct lagers are an exception to the typical 4 ingredient rule. IMHO they taste gross and if given the opportunity I'd drink something else anyways. Just as someone else called out Whiskey works the same way. Much of the flavor is lost if it is over chilled. Long story short, to repeat /u/stumbleOn , it is most cultural."}]}

In laymans' terms it means that the strength of an object decreases as it gets larger if the same density is kept because the volume of that object increases much faster than its surface area. This means that proportionately the skeletal structures of animals have to get much stronger to be able to handle stress. If an ant was scaled up to the size of a human while its exoskeleton remained the same, it would probably collapse under its own weight. If a human was scaled up to the size of an elephant, we would break our legs trying to stand up. As a consequence, small animals can take a lot of fall damage because their bones are proportionately stronger than ours for their size."}]}
{"id": "odr17", "input": "The opposition in America to a National Health Plan", "output": [{"answer": "It seems like the answers here are going to be fairly liberally biased (which I would more or less expect). I am also socially liberal and support expanded healthcare in the U.S., but I will try to answer your question in a way that's fair to both sides. In the United States, the idea of capitalism is one that's been engrained in our culture for decades now. This is due in most part to our tussles with various communist nations, especially the USSR, during the mid-to-late 20th century. Capitalism isn't just the idea that \"socialized medicine\" is automatically a step toward communism (although that can be part of it as well), but it's the idea that more economic and governmental weight in society should be placed on the notion that those who earn more should get to have more. That is, someone who contributes a large amount to society on his/her own and earns a lot of money for the responsibility should not have to contribute as much of that success toward others in society who do not contribute as much; **the idea is that the more that is given to those who contribute less to society, the more imbalanced the capitalist ideal is, because we reward behavior that is antithetical to a well-run market economy.** Note that we're talking about individuals, not groups; yes it's true that the U.S. economy would be in the toilet without factory workers, but ONE factory worker is not worth as much because he is easily replaceable. One CEO (in theory) is worth a lot because you couldn't just give any guy on the street his job with the expectation that he would be successful. Now, socialized medicine is an example of increasing the economic reward to those who do not contribute as much to society on their own. In this model, the CEO (for example) makes a ton of money each year because he has the most responsibility at a company like, say, Wal Mart, which contributes untold billions to the U.S. economy. This person makes a lot of money for what he does, and in a capitalist society, money equals freedom; the more money you have, the more closely you can do what you want and tailor your lifestyle to your ideal. One of the freedoms that comes from having money, and thus as a tradeoff for having the burden of national economic responsibility, is that you can purchase something like healthcare, which almost invariably improves your quality of life. This is a reward for the contributions you make to society. Now, further down the food chain, you have the middle class. These people do contribute a ton to society, but not as much as the upper class. These people do have money to spend on healthcare, but they would have to forgo other things in order to do that; their economic contribution is not as high, so they lack the financial freedom afforded to those whose contribution is higher. When they buy health insurance, it can be a real sacrifice, because maybe now they can't send their kid to as fancy a school as they wanted, or live in as nice a house as they wanted. There are tradeoffs, but they work hard enough to earn the ability to have a reasonable amount of comfort and financial freedom. With socialized medicine, the upper class would be helping to partially subsidize the healthcare of the middle class; this means cutting into the financial freedom that the upper class has earned and giving it to the middle class, even though middle class citizens haven't rightfully \"earned\" it due to not contributing as much to society. Since socialized medicine would likely take the most from the upper class of any of the classes, this could put a sizable dent in that class' financial freedom. The lower class are the people who would benefit the most from socialized medicine. The problem here is that these are the unskilled laborers and people who are either unemployed (i.e. contributing nothing to society) or employed in jobs that anyone in society could do. These people are thought to contribute little to nothing to society on their own. They are paid meager wages because we recognize that they are contributing *something* if they're working, but the wages are so low that, ideally, they are only enough to pay for basic necessities-- food, clothing, housing, and the like. This is the way a capitalist thinker would want it; a capitalist doesn\u2019t *want* those people to have a lot of financial freedom, not because the thinker has something against those people, but because their output to society would be disproportionate from what they get in return. If everybody in the lower class had an adequate amount of financial freedom, there wouldn\u2019t be much of an impetus to climb up the professional ladder and get a job that contributes more to society. Smart people would be content taking jobs that require less work and less responsibility because their financial freedoms would still be guaranteed; a capitalist wants those people to have a desire to fill their highest sensible roles in society, not stay down in the lower class. But more than that, in a society with socialized medicine, the **middle class** would bear a large portion of the cost for the healthcare of the lower class. While the upper class might be able to take a financial hit because their financial freedoms would remain guaranteed, the middle class, which was already making sacrifices just to live comfortably, will now have to make MORE sacrifices. They will be paying higher taxes to support the healthcare of the lower class, so while their healthcare will now also be free, it would be offset by the fact that they\u2019re now paying for other people\u2019s healthcare, plus the increased systemic costs that are though to be part and parcel of a socialized medical system; this means more people in the middle class will now effectively be in the lower class. The middle class does not want this. This all circles back around to capitalism because you\u2019ve now got an economic imbalance. Healthcare is a big deal, and if the lower class has it, that means they are getting something they haven\u2019t really earned in society. The capitalist ideal is that each citizen is afforded freedom equal to that which he contributes to the nation. Thus, socialized medicine becomes wrong from an economic standpoint, and can cause many economic imbalances. This differs from things like farm subsidies, welfare programs, etc. in the eyes of many because those programs are designed to correct existing economic imbalances (and just provide basic things to people like food and shelter) rather than giving people a clear leg up like healthcare would (the notion is that if someone REALLY needs healthcare, an ER won\u2019t turn them away, so socialized medicine would only be used for non-essential procedures, even if they are greatly life-improving). Sorry for the length, but I hope this helps; this is essentially the conservative economic mindset in the U.S. and can be applied to other things as well like illegal immigration and tort reform."}]}

Evolution doesn't select for what is best for *the individual*. Traits that help the individual don't necessarily survive. Only traits that ensure *procreation* survive. The quality of life is no concern to nature. Think of pain. There's absolutely no sense of us feeling excruciating pain. When you're dying, its about as much help to you as a sheep with meter long hair. Pain itself however is very useful during lifetime to avoid injury. An individual capable of feeling pain is much more likely to procreate than an individual which is not. That said, it is very unlikely for an expensive trait like growing massive amounts of wool to occur in wild sheep. However, given the right circumstances, it could well occur. Provided it doesn't hamper reproduction too much."}]}

The only exception I've noticed are fire and/or sideshow trick performers; most of which have quite a few circus skills, but not necessarily an athletic background otherwise. Though in the former two examples, I can't recall anyone (that's stuck around long) who had no athletic background whatsoever. I'm sure a gymnast could fairly easily convert to circus arts and vice versa, but obviously the skill sets are different and take time to learn the nuances of. Certain things are even reversed; hand positioning for uneven bars and trapeze, for example, are typically opposite. Actually, an issue a gymnast might have transitioning to circus arts is the pain involved. I don't recall much pain in gymnastics, whereas with something like aerial silks or lyra, there's typically a fair amount pain involved."}]}
{"id": "4cglhs", "input": "why aren't we all thanking President Obama for lower gas prices when we all blamed Bush for higher prices?", "output": [{"answer": "The primary reason is because gas prices are low in spite of President Obama's efforts. When Obama was running for his first term, he claimed he wanted the price of fossil fuels to \"necessarily skyrocket\" which would make green energy a more viable alternative. This is somewhat silly as green technology simply isn't there yet, high gas and oil prices would disproportionately impact the poor and significant reductions in emissions could be attained by reducing coal use and switching to other fossil fuel sources sources for our energy grid. In pursuit of this, Obama prevented drilling on federal lands, significantly hampering oil production. He successfully fought the Keystone pipeline, railed against fracking and pursued energy policies designed to limit the availability of fossil fuels and drive up the cost of using them, which states are currently fighting in federal court. Beyond climate change, Obama defended these efforts by claiming none of our attempts to increase our fossil fuel supply would have any effect on reducing prices. Not only was he wrong, but recently he has tried to take credit for the fall in prices. There is always more to the story than this. OPEC decided not to ramp down production to keep the price of oil stable partially because they wanted to undercut American fracking and maintain their own market share. But the fact is, Obama had nothing to do with our current low prices and actively tried to thwart them."}]}
{"id": "1jl4bh", "input": "Why do the vast majority of humans only eat herbivores and shy away from carnivores if/when they eat meat?", "output": [{"answer": "It boils down to the cost of domesticated animals. In a very general ways, the rule of thumb is that it take 10 lbs of grains to produce 1 lb of meat in a herbivore. So there is a significant investment of resources in producing the meat we eat (which is why eating meat is rare except for the upper classes, historically). Imagine if then you then had to then take the meat that you raised on grains (the herbivores) to feed another animal. You're adding a whole layer of costs. So if it takes 10lbs of meat feed to an animal to make another 1 lb of meat on the carnivorous end-product, you're making 1 lb of carnivore meat cost 100 lbs of grain. This is economically unsustainable in terms of domesticated production. A few caveats: Pigs are omnivorous. We do eat some carnivores (like alligators) but only if there is another use of them (in the case of alligators, again, the skin is very valuable) or if we hunt them. Also, carnivores haven't been domesticated for the purpose of eating, whereas chicken, cows, pigs, etc have been breed over countless generations to make their meat tasty."}]}

HOWEVER, if there's enough ice crystals, all turning to steam at once...this actually generates propulsion (from a lot of steam trying to escape the oil at once) and can propel your turkey out of the fryer like a cannonball.

Over a day or less and I hurt quite a bit. 40f change during the day REALLY hurts Matter expands and contracts. Change over time of that is directly related to the type of material, mostly density. Different materials or materials of the same matter but different densities expand/contract at different rates over the same time. At the end, they will have expanded/contracted different amounts. Atmospheric pressure along with temperature both affect expansion and contraction. Healing of injuries involves the human body replacing or adding new material to the injured area. Typically, it is also more durable than what it replaced. To be that way, it has to be more dense then the material around it. Put the two concepts together. Just like with two different metals being affected by temp and/or pressure, they will expand/contract at different rates. This causes friction and pressure with metals, woods, etc. I suspect it also does the same with bone and flesh. Difference is, there are also nerves involved and those are stimulated by the differences.

It's really damn fast, and we're getting close to the point where the speed of light is a problem- the electrical signal literally would not be able to travel fast enough through the processor for the calculation to finish by the time the clock ticks again if we tried speeding it up much more. In addition, increasing the clock speed increases the power consumption which increases the amount of heat generated and without using liquid cooling, we can only dissipate the heat so quickly. If the processor gets too hot, it gets damaged. So raising the clock speed is pretty much out of the question. So chip manufacturers have had to focus on other ways to get more speed out of the processors, by making improvements in the design and by adding more cores so the processor can do more things at once."}]}

Plus, all parts included, they come directly shipped from the factory. Now, think that this facility is selling out of the box helis. lIterally, put the battery in, and go. Now, thinking ahead, what is your mission as a business owner? - make enough money to pay all your employees. - make a living wage - make a profit. Now, lets see. The whole helicopter costs 490 bucks, for a resale value of 500 bucks. So, per unit sold, you get a measly 10 bucks in profit, and you are prone to not often sell units. After all, they are shit quality, but with enough care, these last you for allmost forever. But what is this? This thing needs batteries, which are not included by the company, and a remote, which is also not included, and so forth? Now, lets assume you have acess to high class batteries, medium class batteries, and low class batteries. If the battery life is too long, the customer will rarely get back to you to buy new ones, but you sell top quality. If it is too short, the customer will come back all the time, but you will have a reputation for shit quality. The shit ones cost you a buck for 12, the medium ones cost 12 nucks a piece, and the top of the line ones cost 30 bucks a piece. BUT, and this is where it gets interesting, you have found a third way. Assume you found out, just reccently, that you can sell low quality batteries, heck, shit quality batteries, scratch that, you can literally stuff diodes with a potato in the battery slot, and the thing will work. Hell, they are so cheap, you can give them away for free, in a sort of \"casual\" starter pack. But with that, you guarantee that the customer will come back, and at least want a battery that will work longer then 15 minutes. So, you market these as enthusiast batteries. And of course, they are what you actually make your money with. Because you can guarantee, that every schlub under the sun will want to be an enthusiast, even if he is still a bit ashamed of having spent 500 bucks on a modell helicopter that he does not need, he will invest the extra 50 bucks for the enthusiast batteries. So, you sell those as well. And then, for the really really demented people, that spend way too much time on their helicopters, you have the \"Glorious master race \" batteries, that actually work pretty well, but because so many of them want those, you can charge an arm and a leg for them. So, most peiople will stick with enthusiast batteries, that work perfectly fine for the guy who wants to fly his heli every now and then, Only some schlubs will stick wioth the casual batteries, and get sneered at by the owners of the \"Glorious\" batteries, because those filthy casuals understand jack shit about helicopters. Never mind that every single one of these guys just gave you 500 bucks for a piece of shit modell helicopter that you imported from taiwan, and that noone really needs. And just as you thought the market clamped down, and calmed a bit, you discover that your main business area is not kids that cry to their parents to buy them a modell helicopter, but adults who buy these for yourself. Which means, you can jack up the prices some more, and when you discover that there is a magazine called \"Modding your modell helicopter\", by the Glorious battery fanclub, you allmost cum in your pants, because hol\u00f6y heck, you are overcharging some overgrown children for batteries that yoiu get for pennies on the dollar? So, you introduce several different varieties of batteries, give your staff exotic battery types, and make them swear up and down that this or that battery is better. And of course, since you do want to appear legit, you offer a service where you mod the helis for their owners, so they can literally put their battery in and fly. Because, lets face it, if they would do it themselves, you would make less money off of them, and everything you do, you can charge your rates for. And shocked, you discover that the adult children do not realize the only thing it has to do is fly the fecking heli, and they find data that supports your claims, because they do not want to look stupid for spending that much on a toy for 5 year olds. OOh, and how thy will go all out on \"filthy drone pilots\" That could never understand the peculiarities of actually choosing a battery for their heli, and that are too dumb to do so (Despite you having helped them build 90 % of their Helis. ), but the drone pilots on the other side will claim that nobody needs 60 screw on parts per units, and some people just want to start their fly thingie and go.

Hollywood movies aside, you'd have to be both murderous AND cunning on a level that would simply be too rare of a \"sweet spot\" for presidential assassination. First, you'd have to have an actual motive. And that's seriously long term. The president you wanted to kill is long out of office by the time you get to that level. Terrorists from other countries just wouldn't make it because of the culture shock, the background checks, and so on. Okay, suppose you're a psychotic from Oklahoma that decided at age 8 that you'd kill any president, no matter what their political affiliation. Just \"a president\" would do. Somehow, you have to be sane enough to pass some serious psychological exams and tests just to get into the secret service. And be very athletically fit. Now, you'd hang around a lot of these guys on your off hours, and I would imagine to get into the \"inner circle,\" you'd have to be socially aware enough not to give someone who might be your future supporters the heebie-jeebies. I am sure there are a lot of people who don't get promoted because their never get recommended. *\"Yeah, Jim Smith is a great bodyguard. Really dedicated, and very fit. Perfect record.

Not sure if I want him next to the football, if you get my drift.\"* And as another poster here suggested, the second a gun is pulled out without reason, the others would be on you like a hobo on a ham sandwich. Seeing these guys in action, in less than 2 seconds, both you and the president would be under piles of people. Then within 5- 10 seconds, the president would be in an armored car and speeding away. The conditions would have to be *just right* to pull this off, and I think the chances are far too remote with \"easier options\" being too tempting for a would be killer."}]}

Why hasn't a law been put into place preventing this?", "output": [{"answer": "As others have said, its because there are 1000 Bytes in a kilobyte. However, the history of why your operating system^1 lies to you is a rather interesting to me. So back in the day, computer makers basically decided that ~~they hated the SI system~~ it was easier to talk about cache lines in memory, amount of data moved in an operation and so on, if the units were a power of 2, because all these things tended to be in powers of two. Hence them using Kilo = 1024 = 2^10 But that's not true of everyone. Harddrive makers in particular, due to the way harddrives are made, aren't limited to powers of two^2 . Hence, there's no convinience gained from having a power of two, so here, kilo = 1000. So when you buy a harddrive, and it says its 1TB = 1000 GB = 1 million MB = 1 billion kB = 1 trillion bytes, its doing what its always done. Telling the truth. So don't get angry with your harddrive maker - they are legit. Instead, get angry with the makers of your OS, who took something which was already well defined, and instead of coming up with a new unit just crapped all over the existing definition. Because hey, screw standards, right? ^1 : Apparantly OSX gets this right. That's pretty neat. ^2 : The first magnetic harddrive, the 350 RAMAC stored 5 million 6 bit characters.

They don't generate as much noise, they are mechanically very simple and therefore very reliable, they have a higher primary efficiency (more engine power for the fuel used), and they are very compact, causing less drag. All this makes them ideally suited for passenger traffic: They are efficient at high altitude and speed, and they cause less issues with residents close to airports. Turboprops lose out on all these points. They are larger and heavier, have more moving parts, are noisy, and have lower primary efficiency. For an aircraft designed to land and take off in civilian areas, travel at high speed and cruising altitude, and to have low operating costs, turbofans are simply better. However, they have one huge advantage: They have more thrust relative to engine power. Jet aircraft are terribly inefficient when they are not flying at cruising altitude, particularly during take-off. A turboprop with equal power might not reach the same altitude and cruising speed, but it will need a shorter runway and less fuel to take off, and is far more efficient when flying at low altitude and speed. This is a big advantage for military transport planes, as well as for short range passenger aircraft."}]}

Pulse oximetry does indeed measure blood oxygen concentration by measuring absorption of specific wavelengths of light. However, it is important to note that these devices actually measure the bound hemoglobin (Hb) inside red blood cells. This is typically fine, however CO (carbon monoxide) binds to Hb thousands of times more strongly than O2 (oxygen). For this reason people rescued from fires, and fire fighters working a blaze need their O2 testing preformed with special pulse oximeters that use an additional light source to detect CO bound Hb and subtract it from the percent of O2 bound Hb, in order to obtain the correct percentage of Oxygen in the blood. Also of note is that since this is a percentage, it only determines relative O2 bound Hb, not absolute values. If you were anemic (or hypovolemic) with 100% O2 binding, you still might not be meeting your bodies oxygen demands."}]}

We have created a feedback loop of its okay, but its not okay. Its okay to want sex, but its not okay to talk about it. Its okay to admit you should want sex, but actually saying that out loud will make me think differently about you. Of course you are a healthy individual for liking sex, but you should feel just a little bit ashamed about it. That subtext is always present in every situation and no matter how openly we embrace our sexuality in open, we will always be considered a fringe minority, of deviants. Out there to get kinky and lustful in all the most unabashedly immoral, carnal ways possible. Waiting for their next sexual gratification.

Forgive me for not pretending you are five. Let's say you are a billionaire. You have a billion dollars. You don't keep it all in cash under your mattress. In fact, you don't keep it in a savings account at a bank, either, at least not very much of it. Most of your billion dollars is actually something you own which is worth a billion dollars. Property, stock, mutual funds, etc. The way taxes work in the US, you don't pay taxes on what you own. You pay taxes on your income. That income could be from salary, or from a profitable investment. But investments are special, because there is no income until you sell them for more money than you initially paid for them. So let's say you own a billion dollars worth of mutual funds. Over the course of the year, it grows 8% in value. That is an 80 million dollar increase in value. But unless you sell some of it, there is no income, so there is no tax. You are 80 million dollars richer, but you have paid no taxes. Now, hang on a second. You do need some money to live on. Let's say a million dollars this year - that should be enough. So you sell a million dollars worth of this mutual fund you own. You will have to pay taxes on this. But not on a million dollars, just on the difference between what you paid for it and what you sold it for. Let's say the difference is 20% since you initially bought it a few years ago. You will pay taxes on $200k. Also, because this is a special kind of income called capital gains, you will pay a lower tax rate than if it were your salary. Instead of 30% or more, you will pay 20%. $40k. So, you are 80 million dollars richer this year. Your tax bill is $40 thousand dollars. Your effective tax rate was one twentieth of one percent. 0.05% Not 5%, not 0.5%. 0.05%. Edit: Fixed my math."}]}

Same with sound and feel and smell, etc. When it comes to physics, you're dealing with very small things that you can't directly sense, but the idea still applies. In order to know that a particle is over there, you have to interact with it first. So you bombard it with a bunch of particles and this tells you with that particle was.

It isn't the act of a human observing, it's \"anything observing\". That is...anything being affected by the phenomenon at all. Physics cares *nothing* about humans. The fact that there are neurons firing relatively nearby makes absolutely no difference to how a particle acts. There is no link between physics and human consciousness.

{"id": "4nr0td", "input": "Why do we usually see meteors fall to Earth at an angle, but rarely straight down?", "output": [{"answer": "Because everything in space (with mass) has a relative orbit and gravitational force. In fact, you even have a gravitational force. As the distance to a planet or star gets smaller, its gravitational pull gets stronger. Since the meteor already has a velocity vector (a magnitude and direction) it begins to accelerate towards the planet and it changes direction. So the meteor is still flying in its original direction and speed but now it's being pulled in another direction with additional speed. There are no fixed points in space so an object can't fly directly to a point. Every time it passes anything in space with mass it will move slightly towards it, depending on how much mass the meteor has and how much mass the object has. Imagine you're driving down a straight road doing 75 mph and ahead of you on the side of the road is a powerful magnet. As you get closer to passing the magnet, it's going to pull you towards it. So imagine that when you combine the speed and direction that you're already going with now a force pulling you sideways, you will tend to move you at an angle between the two. Much like how a meteor will enter the earth. Of course an object in space wouldn't have traction or frictional forces of the road but hopefully that helps makes sense of it."}]}

With more people insured, shouldn't the costs go down?", "output": [{"answer": "Consider this: * While for many of us we are paying a larger portion of our medical coverage, at its peak 66.8% of the non-elderly population received a significant amount of healthcare paid for by their employer. So there is no accountability between the patient and the healthcare provider for how the third-party insurers are being charged or what how accurately what is being billed. * Overbilling cost shifting: According to  URL_0  article [*The Precarious Pricing System For Hospital Services*]( URL_1 ):  > The steady tightening of Medicare payments in the late 1980s, as well as low reimbursement levels from state Medicaid programs, imposed financial pressures on hospitals, particularly those with a high proportion of public patients. Hospitals attempted to maintain their profit margins by increasing prices faster than costs to privately insured patients, a practice known as cost shifting. The gap between private payments and costs grew from about 15 percent in the early 1980s to 31.8 percent in 1992 (Exhibit 1\u21d3).  > As private third-party payers consolidated in the early 1990s and their market clout grew, they moved away from negotiating with hospitals based on charges and toward contracts based on lower fee schedules or negotiated rates. Accordingly, billed charges defined prices for a shrinking proportion of patients. Hospitals responded by marking up billed charges even faster than the costs of care for such patients. This scenario resulted in an increasing gap between billed charges and the prices paid by most payers. This differential is reflected in Exhibit 2\u21d3, which shows the trend in the difference between gross revenues (billed charges \u00d7 patient services) and net revenues (actual payments \u00d7 patient services). This gap has grown steadily since the early 1980s and has accelerated in recent years. * The unintended consequences of Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) contracts enabled fraudulent and inflated billing. According to the J.P. Farley Corporation article [*PPO Contracts Enable Fraudulent Billing Will Result in Their Demise*]( URL_2 ) :  > The theory behind a PPO is that providers give up a discount in exchange for more business. However, a plan will not utilize a PPO that does not cover most or all providers out of fear of disrupting patients existing relationships with providers. PPOs have responded to that desire of the plan by signing up just about all providers. If all providers are covered, signing up with a PPO gives no more business to a provider. The publicly advertised and promoted advantage to the provider to sign up has been removed. In order to make up for the loss of the advertised advantage, the PPOs have included the provision that bills may not be reviewed. We know this is true because we have been involved in more than one dispute with a provider over the right to review a bill that was obviously incorrect. Providers rely on this right granted by the PPO. * Then you have the trend of hospital chains buying doctor practices according to The Blaze article [*This Emerging Trend in Medicine Threatens to Drive Up Costs to Patients*]( URL_3 ) Doctors wanting to relieve themselves of running the practice in order to get back to doing medicine. Its a win-win-win for doctors in that they no longer have to run the business, they capture the equity of their practice and get a big salary as well. The down side is that patients will carry the burden of paying for that."}]}

Imagine there are 10 people in your kindergarten class (5 boys and 5 girls) and the teacher gives out fancy colored pencils as rewards for doing extra assignments. Out of the 5 girls, there is one girl, Suzy, that really really loves those pencils so she works really hard to earn them. By the end of the year, she has earned the most out of the whole class with 20 pencils. But the rest of the girls tend to be more interested in playing with their toys, and the other children and they all each only earn 5 pencils throughout the year. So in total, all of the girls earned 40 pencils combined, or an average of 8 pencils per girl. Now, looking at the boys, there are two boys, Johnny and Billy, that really like the pencils because the teacher has some cool super hero ones this year so they work hard to get as many as they can. Johnny gets 18 and Billy gets 17. Then the rest of the boys were more interested in playing with toys and the other children so they each only earn 5 pencils. So for the boys, all together they earned 50 pencils, or an average of 10 pencils per boy. And that is how the \"women make 70 cents on the dollar compared to men\" statistic was calculated. Industrious little Suzy didn't work really hard and only earn 8 pencils, she got what she worked for and earned the most out of the whole class, just like Johnny and Billy worked hard and were rewarded for that hard work. It just so happens that in this particular kindergarten class, there were more girls who were uninterested in earning pencils than there were boys. So the average is due to the choices made by group in general, not because the teacher favored the boys and made the girls work harder for each pencil. Applying this to the real world, there are obviously really successful women like Suzy who earn what they deserve for the work they are doing just the same as men. But even today, women are much more likely to make the choice to stay home with children, work part time to focus on family, go into fields which are maybe more \"emotionally fulfilling\" but pay less, while men tend to stay in the work force longer, work full time even when starting a family, and go into careers that may be less \"emotionally fulfilling\" but have a higher salary. **tl;dr:** Add up every dollar a woman earned in the US, then add up every dollar a man earned. The women's sum will be less than the men's sum, but that's because less women work and work in high paying positions, not because of sexism."}]}

For instance, you have ring species where geographically remote members of the species cannot interbreed, but some other member 'in the middle' can breed with both. How many species is that? 3? 2? 1? You've got an entire kingdom that reproduces asexually. So they don't even have sex and breed. How many species is that, 1? Eleventy bajillion? You've got animals we already consider separate species, that can breed together. Oops?! The main thing to bear in mind is that the differences between humans are very minor. Skin color?

A white man from Portugal and a white man from Siberia may have more genetic differences between them, than a white man and a black man.

The ones that eat survive, the ones that survive reproduce, the ones that reproduce pass on their genetics into the future. Where it sits right now we are slaves to our current brain chemistry which tells us fatty, rich, high caloric foods are what is most desirable to us because the more calories we take in, the more fat reserves we can store letting us live longer until we find our next meal. Because of agriculture we stopped our hunting gathering ways staying put in a single place letting us build large societies, much larger then any band of forging nomads would be able to sustain without things like crops. This all happened so fast in terms of world history, that what was best for us has now tipped in the exact opposite end of the scale and our diets are now killing us in terms of obesity, heart and liver disease and various other autoimmunities tied to diets too high in calories, sugar, and bad fats like trans fats. We are victims of our own outrageous success at survival. Now, one could speculate that if we don't blow ourselves up first, ruin the earth with global warming, overfish the oceans, or run out of the means to produce fresh drinking water along with a myriad of huge unforeseen obstacles we will most undoubtedly face that maybe in a million years people who aren't able to control themselves and binge on junk food until they develop life threatening diseases will suffer from drastically shorter life spans.

By contrast, molesting children is usually done because the person is a pedophile, and that's a trait that they have that will never go away. They'll always have the urge to have sex with children, even after serving their time. From [this article]( URL_1 ):  > Mullane said she was able to determine that 988 convicted murderers were released from prisons in California over a 20 year period. Out of those 988, she said 1 percent were arrested for new crimes, and 10 percent were arrested for violating parole. She found **none of the 988 were rearrested for murder, and none went back to prison over the 20 year period she examined**. And from [this other article]( URL_0 ):  > The 15-year recidivism rate is 13 percent for incest perpetrators, 24 percent for rapists, and 35 percent for child molesters of boy victims. Whether or not it's *right* to have a perpetual punishment (e.g. being permanently put on a list) is a conversation for a different subreddit, but the above is why it happens."}]}
{"id": "6okvnt", "input": "How do bugs in games occur?", "output": [{"answer": "Bugs aren't things going wrong. They're what happens when the computer executes the code perfectly, but the programmer overlooked some type of interaction or edge case. The code behaves exactly as it is written, and the end user sees things that don't match their expectations because the way the user interprets the rules and the way the programmer wrote them are not a perfect match. When simulating physics interactions, bugs often stem from the digital nature of computers; movement is not calculated continuously, but rather in ticks. Say you have 2 objects moving on intersecting paths that will cause a collision between them. But one of the objects is moving extraordinarily fast, so its position changes by large increments with each tick. The distance it covers may be enough for it to completely bypass the collision point with no impact whatsoever, simply because the limited tick rate was not high enough to cover the point where the intersection should have occurred. Of course, checks can be put in to counteract this. Each tick could check if the paths intersect, calculate the point in time where one of the objects is at the intersection point, and check if the other object overlaps with that point at that same time. But the presents some of its own problems, and increases the complexity of the calculations for each tick, especially when you consider that there may be hundreds or thousands of these objects, all of which might interact with any or all of the others. TL;DR coding gets complicated very quickly."}]}

As for lefties, I can say for sure that there are a number of reasons. First and foremost, when we learn to write as children we are all taught the right-handed method of writing, which works fine for righties because it involves dragging the pen/pencil over the paper, but doesn't work for lefties because we have to push the pen/pencil over the paper instead. Most of us never learn any other way to write and so out handwriting is pretty awful as a result. Consider that in combination with the vast majority of desks in classes and such are all oriented automatically to the right for righties, which makes lefties have to reach all the way across our bodies to be able to write on them. Oh, and because we are pushing the writing utensils across the paper rather than pulling them we also have to deal with the side of our hands dragging across whatever it is we just wrote out, smudging it a lot. Just look at the heel of any lefties hand after hand writing an essay, you'll see what I'm talking about. Hope that helps!"}]}

Places on the Equator get a ton more solar radiation year round, while places on higher/lower latitudes get lower/higher during winter/summer respectively. Radiation, in this respect, is simply solar energy. Sunlight. Oceanic currents and air circulation (e.g. mid-latitude jet stream) help move around the radiation from places of constantly high radiation to places with alternating radiation. This is where your question comes in: Much of Russia (and other continental areas like the Prairies, the Steppes, etc) is incredibly far inland. This means that it is hit with intense seasonality, unlike places like Vancouver or Anchorage. Yes, Anchorage gets cold but it does not get nearly as cold as places like Tomsk in Siberia. This is all due to the proximity of the sea. That's the simple answer: Inland Russia is incredibly far from the sea."}]}

In the ancient times, due to whatever influences, base-60 systems were used because of their high divisibility, and although exact origin of 360 degree system is unknown, it's obviously related to the high number of prime factors it has. If you divide circle in three equal sectors, that's 120 degrees. If you divide it into 12 equal sectors, each of them are 30 degrees. If you divide them into 15 equal sectors, each of them are are 24 degrees. Half turn is 180 degrees. You get the point. Those times, base-10 was not really that universal. Base-10 really only become as dominant as we know it after 7th century when Indians came up with our Indian-Arabic number system. Clocks and circle division and stuff like that pre-date that by roughly thousand years or so. These systems have so much history, that despite the French trying to \"fix\" everything to use decimal, base-10 system during the French revolution, it really didn't go all that smoothly for all things. But yeah, nobody knows for sure, but the real obsession with having everything be base-10 only started at around 7th century(and while indian-arabic numerals were massively successful, it still took time for them to spread during pre-industrial times), before that we didn't really have numbers in the same sense that we have them, and things that don't use base-10 tend to pre-date that by a lot. Something between 100 BCE and 2000 BCE. Mathematicians actually don't use 360 degrees. They actually use 2 pi as the angle of circle, these units are called Radians(so 180 degrees = 1 pi radians).

The first statute is the double jeopardy. When a defendant is found not guilty, they cannot be tried again the same crime. The second one is that the jury cannot be punished for whatever decisions they choose to make. Meaning that they can choose not guilty for a defendant despite all the evidence, and the jury member will get away scot-free. The third is that a judge cannot overrule a not guilty verdict. A judge can only overrule a guilty verdict from the jury, but not the other way around.

{"id": "3289yy", "input": "Why are plays considered to be literature, but film scripts are not?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm seeing a lot of misleading answers here, so -- as someone who teaches film in an English department -- I feel like I ought to speak up. When you look at theater, the written play (the \"script\") *is* the text. It's not written for one specific production, but rather it exists and may continue as the basis for multiple productions. When someone puts on a new production of Hamlet or Death of a Salesman, they go back to the same original script by Shakespeare or Miller and perform a new rendition of that same written work. Sure, every stage director may take some creative liberties, but rarely does one perform Hamlet and hire a new playwright to write an entirely new version of Hamlet. And when we refer to \"Hamlet\" as a historical piece of culture, we're referring to the written work of Shakespeare, not a specific performance of it. In cinema, however, the script is more like a blueprint, written as the basis for one specific production. When Steven Soderbergh remakes Ocean's Eleven, he doesn't go back to the same script used for the 1960 film (as we would with Hamlet on stage), but rather Warner Bros. hires a new writer to write an entirely new script written specifically for *this* production. If, in 40 years, we get another remake of the film, the producers would hire yet another screenwriter to make yet another new script for that production. We don't hold up the original script and feel any obligation to remake that specific collection of scenes and dialogue the way we do with a play. And so, in cinema, the film itself is the \"text\" that continues through the years. When we refer to \"Ocean's Eleven\" as a historical piece of culture, we are speaking of a specific film (we wouldn't say \"Ocean's Eleven\" to mean \"that general story that Clooney and Sinatra and various other actors have performed at various times in various ways\"). In short, when we talk about \"Hamlet\" as a cultural product, we're talking about a written text; the script is what lasts through the years. When we talk about \"Ocean's Eleven\" as a cultural product, we're talking about a specific produced film. And this is partly dictated by the nature of theater vs. cinema. There is no one performance of Hamlet (on stage) that lasts through the years; as a live performance, it doesn't have permanence. A stage performance is not a \"thing\" that we can keep. The script is what lasts over time; it's the \"thing\" that lasts. In cinema, on the other hand, the performance does last, recorded on celluloid (or a hard drive), such that the film becomes the \"thing\" that gets passed down through the years. Just like a building, we can go back and look at the original blueprints, and compare it to the final thing that was produced, but when we discuss architecture, we wouldn't hold up the blueprints for the Empire State Building as the \"thing\" in question -- we would look at the actual Empire State Building.

It's a long chain of carbons with an oxidized handle. Look at the carbohydrate (sugar) molecule. It's a shorter carbon chain of slightly oxidized carbons with yet another oxidized handle. Calories are generated when the carbons are oxidized away (burned really; they leave as CO2). Our metabolisms stop burning away when chain gets down to 2 carbons, since single carbons (methane, methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid) are too small, insoluble, and/or toxic. While this may sound like the end of the road for why ethanol packs calories, it's actually the beginning. Ethanol and Acetic Acid (Vinegar) are converted into Acetaldehyde and finally acetyl-CoA, *the* precursor to most larger \"energy storage\" molecules. Our metabolisms get around the 2 carbon oxidation limit merely by building a larger chain out of the acetyl-CoA and then digesting them as described earlier. As a matter of fact all of the regulatory mechanisms meant to conserve or burn calories occur before those carbons would become acetyl-CoA. As a result our metabolisms have no choice but to use the carbons from Ethanol before metabolizing any other carbon sources.

{"id": "2edyj6", "input": "why do certain countries, such as the United States, seem to always be at war with someone? How have some countries managed to stay relatively peaceful? (Ex. Switzerland)", "output": [{"answer": "Late to respond, so this will probably get buried, but none of the top answers really address the question... The modern \"Superpower\" is really a post-WWII phenomenon. To grossly over-simplify thousands of years and millions of pages of world history... In the wake of WWII, there were \"three worlds\": - **The First World** was USA, Western Europe, and countries affiliated/conquered/surrendered (Japan, especially). These countries were nominally capitalist-ish, recognizing individual freedoms and property rights within mostly-democratic government structures. The USA was instrumental in the reconstruction and development of many of these war-devastated countries, and had tremendous influence, often providing or overseeing the primary or only substantive military force. - **The Second World** was USSR, Eastern Europe, and (to a lesser degree) China, plus affiliated countries/alliances. This alliance nominally gave primacy to the welfare of the \"state\" or collective, over individuals and property rights. Different from the alliances and diplomatic influence of the USA, USSR offered/imposed/pursued direct military and political control over member states, with an ideology that pursued an eventual worldwide state of communism or hardline socialism, more totalitarian than \"democratic\". - **The Third World** was a collective term for all countries not specifically affiliated with either the USA or the USSR. Contrary to popular belief, it does not specifically mean \"poor\", it just means outside of American or Russian influence. Theoretically, this could include Switzerland, for example, but nobody really counted it that way. \"Third World\" became increasingly a descriptor for really a number of different \"worlds\" with their own histories and geo-politics, including Islamic states, the Indian sub-continent, and much of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia. Almost immediately after WWII, a so-called **\"Cold War\"** began, between the first and second worlds (USA and USSR), over geopolitical and military control/influence, especially in the \"third world\". Depending on how you look at it, the USA/\"first world\" spent much of the mid-late 20th century either \"protecting\" unaffiliated countries from Soviet takeover, or else preventing the people of slave-state, capitalist-run \"Banana Republics\" from joining the worldwide socialist collective. - This conflict of ideologies and military/political power was perhaps no more vivid than in the **Vietnam War**, where the Americans \"lost\", but it is very hard to say who \"won\". Somewhere around a million Vietnamese died before American withdrawal, but it is very hard to see how Vietnam benefitted from the Soviet Liberation, or how they would have been better had the Americans \"won\". - The **Vietnam War** also vividly illustrated the human cost of the \"cold war\" to Americans and the First World. A common takeaway lesson is that the people of Vietnam are worse off, after the war, but would not have been much better off, had the Americans won. I.e., it was lose-lose for Vietnam. For the next 20 years or so, this \"keep the cold war cold\" mentality led to some ugly and complex interventions on all sides, often led by intelligence agencies rather than military intervention, where American and Soviet governments engaged in all kinds of morally-dubious behavior. **Fast-forward to 2000**: The Soviet Union has collapsed. The \"second world\" is not even really a thing. Opposition to American/Western geopolitical hegemony, is now fragmented and often somewhat nuanced: no serious contender is advocating a worldwide socialist state, or anything like it. There are all kinds of terribly-run countries in the world, but most of them are either obviously corrupt, or run in the service of strongman-type leaders who use the country to enrich themselves. The biggest real, global, ideological alternative to western-style democracy is a loose and disorganized association of **Islamists**. - **\"Islamist\" can be different from \"Muslim\", or \"Islamic.\"** The USA and \"first world\" generally became the face of whatever was good or bad about global culture and circumstances, after the collapse of the USSR. Whatever benefit of the doubt has previously been extended to the \"good guys\" quickly turned to skepticism of the global hegemony of the \"people in power\". As the sole remaining military, political, cultural, and economic superpower, America and the \"First World\" came to mean something new and different in geopolitical discourse. Increasingly, it came to imply those responsible for, and who benefitted from, whatever state the world was in, at any given point in time. Islamists unhappy with the state of world affairs attacked skyscrapers in New York, not because they had any particular gripe with the people who worked there, but because they were symbolic of... something. WTC was a symbol of a new global pan-culturalism, an Americanization of the world, a multicultural homogenization... As the sole remaining superpower, USA is involved with almost any war, anywhere in the world, either directly or indirectly. Compared with most global empires in history (e.g., the Romans, Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, the British Empire, etc), the USA appears to be mostly an improvement, in a humanitarian sense. But there is also a frightening and anti-human aspect to American/western dominance: Never before in the history of the world has so much power been so concentrated. In the past, broad philosophies competed in part by combat. You could fight the people you disagreed with, if worse came to worst. But it is difficult to foresee a world where anyone, even China, could win a fight against the USA, without resorting to global thermonuclear war. Which means that the world is increasingly divided into two camps: - Those who work with and through American/first-world political and diplomatic channels, and; - Those who see an apocalyptic outcome as a tolerable or even desirable one. To the specific question: it is unrealistic to imagine a world where the sole remaining superpower is **not** involved in a high proportion of military conflicts. One might well disagree with the USA on any number of points, but who else do you call on, when genuine \"bad guys\" start taking over? The question implies that wars/conflicts should/might happen *without* American intervention. If not the Americans, then who? Or should the world just leave each other to kill each other, when the fancy strikes? It's not an easy question to answer... edit:typos and speling"}]}

Is this injustice? Some may think so, but there are very good arguments that it is not. Imagine that the status of every piece of property, everywhere in the world, could be called into question, with its current owners called up to pay for the crimes of their ancestors centuries ago. Where would it end? Could the descendants of the Romano-Celts in Britain sue the Saxons? Could the Saxons sue the Normans? Could one American Indian tribe be sued by another for something that happened before European colonization? A functioning system of property rights requires that a cutoff point be established, beyond which no appeals can be made. (The moral basis for this principle is that someone living today is not responsible to the victims of his ancestors many generations ago.) In a capitalist system, this turns out to be the best for everyone, as anyone who \"unjustly\" starts off with more than his ability would grant him, because his ancestors were conquerors, gradually sinks down to the mean level of wealth, just as the aristocrats in Europe gave way to the capitalist *nouveau riche*. Furthermore, the Indian tribes' claims to \"ownership\" of land were very often invalid, as the land was not owned by individuals, but \"collectively\", and was often not developed, but simply roamed over (however, there were exceptions, such as the Cherokees, who Westernized but were still unjustly deported).

{"id": "5g31cf", "input": "How does 'Bail' work in America? Why do they attribute money to the severity of crimes?", "output": [{"answer": "1) Bail is money you give to the court in exchange for a promise that, if you are let out of jail before trial, you will show up to your trial. Bail basically is a means of ensuring that you show up - you aren't paying the government anything, you're giving them money to hold that they return to you when your trial takes place. 2) Bail amounts depend on two things - how much money you have, and the severity of the crime you committed. If you committed some heinous crime, they may not allow you out on bail at all; you simply cannot be trusted out in the community, and/or no amount of money could ensure that you wouldn't try to run, because you might be sentenced to life in prison or death. Likewise, if you have a history of running away when facing trial, they're unlikely to allow you out on bail for any amount of money. If you have a lot of money, they're likely to ask for a greater amount of money from you for bail - to a poor person, $1,000 might be a lot, but to Donald Trump, that wouldn't be very much. However, other factors are taken into account as well - having strong ties to the local community will tend to lower bail amounts, for instance, because if you fled, you'd have to be abandoning all that stuff. Owning a house or a business makes it much less likely you'll just run off because there's no way for you to take that house or business with you. Obviously, this varies depending on the crime. The purpose of bail is ultimately to get you to show up - if they have other reasons to think you'll show up if they let you out of jail until your trial, they're less likely to ask for bail money. 3) If you fail to show up to your trial, you lose your bail money - the government keeps it. 4) In some states, such as Oregon, bail works slightly differently; instead of giving the government the full amount, you give the government 1/10th the amount of your bail. If you show up, you get that money back; if you fail to show up, not only do you lose the money the government is holding, but you owe the government the rest of that money as well, and they may seize it from you. 5) In some other states, it is possible to get a loan from someone known as a bail bondsman. Typically speaking, a bail bondsman will ask for approximately 10% of the bail as a fee; the bail bondsman then gives the government the full amount of your bail. If you show up to your trial, the bail bondsman will get their money back, but you won't get that 10% of the bail that you paid the bail bondsman back - that was their fee, so you're just out their money. This allows you to get out with 1/10th the amount of bail you would pay otherwise, but you do lose that bail for sure. This is how bail bondsmen make money. In most states where this is legal, the bail bondsman can also hire a bounty hunter to track you down if you skip out on your trial - if the bounty hunter tracks you down and brings you back in, the bail bondsman gets their bail money back, though the bail bondsman will have to pay the bounty hunter for their services (though in some cases, bail bondsmen double as bounty hunters). The practice of bail bondsmen and bounty hunters is controversial; the idea behind bail bondsmen is that, as private individuals, they'll hunt you down if you skip out on your trial. They also frequently force you to get cosigners for your bond, and if you skip out on your trial, those other people may become responsible for the loan that the bail bondsman made to you, further disincentivizing fleeing. The problem is that this can lead to corruption (bail bondsmen make money from people going to jail, which can lead to them getting cozy with local law enforcement and judges in an attempt to get more money, as well as incentivizing them to want to push for more things to be criminalized), overly high bonds being demanded of people as a matter of course (because people only have to pay 1/10th of it), bail bondsmen making money doing something that the government should be doing itself, it undercutting the idea of bonds in the first place, it primarily being directed at taking advantage of poor people, and the problems which can be caused by bounty hunters (who aren't law enforcement officers) doing illegal things, harassing people, or in some cases, kidnapping people."}]}

After the Second World War, the US found itself in a position of unprecedented opportunity; it benefited from the war economy, and it saw growth soar on the back of arms and munitions exports amongst other things. This was helped by the fact that, by contrast to the old manufacturing hubs in Europe and Asia, the US mainland was largely untouched by the physical effects of war. On the other side of the Atlantic you had the old colonial powers suffering the effects of huge social and economic disruption as Europe began the long process of rebuilding. In short, the least damaged of the victors had manoeuvred themselves into the forefront of a new world order, and it wasn't until they - that is, the US and the USSR - realised that each sought to become the new Britain, as it were, that ideology became an issue. The late 19th and early 20th Centuries had seen some conflict between Marxism and Capitalism - like the Spanish Civil War - but it now became important as a way of trying to achieve hegemony. The US recognised that 'soft-power' approaches are every bit as important as military strength when it comes to keeping yourself important on the world stage; so, to make sure that they stayed more influential than the Russians, they implemented schemes like the Marshall Plan, which injected capital into Europe to help with the rebuilding. The hallmark of American aid, though, is that it comes with strings attached; free market strings, ironically enough. Countries buying into the American way of doing things, and accepting all the various benefits that brings, were expected to toe the line in terms of establishing liberal free-market principles. So using the language of freedom and democracy, and 'otherising' the Soviets by painting them as evil centralist god-haters (as per Sen. Joe McCarthy's modus operandi), America was able to maximise its own economic and military reach in the post-war balance of power and set itself up as one of two superpowers for most of the rest of the 20th Century. Tl:dr, the world order was shaken up after WWII, America and Russia were both in a position to take advantage, and both needed an ideological framework to sell their way of doing things. It wasn't so much that America hated Communism as that America loved liberalism. The relationship was more coke and pepsi than black and white."}]}

Lobbying is a loophole to get around that nasty business of \"bribing an elected official\" being illegal. ISPs spend a ludicrous amount of money on lobbying, making the elected officials they lobby to very happy. In return these elected officials ignore you (the people who elected them) and what you want, and instead try to make the ISPs happy instead. What will make ISPs happy is being able to make your internet slower while saying \"If you pay us EVEN MORE money, we'll let you visit some sites at regular speed.\" Congress taking control of the Net Neutrality laws from the FCC would mean that these ~~elected~~ purchased officials would be able to make the laws that make their ISPs happy. Which would make you very unhappy. It is important to note that \"Fast Lanes\" is a very deceptive term. The internet will not be faster for those who pay more, the ISPs will simply throttle those who don't pay more, making the regular internet speeds we have now into the Fast Lanes."}]}

Reduced to i by mid-12c. in northern England, it began to be capitalized mid-13c. to mark it as a distinct word and avoid misreading in handwritten manuscripts. **The reason for writing I is ... the orthographic habit in the middle ages of using a 'long i' (that is, j or I) whenever the letter was isolated or formed the last letter of a group; the numeral 'one' was written j or I (and three iij, etc.), just as much as the pronoun. [Otto Jespersen, \"Growth and Structure of the English Language,\" p.233]** The form ich or ik, especially before vowels, lingered in northern England until c. 1400 and survived in southern dialects until 18c. The dot on the \"small\" letter -i- began to appear in 11c. Latin manuscripts, to distinguish the letter from the stroke of another letter (such as -m- or -n-). Originally a diacritic, it was reduced to a dot with the introduction of Roman type fonts. The letter -y- also was written with a top dot in Old English and early Middle English, when it tended to be written with a closed loop at the top and thus was almost indistinguishable from the lower-case thorn (\u00fe).

Is it for reasons other than to teach good behavior?", "output": [{"answer": "I think at this point in time it has simply become a fun cultural tradition. Yes it can be a tool to make children behave around christmas time, but most people, children included, don't really care about Santa most of the year except around christmastime. It evolved from various folklore. One in particular was a Germanic story about a troll like creature that would come down the chimney at night and eat misbehaving children. Germanic folklore was filled with many stories of this sort intended to keeo children from doing things like wandering into the forest or eating too much. This is where we get the idea that Santa comes down the chimney and delivers coal to bad children. As for the gift giving. That came from other various folklore like Saint Nick, Sinter Klaus, Father Christmas, and others from various regions of Europe like the Netherlands and England. He was a benevolent man who would give gifts to children, in some cases at christmas and in some cases just whenever he was in town. All of this folklore eventually converged into what we know as Santa Clause and became associated with Christmas. It's really just a combination of various European cultures and folklore, some intended to teach children lessons, some just to bring joy. Then it became commercialized and a staple of the Christmas tradition. We don't necessarily teach children to believe in Santa anymore than we teach them to speak our language. It's just a cultural phenomenon. It doesn't do any harm and it brings joy to children and adults enjoy telling stories about him. It's simply a fun custom."}]}

How does that workout?", "output": [{"answer": "If your fixed costs remain the same (cost of item being sold, rent, employee costs, etc.) then the 10% discount just comes out of the margin -- the amount left between the revenue and the cost to generate that revenue. Let's say you sell baseball caps for $15. You have to buy the hat from the manufacturer, rent your store pay the utilities on the store, pay your store employees, pay to run advertising and so on... let's say the wholesale cost of the hat is $10, and the rent, salaries, etc. run you another $3 per hat (averaging the month's sales vs. those monthly costs). So you have a margin of $2 per hat sold. Let's say you sell 500 hats/month, that's a total margin of $1000/mo. on $10,000 in sales. Now let's say you run a 10% off coupon that all your customers use for a month. You're still paying $10 for each hat. You're still paying the same rent, same utilities, same salaries. But you're only making $13.50 per hat now, and the margin after paying the expenses is $250. So instead of having $1000 in profits, you barely break even at the end of the month. Now you increase sales by 40%. Instead of selling 500 hats, you sell 700 hats. You have to pay the $2000 additional to your supplier for the extra 200 hats you sell, but your rent, salaries, etc. remain constant. So your effective margin is $3.50 on those 200 hats, or $700. Now, your profits are $950 ($250 + $700), or almost equal what they were before but you sold 40% more merchandise at a 10% discount."}]}

Back then, they had no idea that someday people would be able to take it home and look at their movie in such precise detail. They never planned for that, so sometimes things are a little fuzzy. For example, there might be a shot that is a bit out of focus, but it wasnt a big deal back then because no one would see it.

{"id": "8ozyln", "input": "When glancing at a clock, why does the first second after glancing at it sometimes feel longer than the rest?", "output": [{"answer": "Basically, it has to do with a phenomenon called \"saccadic masking\" where the brain selectively blocks visual processing during eye movements so that neither the motion of the eye (and subsequent motion blur of the image) nor the gap in visual perception is noticeable. You can \"observe\" this phenomenon yourself by looking at your eyes in the mirror; look back and forth from eye to eye and you'll notice that you cannot see your eyes move, even though you know they're moving and an observer would be able to clearly see your eyes moving. The process works like this: in the beginning milliseconds of your eyes moving, a signal is sent to your brain to start this process of masking and your brain starts receiving significantly reduced information from your eyes. When your eyes move to the clock, your brain also receives the message, \"hey, a little bit of time just passed there and we didn't send you any information\" so what the brain does in response is actually backwardsly fill in the period of time that you \"missed\" with what your eyes refocus on. So, when you refocus on the clock, your brain receives basically \"extra\" visual information of the clock with the second-hand at whatever time it's at which can make a second seem extra-long."}]}
{"id": "2bln8r", "input": "Why does it take longer to build muscle the longer you've been doing it and fat longer to burn off the less you have on you?", "output": [{"answer": "I look at it like this; If you put stress on your muscles, you tear muscle fibers. In order to let your muscles repair properly you need to ingest enough proteins. Now, let's look at your example; if you bench press 200 pounds, you put a lot of stress on your muscle, causing a lot of muscle fibers to tear. You need a lot of proteins in order to restore that. Now, if you go too *400* pounds, you put even more stress on your muscle, so you need to ingest *even more* to have it repaired properly. So if you feel like the amount of muscle is not what you expected it to be, it's purely because you're not eating enough proteins to repair the damaged muscle tissue. For losing fat, I have this philosophy: When you are exercising to lose weight, your goal is to *lose weight*. But realise that weight doesn't equal fat. You are made of much more than just fat. During exercise your body first uses any available energy source directly from your bloodstream, but once that's depleted, your body starts utilizing energy storages. Energy is stored in as well muscle as in fat. So your body is going to break down fat tissue *and* glycogen from your muscles at the same time. After this, you eat to restore energy. But don't overdo it, because then the workout would be for naught! Avoid saturated fatty acids and go for complex carbohydrates and proteins (to restore muscle fibers and your glycogen). This way fat will barely not be restored. Now, when you come to the low body fat percentages, another part comes to play. Fat is not just ugly, it does serve a purpose. Fat keeps you warm in the winter and provides kind of like a protective layer. Your body just genetically doesn't want to lose his nice and warm soft layer so it will *actively* store fat. Even if you only ate proteins, your body can metabolize proteins to sugar and than sugars to fat. So moral of the story; exercise is important, but **DIET IS EVERYTHING!**"}]}

Fusion of certain atoms (the small ones up to iron) gives off a lot of energy, with hydrogen giving out the most. It is what fuels our sun!

Poor people can't afford meats and vegetables, nor can they afford frequent trips to the grocerry store. When poor people shop, they are concerned with satiating hunger, getting the calories they need, saving money, making one trip, and getting foods that will last as long as possible. Fatty foods and carbs store well and are cheap, and the carbs especially pack on weight. And why do poor people buy junk food? Because being so poor, they can't afford outtings and events, a bag of chips is sometimes the only little comfort they can afford. --- As far as Prof. Haub, I would argue that diet took a lot of effort to execute - to formulate and to stay on target. And eating is not just about calories. I can exceed my calorie needs with just a couple candy bars, but that doesn't A) meet my nutritional needs and B) doesn't satiate my hunger. Most people are going to eat until they are at least satisfied, and poor people are eating cheap food to do it. Carbs. They'll blow way past their caloric needs on cheap food until they feel satiated. And not all carbs are created equal. Don't undervalue biochemistry. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides are all going to be used differently in your body. A food high in polysaccharides are going to go straight to your thighs while your body consumes smaller and easier carbohydrates.  >  Shouldn't poverty actually be incentive to lose weight then, since a person will save money by reducing the amount of food they eat? Is there something I'm missing here? You can do it on a poor person diet, but no one wants to feel hungry. And another aspect I just remembered is that shitty food can make you feel shitty. I remember a doctor talking about this. I don't remember the technical words, but digestion takes place in two different stages: you're either breaking food down, or you're absorbing and processing it. When you're busy absorbing and processing shitty food, you might feel sick; what you might instinctively learn is that if you keep eating, you're always in the break down stage, and you don't feel so bad. Shitty food trains you to keep eating."}]}
{"id": "79p563", "input": "If you put a pill under your tongue to get it in your blood stream faster, does it bypass the stomach and liver?", "output": [{"answer": "Medical student here. Certainly not a board-certified expert yet, but I can weigh in a bit on this. The benefit of taking medications sublingually (below the tongue) is that the drug enters your blood more quickly, and has a greater opportunity to exert its effects. Consider this -- when you take a pill, it needs time to pass through the stomach and be absorbed primarily through the intestines. After it's absorbed by the gut, the first place that blood goes is straight to the liver. Your body is smart, and it's configured to send the \"collecting\" blood from the gut right to the liver in case you've absorbed something bad. Some drugs are highly susceptible to this process, which is called \"first pass metabolism.\" In fact, some drugs can't be given orally at all, because having all of the dose hit the liver right after absorption ensures that they're not gonna be effective. This is why you can't take birth control with certain antibiotics (Rifampin) -- the antibiotic makes the liver more trained for destroying it and similar drugs, including birth control. Additionally, some drugs simply aren't absorbed at all by the gut, so you can't get them in that way. When you're absorbing the pill elsewhere, be it under your tongue or through an IV, it isn't all going straight to the liver. Yes, it will eventually get there, but it will do so more slowly and not at once. In the meantime, the drug can spread throughout your blood and reach other targets in the body rather than hit the brick wall that is your liver. There is a greater chance for the drug to do its job, as opposed to going \"Stomach - >  Liver - >  Gone\""}]}
{"id": "48dunx", "input": "Why are phone scammer that spoof caller ID unstoppable? Why can't telecom operators filter spoofed caller ID info the way data networks filter spoofed IP addresses?", "output": [{"answer": "Imagine a letter being sent in the mail. The destination address is like an IP address. The names printed above the addresses are like caller ID metadata. They don't affect where the letter goes, they're just extra information for whoever receives the letter. Now, if you put the wrong addresses on the letter, your letter goes to the wrong place, or the receiver can't respond because they don't know where the letter came from, or maybe they do respond, but to the wrong place. Because of this, putting the wrong addresses on a letter is not abused very often, because it doesn't achieve much. For the same reasons, spoofing IP addresses is fairly uncommon, with the fix being to block individual addresses or address ranges manually on the receiver's side. To be fair, it would be easy to implement a similar mechanism for caller ID. For instance, you could simply tell your phone to block any calls from John Smith. But then the real John Smith can't call either. Same problem occurs with IP filtering. However, putting the wrong *name* on a letter might actually achieve something. Maybe you can trick the receiver into thinking the letter came from someone it didn't. So how do you make sure a letter came from the person it said it did? Certified mail. But, it's a pain in the ass and quite expensive because of all the extra steps involved, just as it would be for phone systems. To answer the question more directly, spoofed caller ID cannot be filtered because there is no mechanism for nonrepudiation. Mostly because it's complicated and expensive (usually this would required asymmetric crypto and a certificate authority). Caller ID spoofing is not a huge problem, so it's not worth the extra effort or expense."}]}

You can't see it though, as it is usually set into the vertical shaft, or the \"tower\", and acts as a turbine. It collects air from a vented inlet usually toward the bottom of the tower, and directs it upward into the Copus ring, which then redirects the moving air into a series of tiny unidirectional holes inside the inner surface of the ring. You will notice that the fan has a sort of vacuum on the side opposing the blowing air. This is caused by moving the air at such a velocity through the tiny holes that ambient air is pulled through the Copus ring from the atmosphere. Barometric pressure plays a key role in the operation of the bladeless fan. The inside of the Copus ring is intentionally shaped like an airfoil in order to move as much air as possible. So, combine an aerodynamically sound surface with pressurized airflow, and voila! Dyson's latest money maker."}]}
{"id": "ovukh", "input": "Bra sizing???", "output": [{"answer": "You measure the circumference of your ribcage just under your breasts, then you measure around at the fullest at your breasts. Now there are two methods of calculation. One tells you to subtract the ribcage measurement from the breast measurement, the other tells you to add 2-4 inches to the ribcage measurement. This is because decades ago when stretchy materials like Lycra didn't exist, you need to add some inches to the band in order to be comfortable. So most modern day bra manufacturers (at least in the US) use the modern method. Let say your ribcage measurement is 34 and breast measurement is 38. You subtract 38-34 = 4. The ribcage measurement will be the band size (so it's 34) and every inch difference will be one cup up (if you get 1 inch difference you have A cup, 2 inch difference you have B cup. In our example the difference is 4 inches, so congratulations you have D cup boobs). Our bra size is 34D. It might be a little confusing when you get to more than 5 inches in difference. Back in the 50's the biggest cup available was D (I guess they didn't foresee breast implant become popular or people getting fatter), so when they realized they need to make even bigger cup sizes, they just add an extra D thinking boobs cannot possibly get any bigger (most old ladies at the time wore one-piece corslettes, bra was something younger and slimmer women would buy). When they needed to make yet bigger cups, some manufacturers decides to make DDD and others decides to go up one letter to E. There isn't a standard on cup sizing beyond DD so some bras cups will be A-B-C-D-DD-DDD-E while other bras cups will be A-B-C-D-DD-E-F. (I've noticed DDD is more common in the US while DD-E is more common in the UK). Take note though, finding the correct sizing is only the beginning. Bra manufacturer may or may not make the bra according to the size or make bras that's just not suitable for your shape. Therefore it's very important to try several different sizes/styles on and learn what's the best design for you."}]}

What other people have said is close, but not entirely correct. You're not using friction per se to just \"rub off\" the graphite. What is happening is actually a solubility between two nonpolar solid substances, the rubber and the graphite. So the London dispersion forces (really weak intermolecular forces) between these molecules are attracted to each other and as you rub and create heat it increases the attraction and removes more graphite from the paper as it is attracted to the rubber. That's why you get dirty rubber dust. That's also why your lead sticks to paper to begin with, those same London dispersion forces are attracting the lead to the paper. Those forces are actually a little stronger than attraction between the graphite and the rubber which is why you have to put a little energy into getting it all out. \u263a Edit: I was so excited I forgot to answer your question completely. Erasers are made out of rubber because it is a nonpolar solid material which attracts other nonpolar solids, like graphite.

Which is to say that it has a much lower cost of manufacturing for just about everything, and so due to the EU's common market/Germany's close proximity to other EU countries Germany has just come to dominate industrial production in the EU. The overwhelming majority of what Germany exports to the US are cars and industrial engines, as well as parts for both of those. The trade deficit that Germany is running with the US isn't because its exporting a lot to the US, but rather because it imports very little. Over time running a trade deficit drains wealth out of an economy, making a country poorer over time. Every dollar of a country's trade deficit needs to either come from its citizen's savings, or be financed through foreign debt. In the first case, the country immediately becomes poorer. In the latter case the country becomes poorer in the future, though how much poorer depends on the interest rate of the loans and how much inflation has occurred in the meantime. It is possible to outgrow a trade deficit. For example, the US has run a trade deficit since the 80's and nonetheless has had relatively robust growth since that time. Although the US trade deficit is draining wealth out of the country, the US' position as the main driver of innovation in the world causes it to generate enough new wealth every year to replace what is leaving through the trade deficit and grow the economy. Since 2008, every Western European country has seen negative real GDP growth (that is, their GDP growth is either equal to or less than inflation+population growth). Although this is a complex situation, the underlying cause can basically be boiled down to Germany running a large trade surplus with Western Europe while being unable to convert that trade surplus into GDP growth due to a lack of consumer spending. Basically, Germany has become stuck in a cycle wherein other EU countries buy German goods, and then Germany takes the money from those purchases and loans it back so that those countries can continue to afford to buy more German goods next year. You can see the situation in Greece circa 2010 as being the end result of that cycle when the importing country replaces its entire domestic industry with foreign goods purchased with foreign loans. That doesn't mean that Italy and France will become repeats of Greece, because those countries still do have an industrial base. But Greece is a good example of how wealth is drained out of country by this system. Nor does it mean that this situation is bad for Germany. Although Germany has seen very little growth from it so far, Germany has more than tripled the amount of foreign currency in its possession since 2004 and increased its industrial base by about 75%. *At some point* German consumers will start spending that money instead of shipping it back overseas, and when that happens they will become much wealthier. As for the US, Germany is draining about $70 billion in wealth from the US economy every year. Regardless of whether the US can replace that wealth through innovation, the US' main complaint is that the trade deficit arises largely from informal trade barriers that Germany has erected to US goods. For example, most US goods need to go through a complex and costly certification process before they can be sold in Germany. This makes it almost impossible for most small US businesses to export goods there, as they don't have the financial capacity to navigate the German bureaucracy. For large US companies, this acts as an effective tariff. The US Import/Export Banks official guidance on Germany politely sums it up as: \"While not directly discriminatory, government regulation by virtue of its complexity may offer a degree of protection to established local suppliers. Safety or environmental standards, not inherently discriminatory but sometimes zealously applied, can complicate access to the market for U.S. products. American companies interested in exporting to Germany should make sure they know which standards apply to their product and obtain timely testing and certification.\""}]}

(It's a lot more complex than this but these are the two important classes). * Volatile compounds like [diacetyl]( URL_1 ), [Hydroxymethylfurfural]( URL_2 ) etc. are released which gives caramel its characteristic smell/flavour. * The polymers (30+ carbon atoms/molecule) formed are grouped into three classes: Caramelans, Caramelens and Caramelins. They contribute to the brown colour of caramel. Clearing out some misconceptions 1. Caramelization is not the same as the Maillard reaction (browning of bread, meat etc). *The Maillard reaction requires amino acids to react with sugars, whereas caramelization does not* (it is simply the degradation of sugars with heat). They both involve browning and can occur simultaneously, on the same food base, and with similar results on the taste buds, so they are quite easily confused. 2. It is not brown because of carbon. That sort of burning requires a much higher temperature than the caramelization reaction. If you try to caramelize on too high a flame, you will see it turning black and tasting charred. That is carbon (see pyrolysis/carbonization for such reactions)."}]}

Florida is a vacation/cut loose spot for a wide variety of people (e.g. Spring Break at Daytona, Redneck Riviera in the Panhandle, cruise passengers at Fort Lauderdale, the entire shitshow known as Orlando, etc.), most categories of which have \"getting drunk\" as a high priority on the list. Guess what happens when towns are filled to three times beyond normal population with drunk people. 2. Florida has/recently had the [5th highest violent crime rate]( URL_0 ) and has a much greater population than any of the states ahead of it. (IIRC Florida just moved into the #3 spot in population behind CA and TX) This means that there is simply a lot of violent crime to report on. 3.

There isn't a lot of \"middle income\" in Florida and the cities that aren't beach resorts tend to be quite poor. (For fun, check out the Sarasota area, which features both sides of the income spectrum in close proximity - the local government in Sarasota also happens to be extremely unfriendly to homeless people). These disparities likely create a lot of tension and give a lot of ammo for the media (guess which income group they cater to) to report on what the \"white trash\" are up to. Hope this helps!

{"id": "4vvdva", "input": "Why do we begin to hallucinate after a lack of sleep or severe dehydration?", "output": [{"answer": "There are many types of hallucinations. To explain why we hallucinate during sleep deprivation, I'll refer specifically to the visual system and visual hallucinations. Sight doesn't just involve your eyes, the brain is a huge part of the process. Your eyes take in light and turn it into electrical energy. The brain organizes and interprets that energy, creating your perception of the world around you. The brain is divided into many sections, all with specific purposes. Some of those sections process simple information, features such as: size, shape, color. This is referred to as bottom-up (or data-driven) processing, as it uses the most simple and smallest pieces of information available to build a picture of what you're seeing. Other sections process more complex information, using your past experiences to make the best guess about the meaning behind that simple information. This is referred to as top-down (or stimulus-driven) processing, because your brain uses what it already knows to complete the picture. Optimally, vision is an equal combination of both bottom-up and top-down processing. In fact, most of the brain's processing can be explained using this \"dual-route\" system. Sleep deprivation impairs the brain's ability to process information. It slows thinking, impairs judgement, and increases the chance that your brain will make errors. There are many reasons as to why: in short, your body needs sleep to recover and conserve energy and your brain needs it to re-organize and consolidate information (like create memories). It also relies on something called a circadian rhythm, which regulates your alertness. Sleep loss increases the stress on your body and restricts your blood flow. Your brain receives less blood, slowing it down, and the overall stress on your system reduces alertness, making it more difficult for your brain to focus its attention. Hallucinations are thought of as visual misperceptions, or errors in processing. Why do they happen? We don't *really* know. But based on what we do know, we can make some guesses. Either the brain is over-relying on bottom-up information at the expense of top-down correction, or the top-down system is making guesses by \"filling in the blanks\" about bottom-up information that isn't there. The result is a misperception, which is simply put, an error in processing. While sleep deprived, you're more prone to making these errors."}]}

Those who seem more apathetic generally fall into a category of either not understanding what rape can do to a person, or feel as if things that don't affect them aren't worth their time. In large part the response to rape on the internet derives from the approach often taken in the real world which is one of either willfully ignoring it because of the unpleasantness involved, or of blaming the victim either because A: They are the only person involved that can be contacted. If the act itself is what is so terrible, and you want to condemn the act but only have access to the one person who was involved then victim blaming sort of makes sense to some people. B: Selfishness, entitlement, and a lack of empathy lead people to believe that wearing clothes of a revealing nature puts those around around the victim into such an unfair and teasing situation that the rapist was justified. C: The responder has had similar feelings, fantasies, or desires and justifying someone else acting on those desires is a good way to rationalize having similar thoughts.

What is this privilege I keep hearing about?", "output": [{"answer": "White privilege is much more subtle than that. To quote /u/effbuc:  >  White privilege only means you are **more likely** to succeed. It doesn't mean you are guaranteed more pay or lavish benefits. It's a hundred small things throughout the course of one's life that demonstrate your privilege, or indeed lack thereof. Take me for example. I'm white, male and middle class (and British). At the age of 11, I took the 11+ and got into a selective school. I was able to pass the it because my parents paid for a tutor for me and even tutored me themselves specifically so I could pass this test. Going to a grammar school (as they're known) means that I have had access to a great many opportunities I would not have otherwise had. I have had teachers who throughout my education thus far have looked at me and *subconsciously* gone, \"there is a white boy: he will be good at my subject, he will be a good worker\" and so on and so forth. I have been taught well and not been allowed to fall behind without comment and action to prevent me from slipping. I have had access to maths teachers who have really known their subject and had the time and will to help me and to push me further when I came to them with questions or for help. At my current school, I have two maths teachers who are Oxbridge graduates, and in that respect they are by no means alone! At my school there is a dedicated programme for those wishing to apply to Oxford or Cambridge, and so when I decided that I would apply, there was a whole system in place to aid me. And because I'm white, and I'm male and I sound posh (I only wish I had as much money as my voice would lead you to believe), nobody ever looked at me and subconsciously gave across a message of scepticism. Nobody has had any cause whatsoever to doubt me. Part of that is my sex, race and class, but part of that is also my academic record: also in part of product of my sex, race and class. When I went to Cambridge for the interview, there was no bias of any kind from my white interviewers, and no discomfort on my part from being interviewed by people who all had different skin colour to me (I feel like this would be a thing; I stand to be corrected if not). Point is, now I have an offer from Cambridge, and I stand a good chance of getting in, and then! And then! The privilege really begins: I will rub shoulders with the future leaders of the United Kingdom, literally in the form of future politicians and figuratively in that I will know some of the next leaders of culture, the arts and the media etc. You see people from Oxford or Cambridge all the time in the highest positions in this country \u2013 our last two Prime Ministers were Oxford graduates, as was Jeremy Paxman, as were a whole bunch of comedians, including such people as John Oliver and even Andy Parsons (that last one surprised me). And this is just to name a few fields and people! If I am not among them, I will know some of them, and then I and my children, maybe even my grandchildren will be able to benefit from my knowing them. Now I realise to you and all the people reading this that I sound like I'm boasting: I'm not trying to, I'm sorry. The point is that I am privileged as fuck. Not because the gods of prejudice decreed that because I was born with fair skin that I would go on to be successful, but because in so many little ways, I was allowed to take advantage of my talent, and gain more privilege, which let me take even further advantage of my talent, and so on and so forth in a great loop. The system still shits on me; it shits on nearly everyone, but in some ways it shits on me less. It doesn't make the shit that's on me any better or lesser, but it does mean that some others have it worse. That was a wall of text, and I'm not sure I made my point entirely.

There are about 30 satellites 20,200 kilometres (12,600 mi) above the Earth. (Each circle is 26,600 kilometres (16,500 mi) radius due to the Earth's radius.) Far from the North Pole and South Pole, a GPS unit can receive signals from 6 to 12 satellites at once. Each satellite contains an atomic clock which is carefully set by NORAD several times every day.  > The radio signals contain very good time and position of the satellite. The GPS receiver subtracts the current time from the time the signal was sent. The difference is how long ago the signal was sent. The time difference multiplied by the speed of light is the distance to the satellite. The GPS unit uses trigonometry to calculate where it is from each satellite's position and distance. Usually there must be at least four satellites to solve the geometric equations.  > A GPS receiver can calculate its position many times in one second.

The way they make it sound, you might think that China has this uber-skilled cabal of expert hackers that are typing circles around their American counterparts. That's not accurate. China's ability to be a threat in Cyber-Warfare exists for the same reason that they're a threat in Conventional Warfare: They have *manpower*. China *basically* has a standing Bounty out on Data stolen from American Companies, Citizens, and Government. They pay reasonably well for *anything* that might be useful. They're not hacking into servers by being sophisticated and slipping around the security. They're hacking in by throwing a few *million* script-kiddies at the servers, and seeing who guesses a correct password first. **3) Botnets...** China's citizens are *not* good at securing their computers. As a result, most of the country's computers are part of *at least* one Botnet. So long as a computer that's part of a Botnet is turned on, it can be hijacked and used in a cyber attack. Botnets are *usually* used for brute-force techniques. DDOS Attacks are what they were *made for*. However, Botnets can also be used to get around a lot of password security. You can coordinate your Botnet, allowing you to try and brute-force a password even if the system locks you out after [X] attempts.

Imagine that in a long tube with only two small holes (up and down) to expand to. Also, when the foam comes up the esophagus, it goes not only out of the mouth but also into the trachea and lungs, where it can block some of the airflow, leading to shortness of breath. But this doesn't account for vomitin and diarrhea. Finally, soap can emulsify fat. Cell walls and the cell surface are, along with other materials, made from a lot of fat. Other than the skin, the mucous membrane (= skin of the intestines) doesn't have a lot of protection from its environment, so these cells are far more likely to take damage and burst. While the dysfunction already leads to symptoms, the body also reacts by removing the culprit (soap) from the stomach (vomiting) and lower intestines (diarrhea). All of this requires way more soap than what is left on your hands after washing them. TL;DR 1) The expansion of foam overstimulates pressure receptors all over the intestines 2) Dysfunction from damaged cells and the registration of a toxin lead to vomiting and diarrhea. 3) It takes more than just a little residual soap from your hands."}]}

(It's really a hotel/apartment/office building.) * The burglars got caught, and they had the names and contact info of WH staff on them, as well as a $25,000 campaign donation cashiers check in their bank accounts. * After the burglary, the CREEPs briefed Nixon about it. * Nixon held a press conference in which he falsely denied knowing anything about it, falsely claimed he had assigned WH Counsel John Dean to investigate, and falsely claimed Dean found no connection to the WH. * Nixon publicly ordered the FBI to investigate, but privately ordered them not to look too thoroughly. This was obstruction of justice, a felony. * He also secretly ordered the CIA to interfere with the FBI investigation, which is also obstruction of justice. * He later ordered various staffers to lie to the grand jury investigating Watergate, which is perjury. Yet more obstruction of justice. * As a result of the investigation, it came out that there was a secret taping system recording conversations in the Oval Office. Nixon tried to fire the Watergate special prosecutor when he demanded the tapes, and ultimately also fired the new Attorney General and Assistant AG when they refused to fire the prosecutor. (\"The Saturday Night Massacre.\") * Eventually Nixon handed over the tapes, which showed all the lies and obstruction of justice mentioned above, as well as the essentially immoral and illegal purpose of CREEP. The tapes also showed that Nixon routinely suborned the FBI, CIA, and IRS to investigate and persecute his political opponents and members of the press. * There is an 18 and a half minute gap in the tapes, which no one has ever explained. Given that the WH did turn over multiple instances of the president suborning oerjury, siccing federal agencies on private citizens, and obstructing justice, what could possibly have been so bad that they had to destroy it? Impeachment motions had been in the House already, but after the tapes, everybody knew it was a matter of time, and Nixon resigned. Ultimately 49 people went to jail for their participation in Watergate and CREEP, including the burglars, Nixon's Chief of Staff, several other Exec staffers, the former Attorney General, John Dean, etc. Prosecutors were very seriously considering pursuing Nixon himself for obstruction of justice; if they had done so, he would have almost certainly been convicted based in the evidence of the tapes.

{"id": "4hyt9w", "input": "why was late 18th and early to mid 19th century Conventional Warfare (such as the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars) so civil and organized?", "output": [{"answer": "The images of large blocks of infantry maneuvering before battle as if they were on a parade ground, and units marching in close formation while under fire, might look strange and overly formal to a modern observer, but there were practical reasons for doing things this way, it wasn't purely form or convention. As regards your first question, \"Wouldn't it make more sense to attack with a major charge while your enemy's troops were organizing?\" Armies didn't just march up to each other, then organize, and then attack. Armies would get into battle order at considerable distance, with the main battle lines, supporting units, and reserves occupying the general positions they would be in for the attack. Once they were in battle order they would then move forward into potential attacking range. So from a defenders perspective, by the time the enemy is close enough for me to attack, then they would also probably be well prepared and positioned to defend that attack. Most of the time it would be better to hold my position, especially if terrain gives me some advantage that I would lose by moving forwards. As for infantry marching in rank and file while taking fire, there are a few things to note. First of all, infantry wouldn't spend the entire battle doing this, it was generally only the relatively brief period of time when an attacking unit was attempting to close the distance with the enemy and then charge with bayonets, forcing the enemy unit to break or withdraw from their position. They did it in close order like this because, although they were vulnerable, it was really the only reliable way to get a large body of men to close that distance, charge the enemy, and then actually win that charge. For the charge to work effectively, physcially and psychologically, you need to have your people close together and acting as one unit rather than just as individuals. If they ran over the distance at full speed, then they would be winded and disorganized by the time they reach the enemy. If they moved forward as individuals, spaced out and taking cover, they'd probably move too slowly, would be too inclined to just sit in cover, and if they did get close enough to charge, the charge would be totally ineffective. Marching blocks of troops closing with the enemy would take heavy losses, but the slow reloading speed of muskets, and the cover provided by the clouds of smoke they caused, gave you a good chance of still having an effective force by the time you reached the enemy. If the attack fails, or looks like it will fail, then you can attack again with fresh units, or call off the attack. They wouldn't stand at close range for extended periods just exchanging fire. At longer range, infantry would be relatively safe from musket fire. If they were taking casualties from longer ranged weapons like artillery, it was quite common for commanders to take measures to reduce those casualties, such as having their men sit or lie down, or move behind cover if possible."}]}

{"id": "5epe4h", "input": "Why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?", "output": [{"answer": "It's both learned and related to development. All mammals have the instinct not to \"soil the nest\". We mostly train our babies out of this instinct by putting them in diapers and being totally oblivious to their signals that they want to pee, but it's possible to keep it going - there is a thing called Elimination Communication which is one of those \"parenting movements\" with an awful name but effectively, it's a googleable phrase which means you can find information about how to watch your infant for signs they are about to pee or poop and \"catch\" it in a little pot instead of using a diaper. This is also common practice in some non-Western cultures. Of course, if you want to do it at night you have to sleep in very close proximity to the infant. But doing this even very young babies will wake at night to pee and then go back to sleep. So partly we train them out of it and then have to train them back into it again when we potty train. What happens when potty training is that toddlers are learning to associate the feelings of a full bladder/bowel with the imminent arrival of pee, and control the muscles around the urethra to hold it long enough to get to a toilet first. Children sleep much more deeply than adults - they tend to sleep through noise, for example, much more easily - and it's common that for some time during and after potty training they are either not aware enough of the nerve endings around the bladder to pay attention to them even during sleep or they are just too deeply asleep to notice these sensations. Once they become more accustomed to paying attention to these signals, they'll be more likely to wake up, assuming they are not too deeply asleep. Secondly, the hormone part somebody mentioned below is also true but it's not strictly related to why we wake up, more the amount of pee created. The adult body produces a hormone called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) during sleep which tells the body to produce less urine during this time, meaning that adults rarely produce enough urine at night to get into a desperate enough state to wake us up. When we do, it's likely unusual enough that this is a significant factor as well. For children who haven't started producing this hormone yet (the exact age varies, but girls tend to develop it a couple of years earlier than boys, which is why boys are more likely to suffer from bedwetting for longer), the feeling of having a full bladder at night wouldn't necessarily be unusual meaning it's less likely to wake the child up. Lastly there is the simple fact that adults tend not to be afraid of the dark and additionally are much more aware of where their limit for *actually* peeing themselves is, whereas children might delay getting out of bed because they are cold, scared, or just sleepy and they don't have as good of a handle on that tipping point yet because they don't have as much experience. (This is the same reasoning for why young children sometimes hold on so long that they just pee themselves because they were too busy playing or didn't know that they didn't have enough time to get to the toilet, whereas this rarely happens to adults without incontinence issues.) But again, this isn't strictly the same situation since you mentioned **waking**."}]}

They also know how to communicate with each other, maintain a constant link between each other and the cell tower has a \"capacity\" of number of phones it can talk to at one time; which cannot be broken - after this number it will not accept communications from another phone (for simplicity sake I'll state that your WiFi router is not limited in this way - it is limited, but not in the same way: that's a separate ELI5...) Imagine you and your friends out in a field and you've all got a set of alphabet flashcards of different sizes (from postage stamp size up to A1) each with their own colour. You tell your friends to go and stand in a line about 10m apart from each other all facing you and then use the cards to send you a message. You will respond to them with the cards of their own colour as you have a set of all the colours. The guy 10m from you holds up the A1 sized cards to start, and you're not able to see anyone else behind him because the card is in the way, so when you see the A1 sized card, you show your card to say you've got the message - but also that he needs to use a smaller sized card (the postage stamp one because you can read that from 10m away). This means that you and he can communicate (him using postage stamp sized cards, you using his coloured cards) While this is happening all you other friends are also holding up their A1 sized cards trying to get a message from you, but because you can't see them and so aren't responding, they keep trying the first part of the message. As the first guy changes to the postage stamp sized cards, you can see the 2nd guy and respond, tell him to use a smaller card, but bigger than the postage stamp so you can read it still from 20m away. This continues down the line until you can see all of your friends and they're all using different sized cards. They know which messages are for them because your cards are colour coded, and you've made sure that you can see all of their cards, so you can talk to them all. This means that your friend furthest away can still talk to you, even though he's a long way away. He's holding up the large card, which can be seen over all the smaller cards infront of it. This is like transmission power, phones nearer the tower are told to turn down their transmission power so that the tower can see what's happening \"behind\" them. This only works because the tower creates an unbroken link between itself and each phone that it is talking to, so it has a record of what phone is on what power and how to talk to that phone. Because the tower then knows what it is looking for to communicate with the phone, the phone doesn't need to be transmitting with such high power. There's a whole load more going on, if you're interested then drop me a PM and i'll explain more. TL,DR: It's not just 1 single thing that enables cell phones to work - there's a whole system designed specifically to get around range problems and a lot of smart things happening all at once."}]}

There are too many chefs in this kitchen, and essentially the atmosphere is so toxic that you can't even start your own practice without a significant investment. A few things off of the top of my head. 1)in the US we can also have different types of healthcare providers. some are HMO where the integration of services is vertical(kaiser permanente comes to mind, although correct me if im wrong) 2)providers can be part of a network(this is where they accept different insurances and its their choice) 3)ICD-10 is basically a coding system that allows you to bill for different services, BUT those services have to be coded properly otherwise the insurance company rejects your claim. An Acute myocardial infarction(heart attack) has the code I21. now, depending on which anatomical place in the heart the infarction occurred is a different code ranging from I21.0-I21.9. Was it an older infarction? then its I25.2...you can see where I'm going with this. So as a private practice physican you have to learn to code properly, or have someone do it so you get paid for your services. Then you have to have a secretary who also doubles as your medical assistant so you can have the proper paperwork for YOUR records and so that she can do the basic shit like bp, hr, shots, and other basic tests. 4)Then you have to pay for the space for your practice. Think you are going to find deals? Nope, companies realized that they can charge ridiculous prices for rent knowing full well you can't go anywhere else. 5)That private practice that you have with all those fancy computers. Well those fancy computers need IT support because the government has mandated that if you want to take medicare then you have to have EMR. Do you know how big of a clusterfuck all those EMR programs are? Some paid programs are so complicated and resource heavy that you now need new computers. 6)Want to make money? Well now you have to see patients in 30 minute time slots so you can make enough to pay your expenses (including your salary). The bigger your practice gets, the more staff, the more IT, now start paying for workers insurance... 7)So may physicians thought they would be smart and have their own group. This worked really well for a while until they got sick and tired of the headache of running a practice and got bought out by local hospitals. 8)you go to the hospital and have a procedure. The hospital bills insurance and you(whatever is not covered by insurance). The rates of procedures vary greatly from area to area. A surgery such as a heart bypass may cost 30K in NJ but 23.5 k in houston. Btw, the 30k doesnt all go to the surgeon. You have to pay the 2 nurses, the anesthesiologist, the surgical tech, the bypass operator, the PA(sometimes), the hospital for time in the room AND the surgeon. Don't forget the hospital needs to make a profit as well. So out of that 30k the surgeon may see 5k. 9)So how do they determine the cost for procedures? Really, its geography dependent. If you take medicare then every year or so the medicare payment advisory committee sits down with doctors from the AHA to discuss payments for procedures. The thing is, the size of the pot doesn't really change from year to year. So lets say you have $100 dollars, and you have to divvy it up by paying for certain procedures. Well next year derms want to get paid more for their services, so where does that extra money come from? Some other specialty is going to get paid LESS for the procedures that they do and you get this constant circle jerk/bitchfest. 10)Hospitals try to minimize cost by signing their staff to 3/5 year contracts so you slowly prevent the inflation of salaries. 11)healthcare is a money maker in this country so you have every tom dick and harry wanting to suck on the teet that is healthcare because they know that they will get rich doing it. Theres a bit more to this issue, but I forgetting my train of thought as I'm late to start my studying. if you guys have any questions, ask away.

Part of that is the DNS ~~system~~ - that maps names ( URL_3 ,  URL_1   URL_2  etc.) to ip address. Ip addresses are the things actually computer equipment uses to talk to each other. The DNS ~~system~~ was created by treaty (edit: a treaty agreeing that everyone in the ITU was going to just use the US system, not that the treaty actually built the system), and while the top of it is a non profit organization it still 'owns' the right to give out top level domains to countries, every country has their own registrar (for .ca, .uk, .us, .fr etc.) and the US owns a few others (.com, .gov. mil), some countries have more than one (e.g. Russia/Soviet Union), and somewhat like wireless spectrum, ownership is implicitly assumed to belong to national governments, and you need the permission of their agencies to own a domain. They contract out these services to various companies. Now for example, lets say I wanted to own  URL_4  - I'd find the organization responsible for handing out domains on .ca and ask them for it. That organization needs to handle requests for names, it needs to resolve disputes (what if you own  URL_0  already, but I own a competing business in Canada already called  URL_4 , and how do you resolve this dispute?). All of those people who handle that stuff need to be paid. And then the physical hardware that stores this information needs to be paid for, and people and software that connect to the world all need to be paid for. Companies that sell these things are allowed to do so by national governments - Verisign which is the big one in the US does so with the approval of the US Department of Commerce. In addition to paying for your national registry there are 13 root name server (2 of which are controlled by verisign, the other 11 each have one operator), these form the backbone of the name - >  IP address system. All of those servers need to be kept reasonably in sync with each other and they all need to keep running. 13 was a technical limitation at one point, but now we also have replication of those servers - your ISP probably runs a clone of one of those 13 for example and when you access the internet you're probably doing so via the clone. But either way, the web traffic those servers could have to handle is significant, the reliability requirements are extreme, and keeping everyone happy is expensive. So that's what you're paying for - people to make sure that when you buy a domain I can't buy the same one, that we agree on where that domain points, and that it will be the same everywhere, and all of the equipment used to make sure that happens."}]}

Third, access to birth control of some form is common to most human societies, but sometimes it was in some way \"secret knowledge,\" so it was lost in times of great social upheaval. The stereotypical huge American families of the prairies, for example, might have had something to do with the fact that Ma had no one to buy pig-intestine condoms from . . .

Since I know a few people (including myself) who taught themselves how to raise their eyebrows/wiggle their ears, I do not think it's just genetics. Quick guide to moving your eyebrows/ears: Find a mirror. Then, make faces until you find one that coincidentally also moves your eyebrow/ears. For moving your ears, try suddenly widening your eyes and lifting your eyebrows up in surprise -- you'll notice that your ears would would slightly move up when you do so. For eyebrows, it's a bit tougher. I was always able to raise my left eyebrow while furrowing the other (kind of like a \"are you kidding me?\" look), so I taught myself how to raise my right eyebrow, and also how to raise my left without furrowing my right. Basically, I kept lifting up my right eyebrow while staring at my face and trying to keep down my left, sometimes with my hands. Unlike for the ears, there isn't a real trick for this, though thinking a sarcastic \"are you joking?\" helped me. It took a few days, but my face got the hang of it. Oh, bonus: if you want to be able to look super cross-eyed (one eye looking straight, another eye looking at your nose), try going cross-eyed first, and then suddenly trying to stare at someone in front of you while being cross-eyed."}]}
{"id": "40ove5", "input": "Why does .9999 repeating equal 1?", "output": [{"answer": "All of these responses are cute manipulations that can be useful to motivate something but are not rigorous. It's really subjective. You've seen some of the cute manipulations before, but they don't convince you, and then you see one and it kind of does, but maybe you'll think about it a bit more later and end up unsatisfied. I'll try to give you an understanding of the rigorous way mathematicians talk about this. The most common explanation here uses the fact that we agree that 0.333..= 1/3. The thing is that if you have a problem with 0.9999.. being one you should also have a problem with 0.33333... being 1/3. Because no matter how far you go, 0.3333 will never be 1/3. 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, etc. are not 1/3, you have to go \"infinitely far\" for it to be a third, kind of like the problem that people have that no matter how you go 0.9999 repeating will not quite be one. To rigorously capture the idea of what we mean by infinitely far, we've invented the limit. We teach these decimals to elementary schoolers because they discover them by long division (for fun, try dividing 2 by 2, but in the first step instead of writing one put a decimal point, you end up with 0.9999...), but repeating decimals allude to a pretty advanced (high-school - college level depending on how rigorous you want to be) idea, the idea of an infinite series. 0.333333... Just means 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + ... or an infinite series with first term 0.3 and common ratio 0.1. Similarly 0.99999.. Means 0.9 + 0.09+ 0.009 + ... For a finite series, we can find by simple manipulations that the sum of a series with n terms, first term a and common ratio r is a(1-r^n) / (1-r). (These manipulations are of course OK because the series is finite). Here's the manipulation if you want to see it: a+ar+...+ar^(n-1)= S ar+ar^(2)+...+ar^(n)=Sr S-Sr=a-ar^n S=a(1-r^(n))/(1-r) If r < 1 and we let n towards infinity, we find that the LIMIT of the sum is a/(1-r) because r^n goes to zero. What does it mean that r^n goes to zero as n approaches infinity? The rigorous definition of something going to zero as n approaches infinity is that eventually, it gets as small as you want. You want all the terms to be less than 0.00001? That happens if you go far enough into the series. The confusion is exactly that which leads to Zeno's paradox, and really the fundamental confusion about limits; the exact confusion that limits were invented to resolve. Our definition of limit DODGES the idea of infinity in a way, because we get closer and closer, and we say that we can get as close as we want by going far enough, so for all purposes we can say that, for example, the sum of the whole infinite series is a/(1-r). For example, in the series 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 +..., if you tell me you want that to be within 0.0001 of 1/3, I can do that! It's really easy to see here, because 0.0001 **0.3333**33..  < - anything past what is bolded is smaller than 0.0001. The other common explanations are things like: x=0.999... 10x=9.9999... 10x-x=9 therefore x=1 !! Well a lot of manipulations like this do work, even with things like square roots and partial fractions. But you're literally multiplying infinite series by constants and subtracting them and nobody proved that you can do this. In general, actually, these kinds of \"obviously okay\" manipulations can give you contradictions like 1=2. You have to be really careful. The people talking about 0.000...1 being an infinitesimal.. Because repeating decimals are infinite series where we specify a number between 0 and 9 inclusive for every natural number (the \"decimal place\") and shove it into the decimal places, what does this mean, does the last 1 go in the spot for the \"biggest\" natural number? Well there isn't one. We are allowed to use repeating decimals in the first place because they correspond to infinite series, which infinite series does this correspond to? You have to specify for every decimal place a digit, and there's no place you can put the 1. If on the other hand, you want to talk about the limit of the series, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, ..., a question that is valid, the answer is zero. You can use infinitesimals because there are some ways to define them. But if you don't know they're defined, you don't know what you're allowed to do with them! 0.0...1 doesn't correspond to any infinite series, and the only reasonable way to define it as a limit shows it to be zero. This isn't a good way to define infinitesimals, worse, playing around with it will give you some contradictions. The people arguing that 0.00...1 is infinitesimal have never actually taken a nonstandard analysis class. There are a couple of ways to define infinitesimals, each with its drawbacks (the ultrafilter definition requires Axiom of Choice, which leads to unsettling results like Banach-Tarski and the hat problem (as well as the issue of using axiom of choice for analysis!), and the nil-squared infinitesimals require you to throw out law of the excluded middle, proof by contradiction, all functions that aren't smooth, and nonconstructive proofs and you need to use intuitionist logic). There's nothing wrong with the intuitive explanations AT ALL. In fact, they're incredibly important to motivate the idea and give you an idea of why it should be true. Hopefully, seeing the plethora of them should give you an idea of why it should be one. But if you've looked at the explanations, have a bit of an idea of why it should be one but are still unsatisfied, that's what mathematical rigor is for, and I hope to have given you an idea of how mathematics resolves this particular question in this response. If you want a fuller explanation, it'll be explained in the beginning of any analysis or higher-level calculus book, or in the beginning of corresponding classes. Or PM me!"}]}

{"id": "4bidcj", "input": "Why is it that in the past, society could afford really elaborate, ornate public buildings or big civic projects, but now there seems to be no money for anything but the most functional buildings, and we can barely pay for road maintenance?", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of those fancy building projects were made in mind to appeal to the public directly. And many weren't even made by the government, but rather private investors. Why would rich people spend money on public works? Because prior to the 17th Amendment, it was essentially impossible to bribe/lobby congress. Senators were directly selected by state legislature, and any senator that put his personal interests above that of their state were removed by the state. The house of representatives couldn't be directly bribed either, since it relied entirely on the will of the people, and the people were more inclined to vote back then. So instead of bribing congressmen directly, businessmen and their corporations would attempt to bribe the people. This is why Carnage and friends built a whole lot of libraries, and donated a whole lot of money to local churchs that belongs to denominations different from their own personal beliefs. Local areas would receive some kind of public gift, then those local politicans and leaders would be encouraged to tell their local communities to vote for so and so because they are friends with Carnage or whoever. When the 17th Amendment hit, the people and their votes no longer mattered. The state could no longer recall senators as easily, and the senate became a redundant house of representatives that weren't held to account by the voters, because the senate operates under completely different rules. It makes more sense, politically, to keep a bad senator in power than it does a member of the house. There is way more political power concentrated in the hands of a senator, so the majority of focus was switched to buying senators. After all, you only need 1 or 2 senators per state to match what 10 or more representatives can accomplish. Just look at california. 53 house representatives. There's no way a person or group of people can bribe all of them. But 2 senators? Easy. Another aspect to this is that many public work projects were created simply to fullfill a person or group of people's hubris. In the big cities, competing people and their organizations would get into money spending pissing contests to see who could build the biggest or most grandest thing. During this time period, the rich were proud to be rich, they loved the public eye, they weren't constantly being threatened by the lower classes with insane rhetoric like \"eat the rich\". Now, the wealthier members of our society and extremely detached from everyone else. And this leads to the social expatiation. Not only did the rich enjoy building fanciful things, so did the general public. This is a large part of nationalism/patriotism that gets kicked to the side lines when people discuss the pros and cons of such isms. People were proud of themselves and their country, and they wanted their building projects to reflect that. Try to create some grandiose public work project today and you will get hundreds of politically motivated groups crucifying you publicly. \"It's a WASTE\" \"the money should go to SCHOOLS INSTEAD\" \"Do you knowHOW MANY SINGLE MOTHERS YOU COULD FEED WITH THAT BUDGET?\" and emotionally charged appeals of that nature. tldr; we don't build fancy public work stuff anymore because it's not politically correct for the government to do so, and there's no benefit for private citizens to do so."}]}

{"id": "33qjiy", "input": "Why does it seem that the more religious a society is, the more anti-sex it is?", "output": [{"answer": "Lot of cynicism in this thread. Can I offer an alternate explanation? Because I feel the issue of \"control\" is being read from some profoundly anti-religious premises. I think it's more fair to say that most religions have as a goal to inspire their followers to positive collective actions (however some have perverted this goal). A fundamental aspect of this is that it requires individuals to learn how to be in possession of their own individual desires and instincts, so those may be directed toward a greater good rather than for their own sake. In other words, to rule their desires rather than to be ruled by them. Each faith approaches this in its own way. Alcohol consumption, for instance, is a powerful and addictive physical pleasure that may, in moderation, promote eusocial behavior but in excess causes socially undesirable things. So religious followers are encouraged to drink in moderation or to abstain altogether not because the church relishes mind control, but because alcohol abuse can compromise an individual's ability to positively contribute to their community. Sex being one of the most powerful human instincts, it shouldn't be surprising that religious people are encouraged to rule their sexual desire rather than be ruled by it. Again each faith approaches this differently, but historically most western religions have seen too little eusocial benefit to sex beyond its capacity to strengthen the bonds of a heterosexual marriage and to produce new babies to grow their communities. Weighed against some pretty negative possible consequences of unregulated desire (STIs, unwanted pregnancies, not to mention rape) it followed that teaching belIevers to master their desire by restricting sex to within marriage was the right bumper-sticker message. Where this misses the boat, of course, is that it neglected the eusocial benefits non-marital and non-hetero sex can have. As some Christian denominations came to realize that their communities functioned better when committed gay couples were welcomed instead of shunned, or when children were trusted with factual sex education, some have softened their positions. The calculus should have been clear from the beginning: that repressing non-marital sexual behavior actually had an anti-social effect (unwanted and teen pregnancy) and so did persecuting homosexuals for their sexual orientation (the 80s AIDS crisis, gay suicide, and anti-gay hate crime). All of these hamper the ability of a community to come together and work for the common good-- which is why I'm na\u00efvely optimistic that in the long run, we'll see most mainstream religions evolve to have more positive attitudes about sex that see or more inclusively as the social good that it is... But they will still teach their followers to rule over and channel their sexual urges so that it stays within the boundaries in which it remains beneficial to society. TL;DR: Religions teach followers to master their physical desires, so that they can be assets to collective good - in the same way defensive driving or gun safety classes train the eusocial uses of potentially anti-social behavior."}]}

Rather, it is slightly more correct to say that the Moon orbits the Sun. Here's why: when one body orbits another, one does not actually orbit the other, but rather both orbit around the center of mass of the two bodies. That is to say that your typical moon does not orbit the exact center of its planet, but rather some other point dependent on the mass of the two bodies and their separation. And when you add other nearby bodies, things get even messier. And in the case of Earth and its Moon (and one moon of Jupiter), there exists a very special circumstance: the gravity of the Sun pulls more strongly on the moon than the gravity of the planet does. What that means is that if you parked yourself at a \"fixed\" point way above the north pole of the Sun and looked down onto the plane of the solar system, and then ignored everything you see except for, say, the ISS, what you would see would be the thing making loops. It is *truly* orbiting the Earth, because Earth's gravity pulls more strongly on it than than of the Moon or Sun. But if you look at the Moon, it would NOT be making loops, it would be making a sine-like pattern (everywhere concave towards the Sun, if you wanna get precise)."}]}

{"id": "5ymqlt", "input": "What would happen if everybody (US) paid the same tax rate?", "output": [{"answer": "Assuming that we took careful care to set the rate such that overall government revenues would not change. In addition we'd have to look at deductions and credits, but let's say we eliminated them as well. Let's assume that all of those problems are addressed and you find a perfect percentage to charge everyone and keep all government revenues exactly the same. What you are asking about here is called a \"flat tax\". This is where everyone pays literally the exact same percentage of their income in taxes. While this seems very fair, once you take a close look it's VERY not fair. The reason it's considered unfair is because poor people tend to spend much higher percentages of their income on a class of expenses known as necessities of life. We're talking things like food, water, clothing and shelter. Things that are required to keep you alive. Let's take a poor (but not too poor) person. They make $700 per month and pay $500 per month in housing, the rest on food. The housing that they can get for $500 is the cheapest available in their city. OK, but mostly shit and includes roommates. They eat very little and fairly badly on $50 per week. If you charge this person a 10% tax rate, they need to pay $50 per month in taxes. Thie reduces their food budget by 25%, so now they don't get to eat for the last week of every month. Now lets look at a rich person. They earn $10,000 per month and spend $5,000 per month on housing. They eat well, spending $150 per week and have plenty of money leftover for savings and other luxuries. A 10% tax on this rich person will not impact their food budget. It will mean they put less into savings, or spend less on luxury items, perhaps they might select a cheaper home. But they will not go hungry. Basically what I'm getting at here is that poor people spend a much higher percentage of their income on the necessities of life than wealthy people do. Even in cases where a rich and poor person both spend the same percentage of their income on something like housing (a rare case, but one that can exist), it's still unfair because the rich person is able to spend less on a less nice home whereas the poor person is already in the cheapest home available. This is where the concepts of discretionary spending come into play. A wealthy person has not only more money to spend but more ability to decide where to spend the money that they have. Poor people are restricted because they are already scraping the bottom of the barrel to get anything, so there's not really any room to move downwards. So a flat tax actually is considered regressive (poor people pay more) because we should be looking at discretionary income, not total income. That's the intent of our tax system, to take into account the fact that poorer people don't have as much room to move and save as richer people do. So we say if you make less than X amount you don't need to pay anything as you don't have any discretionary income. As you move up the income chain, more and more of your income is discretionary. therefore we charge you a higher and higher percentage of income. If you make $1,000,000 per month, you likely have a VERY expensive house and some nice cars, but you don't NEED those things to live. At that level, 99% of your income is discretionary."}]}

Here are some of the most common. 1- She accepted donations from shady sources including infamous 3rd world dictators and embezzled funds. She also associated with various questionable figures, and took sides in Indian politics. 2- She used very little of the donations for actual charity. Much of the donations she received went to either missionary work or the general RCC funds, even when earmarked for charity. The exact proportion is unknown because she refused to release any info except where absolutely required by law. 3- The medical care she offered did not meet standards, even for third world hospice care. And quotes like this, \"I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people,\" and \"the most beautiful gift for a person that he can participate in the sufferings of Christ,\" certainly don't put her in the best light. Her goal was never to treat the poor sick. Her goals were conversion and to help people suffer properly to prepare their souls for the afterlife. Added to this the fact that she went to western hospitals when she herself got sick, makes her look like a hypocrite as well. 4- She had patients baptized, apparently without a full and proper Catechism or understanding of what was being done to them. Now your view on whether these are bad are not depends on your point of view on these subjects. Maybe she was a devoted missionary who took a hold of whatever tools she could to perform an important duty. Or maybe she was a sadistic individual who hung out with evil men and tortured her so called patients. But in any case she wasn't the saintly medical caregiver as she was frequently portrayed."}]}
{"id": "8mnqkv", "input": "How does an ant not die when flicked full force by a human finger?", "output": [{"answer": "It has to do with how forces scale up and down with size and mass. If you attempt to hammer a nail, while grasping the hammer at the top, it's very hard to put any force in it, because you have less leverage and therefor less force. Also trying to hammer a nail with a feather doesn't work even if you grasp it at the bottom because the mass is lower, it's hard to put any energy into it. It would also be hard to hammer a nail, even with a big heavy hammer, if you held onto the piece of wood in your hand, so that every time you struck the nail, your arm absorbed the energy instead of the nail. IE if something can move to absorb energy, then you can't deliver the full blow of energy into it and drive the nail home, because you just push it out of the way instead of hammer into it. Ants are both small, so their limbs, bodies, head, etc cannot have much leverage or twisting, bending, force applied against them, and they are very light, like the feather, so they can be flicked, or fall long distances without building up enough inertia to cause damage. The longer something is, like your legs, or arms, the more force can be applied to it. For instance if you fall off a 2 story building, your limbs striking the ground can put a lot of force on your joints, breaking bones. If you had stubs, those stubs would suffer less damage than the rest of your body because the force of striking the ground would put less force on the stubs than a long limb. And the more massive something is, the more potential energy it can develop which results in a greater force when falling and hitting something. Higher mass also results in more inertia, meaning it takes longer for the object to accelerate or more force to make it accelerate at the same rate as a lighter object. For comparison, imagine punching a punching bag, versus punching a feather. The punching bag has mass and when you strike it, it resists moving, which allows the force of your punch to be delivered into the bag. But when you punch a feather, it has such low mass that instead of absorbing the energy of your punch, it simply gets moved out of the way by it."}]}
{"id": "8h1299", "input": "Why do people sometimes get very giddy/laugh uncontrollably after nearly dying?", "output": [{"answer": "That's a common side effect of the fight-or-flight response. When you're suddenly in a dangerous situation like an incoming car or an animal attack, your brain sends signals to your adrenal glands (little lumpy bits on top of your kidneys) to start producing various hormones, such as adrenaline and dopamine. When that happens, your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate, your hearing is muffled, your digestive system slows down, and your muscles start burning energy faster, all so you can focus on either defending yourself or running away without having to stop and think about it. Of course having all those hormones suddenly flooding into your system has side effects, one of them being giddiness/laughing. This is likely caused by the hormone dopamine. It's typically produced when you feel pleasure, but also when you feel pain (physical and emotional), to help suppress it and calm you down. This can sometimes result in giddiness and nervous laughter in some people when they are really hurt or upset."}]}
{"id": "yme8s", "input": "If there isn't a law banning gay marriage, why isn't it legal?", "output": [{"answer": "For this, it is important to keep in mind the differences between state and federal law. Some states have passed amendments to their Constitution, or through the legislature, that have defined marriage as between one man and one woman. So in order for your spouse to receive benefits on your behalf, such as unemployment insurance or state income taxes, you must be in a \"legal\" marriage, which to those states, is between one man and one woman. At the federal level, it is similar, but a bit more vague. You have probably heard of DOMA, or the Defense of Marriage Act. This law [defined]( URL_0 ) marriage as \"a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.\" So in order to receive federal benefits for your spouse (such as Medicare, Social Security, etc.), or to file your taxes jointly (which can save you lots of money), you must be in a \"legal\" marriage, defined that way. TL;DR You're not going to jail for being in a gay marriage, but depending on what state your live in, you won't be able to receive the same kinds of benefits that a straight marriage would receive."}]}
{"id": "5n3sfx", "input": "The differences between Heavy Metal, Thrash metal, Black metal, and Death metal.", "output": [{"answer": "I wrote my dissertation on this very topic and I don't think anyone's nailed it in their answers yet. Edit - I've only got a hard copy of the dissertation (I graduated years ago). Thanks to everyone who asked to read it, if I remember I'll try and scan it. Crash91 has got a lot right but has made a few points I disagree with. So, Heavy Metal - This grew out of Hard Rock and used the same scales, rhythms and subject matter. Black Sabbath are widely cited as the first true Heavy Metal band, giving birth to both the Heavy Metal genre in general and the Doom Metal genre in particular. Led Zepellin, Deep Purple etc are Hard Rock and are only accepted as Heavy Metal bands in the US. In the UK Heavy Metal begins with Sabbath. Original Heavy Metal was fairly slow, gloomy, bluesy and lyrically dealt with subjects such as war, drugs, religion and occult themes. Vocals clean and sung. Later iterations in the 70s, such as Saxon, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are also considered Heavy Metal but are sometimes referred to as NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) and were pioneers of the 'chugging' guitar sound people often associate with classic Heavy Metal as well as the use of twin guitar harmonised leads. Generally faster and more bombastic, the vocals of NWOBHM were more high pitched and the lyrics while dealing with similar themes, more fantastical. Hair or Glam Metal also grew out of this style (but it's awful!). Thrash Metal - Thrash was a product of the 80s and metal's reaction to the aggression of Punk in the late 70s. The band that kick started the whole thing were Venom from Newcastle in the UK. They are sometimes classed as NWOBHM but they don't really fit in that category because they were pretty poor musicians. Their contribution was mainly down to aural extremity, though they sound fairly tame now. They had a 'heavier' sound than previous bands combining speed, harsher distortion tone on their guitars, faux satanic lyrics and shouted/growled vocals. They were a big influence on a lot of Thrash and Black metal bands but were pretty rubbish themselves (controversial opinion!). Early Thrash was pretty loose and messy with a lot of poor musicianship, bands like Sodom, Kreator and Destruction (Germany) made an unholy racket and began to attract the punk kids as well as the metalheads. Later bands worked out how to play their instruments better and the drumming in particular became more accomplished. Classic Thrash as played by the big four (Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer and Anthrax) combines very fast drumming often using 'punkier' beats, NWOBHM guitar riffs played at faster speeds, more aggressive vocals and 'face ripping' (extremely fast and shrill) solos which are often atonal (not in any given key!). Lyrically Thrash was concerned with politics, nuclear war and occult/satanic themes. Death Metal - In the late 80s there was a lot of genre cross pollination and this lead to Death Metal and Grindcore (as well as many other specialist 'cores). Death Metal ramps up the intensity, complexity, heaviness and obscenity of Thrash Metal. It downtunes the guitars (makes them sound deeper) and is characterised by a particular drum beat known as the 'blast beat', and the use of double kick pedals on the bass drum to achieve a rumbling, machine-gun like effect. The vocals are extremely low grunts, growls and roars and are almost impossible to decipher without a lyric sheet. Similar to Thrash, early Death Metal bands struggled to make their musicianship meet their intentions but later bands and a lot of modern bands play music of quite dizzying complexity utilising odd time signatures and even bizarre tunings (tuning the strings on their guitars differently) to make the sound more unsettling. This is the overall 'heaviest' style of metal sonically and lyrically deals with all manner of things including but not limited too, gore, zombies, war, sexual perversions, horror movies, torture and ancient Egypt (that's just one band called Nile from the US to be fair). Death Metal's heyday was the late 80s and early 90s but there's still plenty of great modern Death Metal being made today. While Thrash is seen as a retro style that will always evoke the early 80s, Death Metal has evolved much further and incorporated far more styles including, doom, prog, industrial and middle eastern/oriental music. Black Metal - This one's a bit unique as it all began with a small group of teenagers in Jessheim in Norway in the late 80s/early 90s. They wanted to be 'evil' and 'extreme' but they lacked the musical ability to rival the predominantly (at the time) Swedish and American Death Metal scenes. So instead they did what anyone would do (not) they started burning down churches, proclaiming themselves 'Satanists' and killing each other. They were influenced by bans such as Venom (UK), Mercyful Fate (Denmark) and Celtic Frost (Switzerland) all of whom had elements of NWOBHM and Thrash in their sounds but distinguished themselves by being 'Satanic' with varying degrees of seriousness. Whether or not they were serious, the kids in Norway took it all very seriously and out of that scene came what's come to be known as the 'Second Wave of Black metal', generally accepted as it's 'classic' phase. This style is typified by ultra lo-fi production values including lots of hiss, feedback and distortion a focus on treble rather than bass and vocals that were shrieked or screamed rather than grunted or growled. The music itself is far more primitive and basic than Death Metal and often utilises fast tremolo (rapid down/up strokes on a single string) guitar parts and minor scale arpeggios. Guitar solos are rare. Due to these production techniques the music can take on a hypnotic quality where it's passed through heavy on to something more languid on the other side. Critics say it's poorly played, badly recorded and the product of stupid teenagers with offensive views. The early Norwegian black metal guitar sound has often been likened to a swarm of angry wasps in a box but those who love it find something spiritual about it. The lyrics deal with Satanism of course but also a strand of Nietzschean elitism and an affinity with the Norwegian landscape (ice, frost, forests, mountains etc). Later Black Metal has evolved in myriad ways and incorporated allsorts of other styles including folk, celtic, oriental/middle eastern, prog, goth, shoegaze and traditional Nordic music. Offshoots include Blackened Death Metal, Viking Metal and Symphonic Black metal which combines the music with sweeping orchestral backing. Hope this helps, I could go on for days. If you want recommendations, here are mine; Heavy Metal - Paranoid by black Sabbath NWOBHM - British Steel by Judas Priest Thrash Metal - Reign in Blood by Slayer Death Metal - Demigod by Behemoth Melodic Death Metal - Slaughter of the Soul by At The Gates Black Metal - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk by Emperor Someone asked for a tl;dr so; Heavy Metal - Clean vocals, bluesy riffs, witches, weed and war. Thrash Metal - Speedy guitar riffs, punk attitude, hardcore drumming, shouty vocals, political lyrics. Death Metal - Downtuned guitars, complex riffs, machine gun drums, grunting/growling vocals, lyrics about horror movies, zombies and gore. Black metal - Trebly guitars, simple riffs, atmospheric arrangements, shrieking vocals, Satanism."}]}

This represents an incredible amount of energy. From Wikipedia values, it's equivalent to the estimated energy left in our ground in the form of oil. That's right : that degree that seems so small represents the whole global oil supply. When you've understood how gigantic that exactly is, it's no wonder that it's gonna cause such a shift in our ecosystems. A lot of ice is going to melt = >  more water. The surface waters are gonna get warmer = >  they will expand = >  higher sea level ! That's the most obvious consequence. Clearly this is also gonna take its toll on biodiversity, since the change is too rapid for species to evolve accordingly at our scale. This mostly means that the tropical climate is spreading further away from the equator ; a side effect is the proliferation of mosquitoes. Aside from that, scientists assume that more energy in the atmosphere means a higher number of hurricanes, storms and floods, but the observations over the last years have not yet confirmed it."}]}
{"id": "448p9x", "input": "Why, when carrying cargo, do helicopters dangle it so far below the helicopter while in transport?", "output": [{"answer": "When the cargo is on the long line, the pilot can look out the open door, thru the bubble window if installed meaning you don't have to open the door or down thru the floor mounted viewing port. This gives you an excellent view of exactly where the load is as opposed to looking at it with the small underside mirror you would use if you short line the load. Being able to look straight down the long line makes it so much easier to position the load when you need to be within inches of the target position. When moving diamond drills for instance, you have to have motor or tower hovering almost exactly over matching holes so that crew can insert bolts to put the drill together. If the process takes a long time for the crew to due, if for instance it is windy, you are watching it happen down the line and can make small corrections of the position of the load the aid the process. If you are slinging a load into a clearing in the trees with a long line, even if the clearing is big enough for the helicopter to fit, it is better to be up above the trees and in the wind, because any breeze helps the helicopter produce lift. If the load is near the maximum that you can lift, and it always is, then you will enjoy being above the trees for the entire duration of the lift. On a short line, when you go down into the clearing, the wind dies down, the lift decreases and the helicopter might sink under little control because you are near the maximum for being able to hover with the load. The guys under you in this instance are not pleased to have their work space intruded on by an out of control load. I always used a long line because I had much better control of the slinging operation with it. In the winter you also had a much better view when the guys went unhook the load and got zapped by tremendous amounts of static electricity. Another advantage of a long line is that if the load starts to fly apart, think sheets of plywood cinched together and the straps let go, then the load on the long line is far away from the helicopter which means foreign object damage is not a concern. Another example of a long line being ideal is if you have the camp groceries in a net on the end of a long line, you can park them right next to the cook tent door for ease of delivery. You are so far up that the downwash isn't a concern on the ground. Generally speaking there is always a little more wind just seventy or a hundred feet up, so staying up in that air when hovering is always better. Another good fact about long lining is that you aren't down where the rotor downwash will make a tarp, jacket, garbage bag or whatever fly up into your main rotor, tail rotor, or compressor intake. Lots of helicopters get killed by them. Nuff said."}]}

Every country is a little different when it comes to cc frauds so i will tell you guys how its done in canada. First and formost is to collect the credit card data. This was very easy to do in the late 90s and early 2000s. Yu could collect credit data by applying a skimming device on an atm machine. The skimming device is a little cover piece that fits perfectly on the mouth piece of where yu inject ur card. These were made by highly skilled people who would sell them to low level fraudsters. The skimmer could only record the card data not the pin so a camera is usually hidden to record the pin. If yu happened to cover your pin then the card info would only work for swiping at retailers. If yu got the pin then yu could withdrawl from the card and yu would be getting debits and credits. Once the skimmibg device and camera is placed the fraudster would wait for a few hours and come back and remove it. Once home he watched the video and extracts the info. Using a reader/writer which can be bought on kijiji or online he copies the data which for yu who dont know are just numbers. All it takes to copy the card is to swipe a blank card in the reader click write on the program swipe card few more times and then double check if its written there. Next he records the pin on the card using a pen so he remembers. Forgot to mention the cards. Yu can use anything walk into a gas statio. And steal gift cards or purchase what are called faces which are Fake cc cards that are printed and engraved and embosed just like yhe real thing. No one can tell except if yu look at the card signature which is rough so yu can sign it but on the faces they are shiny cause it was printed. If a card is signed with a marker its probally fake. Walk into a store with the face swipe and ur gone. When your info gets stolen like this the card will work.for a while because the banks really thinks it yu. If yu got debit cards yu could withdral the money. Now for the real stuff. Employees working for pos terminals moneris have hacked the device called the ingenico. They learned how to add a device in the machine that copies the data and the pin. A bluetooth device is added so it can be sent remotely. This is how the big.money is made. Yu need a dummy pad which is just a term for a random stolen pad it is only used to seem like the real one is still there. So heres how it goes. Yu walk into the store during.closing yu switch the pad with the dummy go home and get it chipped. Next morning yu go bacl and put it back.and take the dummy back. Because yu replaced it at night no1 even knows the real.one was gone. Now the altered pad is back in there collecting data. If yu happen to know the owner. Or employee who agree  URL_1  it you can just get it chipped nd put it in surprisingly alot of owners do this. Yu leave that pad in there for months it will collect over 2000 numbers. Yu dowbload it via bluetooth and password. Now yu need to get money. Hpwever banks started to cancel cards from a batch if yu ran the cards one by one. Meaning yu withdrew money from card 1 out of 2000. Then take the 2nd card out of 2000 then withdrawl etc etc. Banks would catch on after reports.of 30 cards frauded then they could track that all 30 ppl used they card at canadian tire on dundas and the whole file would die.

That's what depression is like, but the hunger is - [I've had a number of people take umbrage with my usage of \"sadness.\" Even though I suffer from it myself, I find sadness, more than other perhaps more technically accurate terms, helps best explain the sort of *weight* of the illness. But out of fairness, I've expanded the metaphor to more accurately describe the way it manifests at least for me, personally, which hopefully both people who suffer from depression and those who do not can find a deeper truth in] -hopelessness, lethargy, despair: a gravitational black hole in the core of you that swallows up everything you take into it - all the love from people around you, all the achievements and accomplishments and accolades, all the fun and joy and parties and friendships, *everything* - and leaves you will this impossibly dense, cold, dead star inside you, and just as that dead star sucks in everything around you, so too does it pull *you* in, stronger and stronger, and every single day is a battle just to stay UP, to resist being dragged down into the blackness that is self-annihilation, self-obliteration, until eventually you find yourself wondering *why* you're resisting, why you're bothering, because the only thing you're fighting for is day after day of that cold nothingness with no visible respite. You can't even *see* over the event horizon; its gravity is so powerful it bends the light at the end of the tunnel, convinces you that your future is oblivion, obscures your ability to envision any future where this endlessly hungry dead thing is *not* the core of you. And it hurts - it hurts *physically*, because without hope, without a positive vision of the future, your brain will slowly stop pumping out dopamine and endorphins, all the hormones that wash away life's little aches and pains and bothers, because your brain has *no justification* to try and make life better; the dead star in you has eaten your aspirations, your dreams and ambitions, and your brain shrugs and gives up dispensing with the typical pharmaceuticals that get us up and out and running and jumping all around; you're tired, and you're in pain, and everything you eat, everything you do is like sawdust in your mouth, bland and purposeless, and at that point it doesn't matter who you are - a fifteen year old kid, a married mother of three, or even Robin Fucking Williams, who had more money and fame and talent and success and global admiration than almost anyone else on the planet - literally none of it matters, because there's no amount of *matter* that will ever satiate a black hole; and at that point it becomes a true testament to the strength of the human condition, when you look at depression not a question of *why do people who are depressed become suicidal*, but rather, *how do so many people with depression hold out their fight for so god damn long in the face of such and overwhelming antagonist*? Depression is, at its core, a recurring pattern of negativity. Think of it like a loop. You brain is constantly reinforcing negativity. It doesn't matter if the events of the day are good or bad; your mind, separate of your conscious will, sends negative thoughts; self-loathing thoughts, hopeless thoughts, etc. This becomes a feedback loop that reinforces helplessness - you know spending time with loved ones is *supposed* to make you happy, but instead you feel nothing, or it makes you feel tired, or terrible. The fact that these positive things did not make you *feel* positive, in turn, makes you feel worse. Imagine, to return to the food metaphor, if eating not only did not satiate you, but made you *hungrier*. You would begin to associate food - normally the thing used to alleviate hunger - with the hunger itself, and begin to avoid it, and would likely feel helpless and frustrated that the *normal* course of action to dealing with hunger, eating, only made you feel worse. This frustration and helplessness would lead to more negativity, and so on. When we think of something being \"hard\", in life, be it sickness or other challenges, we use our *minds* to overcome it. We persevere, we find hope, we find happiness. This is the human condition. This is why depression is so insidious. It takes away the very thing that people usually use to find strength. Your happiness, your loves, your *reasons* - depression robs you of these things. It strips you of your ability to find joy and beauty in them. Depression makes everything, every moment of every day, a challenge, with no real respite. Just a constant feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and purposelessness. There are many theorized reasons for depression - hormonal imbalances, neurotransmitter defects, diet. But regardless of the root cause, it almost always manifests itself as a feedback loop of bad thoughts. Your brain gets \"stuck\" in a loop of thinking, where no matter what conscious thoughts you generate, you always get sucked back down into a cycle of negativity, sadness, and depression. This is one reason that psychologists are starting to seriously look at hallucinogenics as a possible treatment for depression: because they have a sort of dissociative effect; they can \"break\" this loop and elevate thought above or outside of it. It is almost impossible to see outside of the loop while you're *in* it, but gaining the perspective offered by something like LSD can have a profound effect in \"teaching\" the brain how it can escape cyclical thought patterns in favor of more beneficial thought patterns."}]}

I dislike sharing the idea because it can be very easily misconstrued as racist, but in reality it makes sense based on the history and time frames involved in human evolution. First, consider that other primates do not have long penises, but rather larger testicles for producing more semen. This occurs in many species, but please, read the piece here about Primates. [Primate Balls]( URL_0 ) Hopefully you see the power of sperm competition in mating systems, which means you understand the testicle size now. But since your question is regarding penis length, read this interesting factoid. [Penis Shape]( URL_1 ) (Summary incase title didn't make sense: Our penis shape scoops out semen from the vagina. Note: Do not use this as birth control) As mating patterns changed, sexual and natural pressures on the size of testicles changes. Depending on the type of the culture and mating patterns (we are talking WAY before any form of civilized society, pre-history, and thus not-reflective of anything existing today), a size and shape race developed that would result in modern shaped penises. This is further evidenced by the fact our sexual duration is much longer than other primates. The more we thrust, the more already present semen we remove from the vagina, and thus we increase the likelihood of our semen (which is moderate in volume because of decreased testicle size) being the victorious semen. Ultimately, bigger penises with a specific shape would be more successful in high sexual competition areas, and have no disadvantage in purely pair-bonded situations. Therefore it would selected for over time. As cultures developed and penis size no longer because a necessary factor in mating, the genes were not selected for or against, and they persisted to present day. **TL:DR** **Sword fights**"}]}

In reality, most films can't single out any one individual to blame as virtually every Hollywood scale film is made by committee. A screenwriter's story may go through a meat grinder of development notes prior to even having a director attached. Then more notes. Then an actor may get attached. Then more notes. Then the director has a brilliant vision, but the actor wants more money so the production design budget is cut in half. Then the shooting schedule is plagued by that typhoon nobody saw coming (production manager's fault) and the cinematographer, keen to try out a new camera system, loses a day's footage, demoralizing the crew. Then the editor presents the director's brilliant, three-hour rough cut, which the studio whittles down to a ninety minute incomprehensible plot. Then the marketing department has notes...

That's why cars don't explode or get horrible damage in say Gran Turismo or Forza. But it gets more complicated, like anything, you need the permission of the original creator of something to use it in your game/movie/song/etc. So not only will you be paying a company for use of the image of 'car' you have to agree to abide by their usage rules, which is where the exploding part comes in.

As the Declaration of Independence says:  > We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words:  > It is obvious to all of us that every human being is born equal, and that all of us are born with certain fundamental rights that cannot be taken away; some, but certainly not all, of these rights are the right to be alive, the right to be free, and the right to choose how to live your life. The Constitution does not give us our human rights -- they're granted to us upon birth by God, or the universe, or fate, or whatever you believe to be the source of fundamental truth. Everyone has these rights. American or foreign, bad people, good people, your worst enemy. Saints, criminals, murderers -- everyone is born with fundamental rights and they *cannot be taken away* by human beings, because who are we to remove a gift bestowed by God? Because these rights are inherent, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights don't provide them; rather, the documents provide *prohibitions on the government* from infringing on the exercise of these fundamental rights we are all born with. The Founders believed that the best government would be one that honored and protected its citizens natural rights. Now, some infringement of our rights is necessary to provide for social welfare and order, but even here, it's more about balancing the exercise of our rights; e.g., when you deny a criminal his right to freedom in order to protect other people's right to live free of physical harm. These rights are distinct in the Constitution from the Privileges  &  Immunities of citizenship, which *are* the things that we are granted as Americans. These include things like the entitlement to vote, to travel freely between states, and to have free access to commercial markets. These privileges *are* granted by the government and *can* be taken away. The Constitution recognizes the right to bear arms as a fundamental right. So, yes, illegal immigrants have that fundamental right -- they were born with it, just as you are. However, as I said, the Founders and the Constitution recognize that complete anarchy leads to greater infringement on human rights (because the strongest just takes over as tyrant), so the government is allowed enact reasonable regulations that infringe on fundamental rights to the extent that they are necessary to protect social order and welfare. One of the infringements that's reasonable is prohibiting noncitizens from owning firearms -- it is reasonable for a nation to protect itself by preventing armed foreigners from roaming free within its borders."}]}

{"id": "3veqe4", "input": "How did Switzerland stay out of WWII?", "output": [{"answer": "History, Tax evasion/money laundering, and compliance. Anyone telling you 'switzerland has a history of well armed defence' hasn't paid much attention to swiss history. The last major war they were involved in, the napoleonic wars, both sides over the course of 7 wars moved armies back and forth through switzlerland without much thought. Yet Switzerland remained independent after. The Swiss could have maybe mustered half a million soldiers to defend themselves in WW2, even in mountain passes they would have been doomed, out numberd 4 or 5 to one from all sides, and they had no capacity to produce their own air power or defences, so the Axis powers could have simply bombed them into starvation (eventually) if they couldn't be bothered mopping up. Switzerland produces no fuel of it's own, and only about half of it's own food. Who needs to invade when you can simply cut them off and wait for them to surrender? Sweden remained neutral as well, and they were equally encircled by nazi forces. They had iron, the nazi's wanted iron, the swedes sold it to them. Switzerland though has a history of being an independent entity within the holy roman empire (as all of the various principalities and kingdoms were). The Nazi's felt as the new Holy Roman Empire that they'd force them into the fold eventually, but that it wasn't pressing to do so immediately. During the unification of germany a number of southern german states remained separate from the main prussian confederation that went on to form germany about 5 years later. So this independence wasn't unprecedented, and many in the axis hierarchy anticipated another anchaluss like happened to austria, there were after all lots of nazi sympathizers in the swiss ranks. Which then leads us back to the two key factors. Tax evasion and compliance. Switzerland has historically been surrounded by 4 (later 3) great powers. Rich influential and important people in all of those places use Switzerland as a method to evade taxes in their own country, and the Nazi state used Switzerland as a place to basically launder looted gold. Lots of important people were quite happy to maintain the status quo because they got something they wanted from the Swiss for the time being. That flow of money allowed, for example, the germans to get access to money to buy things from Portugal, who would otherwise not have had much use for German Reich Marks was important to the Axis. Lastly - compliance. Switzerland played an important role in the war both for intelligence and as a meeting place between both sides. The allies and axis could (secretly of course) negotiate various agreements, about prisoners, bombings etc. Basically if I have a million of your prisoners and you have a million of mine, we need a neutral party to make sure those people are being treated fairly and to send them mail etc. (Hence the Red Cross based on the swiss flag). And lets not forget, lots of important Nazi's fled after the war. In part using their swiss bank accounts. Once there was a hint this whole taking over europe plan was going to go tits up they wanted a backup plan. And that backup plan needed to be hidden from the Gestapo."}]}
{"id": "1trusk", "input": "The \"crack epidemic\" of the 80s/90s and the alleged CIA or US government involvement.", "output": [{"answer": "Here's an ex LA cop that was in the CIA talking about it. (CIA embeds agents in major police departments)  URL_0  Can you explain some of the political adventures or misadventures that brought the CIA to the public eye around drug dealing? Well, if you go back historically, the Agency has been real active in Central America since the Second World War. I mean, the Agency was down there, even before it was CIA, with United Fruit and all the major landowners in Central America. In 1979, Anastasio Samosa, the dictator of Nicaragua, was overthrown by the Sandino movement--the Sandinistas. They were a \"Marxist\" movement, and Ronald Reagan mobilised the country to stave off this alleged threat of communist imperialism on America's doorstep. It was a whole lot of rubric and Congress didn't really want to get involved in it deeply. Congress passed some amendments to the Military Appropriations Act. They were known as the Boland Amendments, and were passed first I think in 1981 and again in 1984; they were Boland 1 and 2, which limited direct military aid to the Contras, the people fighting the Sandinistas. And so the CIA and Ronald Reagan and Bill Casey and George Bush (Vice President George Bush) were running the whole operation; we know that now. They circumvented the will of Congress and there was this explosion of drug trafficking all throughout Central America, coordinated by the CIA. And we now have the CIA's own documents, and I can show you one later. It's the CIA's Volume 2 of their own Inspector-General's Report from 1998 where, in its own words, the Agency admits that of the 58 known Contra groups, 58 were involved with drugs. And that the Agency dealt with them; it protected six traffickers, kept them out of jail. One guy moving four tons of cocaine a month was using a bank account opened by White House staffer Oliver North. Other CIA assets were caught moving 200 kilos at a time--200 kilos is not personal use--and he was saying, \"Well, I can't tell you what I'm doing because I'm doing it for the National Security Council\"--that's the White House organ that oversees the Central Intelligence Agency. So we saw this huge explosion. The point I make in my lectures is that in the mid- to late '70s, we in America--those of us who are old enough to remember--dealt with cartels but we didn't deal with drug cartels, we dealt with oil cartels. We had an oil crisis and it almost crippled the American economy. We had been subsidised by very cheap oil that we acquired by, in a sense, exploiting other countries. Well, then we had cartels of cocaine and we went from 40 to 50 metric tons a year to 600 metric tons a year. And that money was moved through Wall Street and became, in effect, the capital that replaced oil in the US economy."}]}
{"id": "33q9n5", "input": "How did Detroit become the undesirable city that it is now?", "output": [{"answer": "This has been answered, quite well, previously here so I will repost /u/iheartbbq's comment seen [here]( URL_1 ). From their post: I keep this around for just such an occasion: * Detroit is founded in 1701 as a trading outpost on the edge of the Detroit River, first main terminus on the westward expansion. * Detroit rises in power as a logging hub, the vast deciduous and northern coniferous forest are leveled and shipped by boat back east, creating the original fortunes of the city. * The late 1800s saw a growing city often called the Paris of the West. Major building projects began in the city's hub and rail lines were routed to Detroit from the east through Canada and out to Chicago. The lumber barons were investing in real estate and the architecture of the time reflects magnificently. The hub and spoke road system is adopted, but crucially is not rigidly adhered to. Main line roads radiate from the downtown hub, but secondary roundabouts and opposite diagonals are not constructed. * At the turn of the century, the auto industry explodes. Albert Kahn creates an architectural model still in use today that allows for rapid construction of space-efficient factories. Factories are built almost as fast as they can be. At this point, Detroit begins installing a street car system on its main line roads. Henry Ford establishes the $5 day. Ford is viciously anti-union and rumblings of union formation at the time are knocked down by Ford's generous pay levels. Word spreads and poor black southerners begin moving to Detroit in droves. The city housing stock explodes to accommodate this new population and vast tracts of land become identical row houses all built in the 1910-20 era. * The first section of roadway is paved with concrete in Detroit on the Woodward corridor. As poorly maintained and expensive brick and dirt roads give way to durable concrete roads, more people begin using cars and the auto industry continues expansion. * Prohibition hits Detroit hard. The city's proximity to Canada encourages illicit importation of alcohol and a vast underground of speakeasies. Organized crime takes hold in Detroit and the City government becomes corrupted. Government culture shifts towards bribery and intimidation. * By the start of WWII, Detroit is economically the most powerful city in the country. Its companies are making money on both cars and foreign military equipment contracts. When the US enters the war, all manufacturers are retasked to produce \"the arsenal of Democracy\" tanks, planes, military trucks, etc roll out of Detroit's factories and while many other cities suffer under rations, Detroit profits. Due to the draft, many of the factory workers are at war and although 2.5M African Americans registered for the draft, a maximum of 700,000 were declared fit and served at any given time. Due to the economic opportunity in the factories, even more African Americans moved to Detroit. Following the war, the imbalance in certain government contracts meant some companies had advanced technology relevant to consumer markets while others did not. Ford and General Motors benefited greatly with technologies applicable to passenger cars while Packard and Chrysler struggled after receiving mostly airplane-related contracts. Returning GIs found a city with an increasingly black racial makeup and racial tensions began escalating. * By the 1950s Detroit was at the height of its population with 1.8M, but violence became endemic owing to racism and government corruption. By this time the Teamsters, UAW and various Gangsters had staggering political influence and were bending the laws to the benefit of labor and detriment of business. The Eisenhower Freeway System comes to Detroit and slices the city to shreds. The highly inefficient hub-and-spoke road system means regular cross-city transit is very slow. The freeway system is routed indiscriminately through poor and immigrant neighborhoods. Whole neighborhoods are demolished or cut in two, fragmenting the entrenched communities. It is very obvious that rich cities are carefully routed around. This sows deep seeds of resentment amongst poorer Detroiters. The completed freeway system allows for living in outlying towns formerly too far for a practical commute. Automobile ownership soars and ridership on the street cars plummets, by 1956 the street car lines are closed. 180,000 Detroiters have left by 1960. Chrysler issues major layoffs in 1961. Packard goes out of business and the mile long Packard Plant closes. * It's a hot summer day in 1967. A police raid on an illegal bar escalates to police brutality and African American retaliation. The incident was the match that lit the fuse on a powder keg. Five days of rioting left the city decimated. 43 dead, 1189 injured, more than 7000 arrests, and more than 2000 buildings destroyed. The riots were viewed by whites as a sign of things to come and what had been a slow stream of whites leaving the city for the suburbs exploded to a flood. White flight was in full effect. By 1980 470,000 Detroiters have left. * The Coleman Young era is a city descending into madness. Rapid depletion of the city population, an incredibly inept and corrupt government, and the rise of crack cocaine as the street drug of choice lead to extreme violence. Although the police force is up, the police are not much better than the criminals. Young is known to have had shady dealings with a great number of organizations, but no police organization will investigate him. It is during this era that massive projects are undertaken to attempt city revitalization. The Renaissance Center, People Mover and Joe Louis Arena included. One of the most controversial was the completion of the Poletown Plant, a GM plant built after the mayor evicted a large portion of neighborhood and razed it. Considerable city funds were directed away from fundamentals and towards these ends. The effects of these large projects were fragmentation of neighborhoods and bad blood between residents and the government-business partnerships. In 1989, the iconic Michigan Central Station closes. A city income tax on residents, workers, and businesses is established to supplement dropping property tax revenues. * 1994, the North American Free Trade Act passes. Ross Perot's prediction is correct and the biggest [sucking sound]( URL_0 ) in the country is centered right over Detroit. The auto industry races to set up \"maquiladora\" along the border of Mexico. These towns are little more than dusty villages but in five years they'd be filled with factories churning out subassemblies with zero value added tax or tariffs imposed. Local suppliers and large specialized sub-assembly plants in Detroit begin closing, labor rates in Mexico under $2 an hour which puts American workers out of competition. The same model will be applied when China woos manufacturers in the 2000s, but their ~75 cent labor rates are even more enticing. (*thanks for the section suggestion [u/y2knole]( URL_2 )*) * By the late 90s projects to restore downtown begin. Massive sporting arenas (Ford Field and Comerica park) are constructed while neighborhoods continue being hollowed out. The renovation of downtown continues through the early 2000s and defunct neighborhoods such as Brush Park and Corktown are being purchased by speculators. The city government is heavily in debt, however in 2003 it's not running deficits. As the city enters the new millennium, its population is below 1M for the first time since the 1920s * The housing and banking crisis cripples the city. Rising property values plummet and speculators and developers pull out. The city pushes on with ambitious riverfront projects hoping to lure citizens downtown. Automakers and suppliers lay off thousands and the city's revenue disintegrates. Jefferson North plant closes. Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is indicted on corruption charges. The police force is sliced down and police respond primarily to violent crime calls only. A series of police commissioners are fired following corruption investigations. * Mayor Dave Bing is elected and his straight-talking, no baloney style chafes city council. The new mayor proposes bold plans to bring the city finances in line with its receipts, including closing down sections of the city and relocating population, selling or leasing Belle Isle, and restructuring the city charter. All are shot down following political infighting. Downtown development has been successful and the downtown district is now a major entertainment location. Investors are buying and renovating major downtown structures formerly vacant. Some downtown neighborhoods are at 100% occupancy, however this effect is concentrated and vast stretches remain vacant and essentially urban prairie. Jefferson North plant re-opens and GM invests heavily in the nearby Hamtramck plant. Special economic zones such as TechTown are centers of innovation. Outlying neighborhoods slowly disintegrate and scrapping rages out of control. Vacant homes in these areas are stripped of plumbing, HVAC, and wiring within days of becoming empty, rendering them essentially useless for market sale. The population is below 700,000 in spite of urban renewal in concentrated areas. * The Governor of the state declares the city in a financial emergency and appoints Kevyn Orr as emergency financial manager, effectively rendering Detroit's elected government impotent. Orr analyzes the city finances and offers a 10 year budget plan the council accepts (although primarily a ceremonial vote). Orr files bankruptcy proceedings, which are currently being adjudicated."}]}

The reason that 100% humidity would not mean water everywhere is due to the fact that the percentage you are referring to only suggests the amount of water the air can hold. For example, when it's hot outside air expands meaning their is more room between air particles which means more water can fill into the gaps. However when it is cold outside the air particles are very condensed which means there is not much room for water to build up. That's why you get dry skin in the winter. To sum it up: The humidity percentage only refers to the amount of water the air can hold. When there is 100 percent humidity it doesn't mean that the air has suddenly been replaced with water it just means the the air is holding more water. Hope this helps.

You're talking to a friend and telling them a funny story but you can't remember someone's name, every detail crystal clear except a name. These are similar to what can happen to people with various forms of dementia, and/or Alzheimer's. Sometimes the issues include depression and instead of remembering happy \"dreams\" it's like you have a nightmare and all you can focus on is scary, negative things. Early on, you know things aren't right. But you're old and forgetfulness is ok because people expect it. As it progresses, you are aware you are missing periods of time. It's like you had a daydream but don't remember your thoughts. Sometimes it lasts for a couple of minutes. With my grandmother it would last days. And it terrified her. She'd get mad about it. If you tried to finish a story for her because she clearly was \"stuck\" she'd get pissed. Embarrassed. She knew she was declining. She was pissed we put morning checklist in the bathroom. Brush your teeth. Wash your face. Lotion on your skin. If we didn't, she'd forget. Eventually she forgot the list was for her. She'd forget to groom. She knew she was supposed to go to the bathroom but not what to do. She'd shit on the floor next to the toilet. Then she forgot the bathroom was a thing and she'd piss off the side of the bed. By then she was \"gone\" and didn't know she was missing a thing."}]}
{"id": "4l34di", "input": "Why do Depression and Anxiety often occur together?", "output": [{"answer": "There is indeed a substantial co-occurrence of major depression and various anxiety disorders; while it's inevitably difficult to get accurate numbers, some estimates put it above 50%, with GAD and panic disorder leading. In one of the largest antidepressant trials which didn't try to select for \"pure\" depression, anxious depression was the norm. Why is a much more difficult question, because the root causes of major depression and anxiety disorders are fundamentally not known. Every serious source in the psychiatric literature stresses what we don't know; while there's always someone out there who will give you a clean and intuitive answer about magic brain chemicals, they really shouldn't. Besides, these are clinical diagnoses, which makes it hard to know whether what we're seeing on the surface correlates with one or more underlying issues; imagine trying to figure out the cause of pneumonia without microscopes or the concept of germs. That said, as I once heard it explained, \"we now know a lot more about what we don't know.\" One simple explanation is that they share many risk factors, both genetic and environmental. Another line of research concerns the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is tremendously important in the stress response, and implicated to some extent in most psychiatric problems.

If they do not have them they usually have speakers on stage directed at them. The problem with performing a music piece is that you do not hear how the music sounds when you are in the middle of it. The normal speakers are pointed towards the public and sound moves quite slow though the air. So you might perform a guitar solo on one side of the stage and hit every beat as you hear the bass guitar on the other side of the stage and it sounds perfect to you. However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system. Before sound systems small bands used to stand much closer together on the stage and look at each other rather then out to the public. Bigger orchestra would have a director in front or even among the public who could direct them using movement."}]}

The first thing to realize is that the charity is all about \"raising awareness.\" Breast Cancer is already very treatable, so simply detecting it early is an important part of helping minimize the effect of the disease. The organization gets flack for not putting most of their budget towards finding a cure but that's because highly effective treatments already exist. The organization does pay its executives an abnormally high salary. The organization is remarkably corporate\u2014they're well known for their \"for the cure\" and pink ribbon trademarks and they defend those trademarks with the full force of the law. They make a lot of their money off of letting other big corporations use these trademarks to look more charitable\u2014you get brands like Yoplait painting their products pink as a marketing strategy, encouraging people to buy those products over their competitors with the justification that some amount of the purchase price goes to help fight breast cancer (which is true, but it's typically only a few cents per product). As with all organizations some of the money they receive goes towards raising more money. It's easy to knee-jerk react to this that they are evil for doing this, but if you take in $1,000,000 and can spend $200,000 of that in advertising to bring in $400,000 then you can then use that $1,200,000 on research, awareness, etc. Presumably the organization wouldn't be spending so much on fund raising if it wasn't showing a positive return. Charity Navigator, which is usually pretty fair about these things, [gives SKG For The Cure a high 2-star rating out of four]( URL_0 ). They score very well on their transparency and accountability, while they score pretty mediocre on their use of funds. They do note that 80.4% of the funds are used for \"program expenses\" (i.e. the things that the charity is supposed to support); this is pretty reasonable, all told.

{"id": "1iy6fe", "input": "\"Television static is radiation left over from the big bang\"", "output": [{"answer": "Back when the universe was first born, it was like a hot, stretchy sticky goo (like the stuff you get to throw at windows and stuff). Somewhere in that blob of goo was the starting point of the energy that would make the solar system. The blob expanded, stretching the goo in all directions. As it stretched thinner, pieces began to clump together into smaller particles, and these particles clumped together into stars and dust and and eventually the solar system formed and, some time later, human life evolved on Earth. Now go back in time to that initial ball of goo and imagine another point at some distance away from the future-Earth point. As the goo stretched from the size of a singularity to the size it is now, that point became further and further away from us, so that some of the stuff might have been stretched so far away that the light travelling from it towards us may not even have reached us yet. Your TV aerial works by picking up light - albeit invisible light (also called Electromagnetic radiation). Your TV is designed to read electromagnetic signals that are arranged in a certain way so that they can be understood as pictures and sound by the TV. Imagine that the radiation from the distant point in space we were just talking about finally hits your TV aerial. The TV does its job to convert it back into sounds and pictures, but because that ancient radiation was not designed to be understandable by a TV, it makes no sense and the TV shows a blip of colour and a dash of noise. Now imagine instead of just one point in that original ball of goo, we were able to pick up radiation from every point in that ball of goo. The radiation would all be arriving at your TV aerial at different times, because of the different points in the goo-ball getting stretched apart from each other. The result is a constant stream of blips of colour and noise. Scientists have sent special satellites into space to go around the sun just like Earth does. These satellites are a long way away from Earth so that they aren't around TV stations, satellites and mobile phones, which all make lots of radiation. Because it is so quiet where they are, the scientists can use lots of aerials together as a special kind of telescope - a radio telescope - which is able to tell them the direction and energy level of each background radiation particle they detect. In doing this, scientists are able to make a map of space that is almost like viewing the early ball of goo from inside a time machine. This helps us better understand where people and planets and stars came from, as well as making white noise on our TV's."}]}

It's very different than say, your credit card debt in that the 'sovereign' is also the one who prints the currency. Let's say your weekly paycheck is $500. You only spend $400 this week. No big deal - you just leave it in the bank. However, if you're a 'sovereign' issuing currency, you can't just leave it in the bank - that would cause currency-crushing deflation. You *have* to spend that money somehow. Unfortunately, there's no direct link between revenues and expenditures. There's no way to predict when you collect the revenues how much you'll spend. Given that you'll crush your economy if you spend too little, you have to set revenue far enough below tax receipts that you never risk spending too little. The solution is sovereign debt - borrowing against future tax receipts to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditures. A side benefit of this system is that it gives investors a place to park their money. Without sovereign debt, you'd need to put your money in private securities - which are much, much riskier."}]}

One I'd like to add is that when you're watching TV episodes back-to-back like that, you're most likely already invested in it. You know the characters, you know the plot, so you can just jump right in and enjoy the show. No set-up is necessary. Plus there's that motivation of wanting to know what happens next. With a movie, you're going to have to meet the characters, learn about their situations and their motivations, and possibly learn about their world too. And since you don't know the characters yet, you don't really yearn to see them again and see what's going to happen to them next. And you're just comparing movies to television. If you get more specific and compare watching a tv show you're already sucked into, and watching a tv show you haven't started yet, the difference becomes more clear. I know I have plenty of tv shows I haven't started waiting in my Netflix and HBOGo queues. The way I put off *starting* a tv show is similar to the way I put off watching a movie."}]}

{"id": "54wbpn", "input": "Why do humans have fetishes?", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of the answers in this thread are trying to explain or rationalize *specific* fetishes, but I think OP's question is more general in nature. First, a point of clarification: the word \"fetish\" in common language essentially means \"a sexual attraction or fixation on body parts, objects, or activities not normally associated with sex.\" It's essentially when a person can be particularly sexually aroused by something that isn't typically considered to be arousing. Psychologists have not yet agreed upon a single explanation for why people form fetishes in the first place, but a common explanation involves (accidental) positive feedback loop of classical conditioning on the part of the fetishist. Under the right conditions, somebody who might *weakly* associate a non-sexual stimulus with sex will be able to get arousal out of it, which only further strengthens the association and the arousal that can be gained. Let's say that you're a straight guy with pretty vanilla sexual tastes. You're browsing porn on the internet, when all of a sudden you come across a video featuring a girl wearing a cat ear headband. At this point, you don't have a particular fixation with this sort of thing, but it doesn't turn you off either, and the girl is cute, so you like the video anyway. Meanwhile, your brain is picking up on the cat ears as something \"new,\" and novelty is a *big* factor in your brain's reward system, so when you finish, you've formed a slight association between \"girl wearing cat ears\" and \"getting your rocks off.\" Fast forward in time a bit to another porn session, and you come across *another* video with a girl wearing cat ears. The reward center in your brain remembers the last one, and is going \"yeah, this was good last time, I like this one too.\" The situation repeats, and strengthens the association between catgirls and sexual pleasure. Repeat this process enough times, and you'll get to the point where you *actively seek* porn with catgirls in it, and maybe you even *require* it to get it up. There won't be a rational reason for you to like this sort of thing, you just *do*, because you've inadvertently trained yourself to like it. EDIT: Alright, a lot of you are asking the same questions, and I don't have the time to respond to all of you, so I'm just going to put this shit up top. * The core thing to keep in mind is that this is all about *arousal*, which is distinct from *pleasure*. Yes, they often go hand-in-hand, but \"arousal\" is basically another word for \"excitement,\" and has meanings that go beyond *sexual* arousal. Anything that excites you, that gets your blood pumping, that gives you a tiny rush of adrenaline and endorphins, can be be considered \"arousing.\" Yes, a lap dance can do that, but so can being threatened with a knife, or being tied down, or being humiliated, or whatever. The associations we make with arousing stimuli depend enormously on the context and timing that we experience them with. If a nonsexual-but-still-arousing stimulus is presented with a sexual stimulus or context, then sexual association can begin to form around that nonsexual cue. * It's *entirely* possible that fetishes might have their origins before somebody reaches puberty. Like I said, \"arousal\" is just \"excitement,\" and is hard-wired into us even more deeply than sex. Understanding of sex and sexual maturity are not requirements for people to be influenced by outside sources. The example I cited with porn is just an *example*, and there's no reason why the same mechanism can't happen earlier in life, and completely by accident. Just because you recognized something as a childhood fetish in retrospect doesn't mean that it didn't form similarly to how I described. I'm betting that, whether you realized it was sexual or not, you sought out *more* of that thing because it made you feel good, and fell into the same cycle of reinforcement that I've described. Mind you, I'm not judging here, just explaining. * Homosexuality is *not* considered to be a fetish by the mainstream psychological community, so stop citing it as examples of an \"innate fetish\" or whatnot. It doesn't disprove anything, because you're comparing apples and oranges. However, if you want to talk about *transgenderism*, the field is much less settled on this matter, despite what people on tumblr might say. I'd recommend reading [The Man Who Would be Queen]( URL_0 ), which is a book that ignores all of the politically-correct bullshit around identity politics and actually examines it as a scientific phenomenon without trying to judge the fuck out of everybody involved. I had the good fortune to take a course taught by the author, and I swear to god I have never met a person who was as committed to taking an *objective* look at human sexuality as he is."}]}

Lithium ion batteries are classified as dangerous goods (UN Class 9) and so are [identified as dangerous air cargo (DAC) by the International Air Transport Authority (IATA)]( URL_1 ), but they are most safe when attached to the piece of equipment they are designed for. Transporting lithium batteries as freight requires them to be packed in a specific way to reduce the risk of fire or explosion (terminals taped, double bagged and in a tri-wall box IIRC). Basic information on DAC is also provided by airlines when you make your booking and you will see signs at check-in desks to remind you not to put DAC in your luggage. Restrictions on liquids stem directly from a plot to attack [trans-Atlantic flights with liquid explosives in 2006]( URL_0 ). At the time I was working at an airfield in Iraq and had to deal with the kerfuffle as security regulations were rapidly adapted to cope with an unforeseen threat. The 100ml limit is a compromise between the quantity of explosives required for a viable IED and the need for passengers to carry something on the flight. Finally adaptations to electronics can be detected by the x-ray machines you put your carry on luggage through or which scan your hold luggage. There is a reason why you put laptops, tablets etc through the scanner on their own: so that the machine and operator can get an unobstructed view of the insides in order to spot any anomalies. Finally swabs can be taken (and are taken at random) to detect for traces of explosives which is why it is unwise for military personnel to use their bergens or kit bags for travelling! Detectors are also used to screen hold luggage. Ultimately aviation security is a balancing act between efficacy and safety. There is no point running a perfectly safe system if it is unusable, but you cannot be unsafe. **TL;DR: the security measures are not a sham, nor are they exclusively designed to fuck you about and over-charge you for toiletries and water. All of the checks carried out at airports are done for a purpose and are based on a careful assessment of the risk.**"}]}

Realistically we would only send women and carry stored semen for the men.

Also in the event that some of the crew is lost it would be a terrible thing if by happenstance all the women were killed. Considering we currently lack the ability to develop a child in an artificial womb that would mean the failure of the mission, so to maximize the allowable loss of crew every crew member should have a womb. Considering varied semen is much more compact than taking male colonists it shouldn't be any trouble at all to send excess genetic diversity for any proposed colony. Of course this implies that every colony would by its nature develop a matriarchal society as the founding members who are the most educated and skilled would all be women, and the first few generations would likely be purely women as well.

{"id": "7sx7eq", "input": "In ancient and medieval times, how did soldiers distinguish friend from foe in battle?", "output": [{"answer": "Battles used to be quite smaller in medieval times. Smaller units like viking raiders were small enough that everyone knew the face of everyone else on their side. These are people who travel together and live in the same camp together so they would be able to recognize each other, even if they did not remember everyones name. Just remember back to when you went to school with 3-400 other kids and would still be able to recognize people from your school if for example two schools were at the same sports event. This is the scale of most battles. Bigger battles were fought between mostly between different empires. So you would be able to tell people apart based on their gear. A polish knight would have a different style of armor then a french knight. There were times throughout history when you would be able to gather enough men from similar regions to have a big battle. But this does require a lot of organization as you need to convince people though money or politics to take part in your war. It is easy to get people to the battlefield when the mongols or the crusades comes and invade your country, however it is much harder to summon people to the battlefield when the neighboring town stole your bucket. When you have an organized wealthy society that can manage such armies you would be able to equip your soldiers with some sort of uniform. Not all soldiers in an army would get the same uniform as they were often belonging to different mercenaries or independent lords. However remembering a few banners is much easier then a few thousand faces. The people under each banner were also kept away from each other for the most part. But there are a lot of stories of friendly fires in medieval battles. Soldiers had a hard time recognizing allies in big battles and sometimes mistook their uniforms or banners. One such famous example happened in one of the battles in the war of the roses when a cavalry flanking charge were successful at driving an enemy to panic into opposing infantry forces. But this maneuver send the cavalry charging head on into friendly forces who did not recognize their banners. It was also not that uncommon for soldiers to stop and see if someone they did not know were a friend or foe would attack or not, sometimes even asking them directly. The movie Braveheart uses this as an element a few times and demonstrates how such confusion can happen in the heat of battle and how it can be resolved."}]}

In the middle ages in Europe, life was hard. If you and your wife were commoners, it was very likely that more than half of any kids you brought into the world would die before giving you grandchildren. But what happens when you're 'lucky' and have five sons survive to adulthood, and the family farm can only support one or two of them? One path was apprenticeship, essentially selling the kid into indentured servitude in exchange for them having a paying trade at the end. Okay, that gets rid of one or two of them. But now you have Fred over here who has no talent in farming or a trade. You've spent a bunch of money to get him to breeding age and you're not going to get anything back from this. If you were a noble or something, you could send your kid into religious 'officer's school' to be a priest or bishop or something, but that option isn't open for poor Fred, either. Enter: monasticism. Basically, you can sell your kid to the Catholic Church, not for money, but for Heaven Credits (tm). We send useless Fred off to go be a monk at a monastery somewhere where he can earn money for the Church by toiling in some way or another (or providing some sort of administrative role) and spend the rest of the time praying for you and your wife's immortal soul. He doesn't get the prestige of being a priest who gets up in front of people and runs church, but there is at least a little status bump for having a kid be a monk, and you don't have to look at all those pox scars on his face all the time to remind you of all the food you could have saved if you had drowned him in the bathtub. But not all monasteries could sit off in the mountains and make beer for the Church to sell, or the bottom would just fall out of the market. So they diversified into doing shit that Church leaders really didn't want to do themselves. Some became those guys you can pay to sit in line for you on Black Friday, like the Carmelites squatting in what's now Israel so all those other filthy groups who wanted Israel couldn't live there. But it's kind of sandy and boring there, so nobody else wanted that job. Some became actual soldiers for god, like the Dominicans, who were brought together because the Cathars were Catholic'ing wrong and needed to have their heads rearranged by sharp bits of metal. Some went on biohazard duty, like the Franciscans tending to lepers. I mean sure, Jesus mentioned being nice to lepers, but those fuckers had communicable diseases! Some went out to be salespeople of Catholicism to the heathens like the Jesuits, because who really wants to go to foreign lands where they don't even have half-decent liquor and convince all these idiots to give your church their allegiance? That's not to say that's what all these groups do today. Today, the vast majority of religious orders do some great work for mankind. But you'd be surprised how many of them started with some priestly noble fuck not wanting to learn Native American languages or leave behind his comfy life in his family castle."}]}
{"id": "1tclod", "input": "what happens when a happy person takes antidepressants", "output": [{"answer": "Depends on the kind of antidepressant, of which there are many. SNRIs and SSRIs are probably the most common. They behave by inhibiting SERT, which is a membrane-bound protein which transports serotonin out of the synapse. In layman's terms, the drug increases levels of serotonin and, in the case of SNRIs, norepinephrine in the brain. Recent studies show the monoamine model of depression (i.e., that reduced serotonin levels cause depression) is wrong or unsupported, so no one knows *exactly* why these drugs work. The general theory these days is that they promote growth of new neurons in certain brain regions, which leads to a lessening of depressive symptoms. When a happy person takes these drugs, they may not experience any overt changes in their mood. They will likely just experience the side effects associated with elevated serotonin levels, including things like nausea, weight gain, dizziness, anorgasmia/sexual dysfunction, a \"flattening\" of mood or affect, etc. Other drugs will cause other effects. MAOIs work by inhibiting the enzymes that break down serotonin and other monoamines -- melatonin and other endogenous tryptamines. When a happy person takes MAOIs, they will have similar effects to SSRIs/SNRIs with the added side-effect profiles of having the *entire* spectrum of monoamines increased in their brains and bodies. Unique drugs like Mirtazapine are direct agonists/antagonists of certain serotonin, dopamine, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, meaning they don't necessarily derive their primary mode of action by increasing serotonin levels, but work by directly interacting with the receptors themselves in the brain. From experience, these kinds of drugs have more direct side effects, if that makes sense, including somnolence (mirtazapine and trazodone are used as sleep aids for this reason), increased appetite, strange/vivid dreams, and even odd things like increased erections in the case of trazodone. Basically, you will get the side effects of the drugs without the therapeutic benefit."}]}

However, it is well understood that people get addicted to cigarettes because it is a highly efficient nicotine delivery system, but they are killed by the other components in the cigarette. Many of the chemicals in smoke which are known to be harmful come specifically from the combustion. If you were to dry out some lettuce and smoke it, you would inhale many of the same carcinogens. Used properly, vaping does not burn anything - i.e. there is no combustion. However, it is possible to 'dry hit' a vape - such as when you forget to refill the tank. This causes the cotton to burn and therefore creates the same types of carcinogens to be produced as in cigarettes. Some studies of vape technology have reported very high levels of formaldehyde, specifically, but examining the materials and methods of these studies shows that they were almost certainly burning the cotton. Therefore, high levels of formaldehyde actually are a good litmus test for the validity of a study. If the levels are too high, they are likely studying older technology and using it improperly. This is not to say the scientists involved are incompetent or doing this deliberately, the technology has improved very significantly in the last few years. Public Health England [has concluded through scientific study]( URL_0 ) that vaping is about 95% less harmful than smoking. This does not mean that vaping is harmless, simply less harmful. What is **not** yet known is the long-term effects of vaping. The first e-cig was invented in 2003. There were only a handful of products on the market before the last few years. We have about a century of data on smoking and its long term effects. Is it possible that in fifty years we will learn that vaping was in fact more harmful in the long term? We cannot rule that out, but we have no reason to believe it will happen. However it is known that continuing to smoke will be harmful, so for people like me who have had no success quitting without vaping it is worth a try. We have a choice between something that will definitely kill us, or something that might but more likely won't. **TL,DR:** If you've never smoked, its probably not a good idea to start vaping. If you can quit smoking without vaping, quit smoking. However, many people have been unable to quit smoking without vaping, and reducing harm is better than continuing to smoke."}]}

So say you have a huge cloud of dust that will one day be a galaxy. At the moment it's a huge blob with particles flying in all directions and bumping into each other. If you add up the trajectories of all of the particles in that cloud, you will end up with a net amount of rotation on one axis (in 3D space), which means that the whole cloud is rotating in some direction on some 2D plane. Since the total amount of angular momentum in an isolated system has to stay the same, that means that the cloud must rotate no matter how the forces inside it end up balancing out. Particles that aren't rotating in that direction continue to bump into each other, as well as rotating particles, and over time, all of those opposing directional forces cancel out, leaving the cloud more or less all rotating in the same direction, on that same flat plane. The reason the disc doesn't collapse into a sphere is because the particles are individually too light relative to their distance between each other to overcome the centripetal forces keeping them locked in their orbits. Planets form spheres rather than discs because the particles that make them up, while starting as a cloud and collapsing into a disc, are able to pull together into clumps gravitationally. They still keep rotating in the same direction, but they all become larger chunks with enough mass to maintain a 3D shape against the speed of their rotation. This is also why all of the planets in most solar systems orbit in the same direction, because all of the particles that made them did so as well, and had nowhere to dump that rotation."}]}
{"id": "2mgx7d", "input": "Why German Engineering Is spoken of as being superior to many other countries?", "output": [{"answer": "I agree with many of the other points made in this thread, but I also think that there are a couple of other points. Firstly Germany is a Rhine economy which means that the Government takes a more active role in the economy - supporting, investing in, and subsidising key industries as they see fit and in accordance with a wider economic strategy. Anglo-saxon economies also pay out a lot in subsidy (more that their reputation for 'laissez-faire' might imply!) but it's more of a free-for-all. The advantage of the Rhine model for large industrial companies is that it creates economic stability so that they can invest and develop themselves long-term, and it reduces risk because they know that if there is trouble, the government will help them (and in many instances the government owns a big chunk of the business, so it's in their interest to step in, not only to protect the economy from lots of job-losses and additional benefits claims, but to protect the long-term revenues of the nation via dividends as well as taxes). Because they operate in a more stable, conservatively-run economy, instead of an extreme boom-and-bust cycle, and because they have the additional security of support from the government, these industrial companies can invest in R & D and the latest production methods and technology more easily - they may feel that they can afford to think long-term about expensive projects. Another issue is that historically many countries had similar reputations for excellence in engineering and manufacturing. Even the reputation of the British was once very good (and in some specialist areas such as space technology, it still is). However the British had a problem, and that problem was called oil. The discovery of oil in the North Sea forced the price of the pound up, because everyone wanted to buy oil from us, and needed to buy pounds in order to do so. This meant that the UK currency got relatively expensive, which meant that companies exporting goods from the UK found that their products were immediately more expensive than those of their international peers. The automotive industry, for instance, was destroyed, when previously we had exported respectable numbers of cars such as the Morris Minor to other countries."}]}

We already have mandatory checks in place for retail purchases that include, despite claims to the contrary from gun control people, purchases over the internet and gun shows. As it's been pointed out in the other comments, people are against the requirement to conduct a background check if you have a gun of your own that you'd like to sell. * **Including personal transfers in the background check requirement would stop more gun crimes** - The majority of gun crimes are committed either by people who have *illegally* obtained a gun by theft or by people who had a legal right to purchase a firearm, in which case, why would extending the reach of current checks to include personal sales have any impact on those legal purchases? * **Current background checks don't bar mentally unstable people from buying guns** (based on your comment) - Mentally unstable people are already barred from purchasing firearms. California is a prime example of what happens when you allow gun control politicians to have an unfettered ability to enact the gun control they desire. CA counties require you to [*prove* you have a pressing need for a concealed carry license]( URL_3 ). At one time, they required gun merchants to send a list of all gun purchasers to the state every month. [They imposed heavy restrictions on the purchase of ammunition]( URL_0 ). CA bans the sale of certain rifles that [use special features on magazines]( URL_2 ). The point is, the gun control politicians know they can't outrightly ban firearms so instead they make it as onerous as possible to own or obtain firearms, accessories, and ammunition. The rifle most gun control groups want to ban is the AR-15 even though handguns are the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Their reason for attacking the AR-15 seems to be that it *looks* military or scary, not that it's any more lethal than a handgun. Many groups even intentionally or unintentionally misstate that an AR-15 is capable of fully automatic fire. The accessories they try to ban have nothing to do with the lethality of the AR-15 ([barrel shrouds]( URL_1 ), pistol grips, and flash suppressors. So the argument that there's a \"gun show loophole\" is false. The argument that the majority of mass shootings occur because there is some flaw in the background check system is false. It's not that people are against mandatory checks, which is why there are in fact mandatory checks. Rather, it's that people object to gun control politicians from trying to make it onerous for legal purchasers to purchase or own something that they have a constitutional right to own."}]}
{"id": "3v8g5x", "input": "Why can't surgeons simply cut out the fat and excess skin or perform extreme liposuction to people that weigh 500+lbs?", "output": [{"answer": "Because this is an ELI5 and not a personal request for medical advice (one reason I think many doctors who see these threads and don't reply are concerned about) there are really four main factors, which some commenters have already mentioned. But if you want the real answer you're gonna have to put up with the TL version without DR. 1) Anaesthetic risk is even more risky. Sedating/paralysing/analgesing someone is a balance of many factors. Forgive the pun but obesity puts the balance out of whack. The easiest part of that to understand is that you physically have to keep the airway open against a person's body weight when they are entering/coming out of sedation(the machine does that in the middle), let alone the chemical/neurological aspects of keeping them safely \"under\". 2) Fat is a difficult tissue to work with. It is intricately connected to all its surrounding tissue, so even though you can separate it from the skin, it's something like how when you peel an orange the white pith always comes away with the segments. Plus fat is not even deposited in neat segments, it just looks that way because a lot of it will make up a layer, and, as others have mentioned, it also coats our internal organs for protection. There are blood vessels all through our fat. Even moreso than that, fat has an important hormonal role in the body, it is also a small source of stem cells, and performs other homeostatic functions (it's a buffer for chemicals and other nutrients we eat/store/release). 3) Big surgery is a big deal, like running a marathon on no training. Literally the most invasive intervention we have in medicine. Even small wounds cause lots of inflammation, and when you divert fluid en masse from one part of the body to another (wound) site, you get the fluid shifts everyone keeps mentioning. \"Lasering\" off the fat (cauterising, more like) still leaves charred unhappy tissue behind. And afterward, any surgery creates scar tissue - in a joint, in the abdominal cavity (sticky adhesions that can cause your bowels to twist on themselves and even cut circulation off) and yes, even track marks in fat. Any doctor will tell you the principles of treatment start with conservative (e.g. quitting smoking, dieting), then medical (nonsurgical interventions like medications or CPAP snoring machines) before surgical, with few exceptions such as broken bones. The media does not acurately reflect this decisionmaking process, which is done through talking WITH the patient, at all. But it is a cornerstone of good practice, one which makeover reality shows can decieve you does not exist. 4) Then, you have to recover from it. Some commenters have mentioned the psychological aspects of dramatic weight loss. It's more like, how would you deal with the probably dramatic body adaptations to sudden massive weight loss? People do not realise that plastic surgeons have a responsibility to leave a safe amount of fat on the body so that it continues to function as expected for the patient. Unlike amputation, which is obviously, very traumatic, and unlike small volume liposucton, the tissue loss you are asking about is not isolated. Plus the skin is our number 1 defensive barrier against infection, and now you go and compromise it all over. As I mentioned earlier, adipose (fat) plays a buffering role in the body, and the body continues to support the growth of adipose as well as form scar tissue wherever normal tissue integrity has been physically interrupted. The effect of sudden massive adipose loss has not been well studied, and in my honest medical opinion, it is not ethical to begin to do so at this time in history, despite those who I imagine will reply to tell me otherwise. A myriad of terrible complications are all theoretically probable from the surgery you are thinking of. So, it isn't a thing.

{"id": "45pa17", "input": "errr (ELI25): My math major roommate had an entire chapter on counting, senior year. I have a math minor. What did he learn about counting and fundamentals that I take for granted?", "output": [{"answer": "Their is a lot of bad information being given here. It's hard to tell from your description \"an entire chapter on counting\" what exactly your roommate is studying. Most likely your roommate is studying something called combinatorics which is a branch of math concerned with problems like \"How many objects of form X do we have with property Y?\" very often these objects are not numbers but other mathematical objects like graphs (( URL_0 ) or functions ( URL_1 ) and counting them is not as simple as \"adding them up\" like you would do with numbers. Counting in combinatorics is often the process of creating a function that generates one object for each possible object and then checking to see how many objects you can create with that function this is often the best approach to use even when working with objects that you might feasibly be able to count. For example a basic counting problem assigned to a first year student might looks something like \"How many four digit even numbers are there?\". You are more than welcome to go ahead and start writing them down by hand but I think that you would find the process more than a bit tedious. A better way to approach the problem might be see if there is some way to make a recipe to cook up four digit even numbers. First start with four blanks (one for each digit in out number) and try and see how many possibilities we have for each blank (_) (_) (_) (_). How many numbers can we have in the first blank? 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2 and 1 work but if we put a 0 in that place we have a three digit number so 0 is out but we have the numbers 1-9 so that's 9 possibilities (9) (_) (_) (_). How many possibility's for the second number do we have? Well 1-9 are still good and now zero is good because we ave something ahead of it so 10 same with the third digit. (9) (10) (10) (_). Well a number is even if and only if its last digit is a multiple of two so we get 0,2,4,6,8 which is 5 options so we get that to make a four digit even number. You first pick an integer between 1-9 and write that down in the first place then, you pick an integer between 0-9 and write that down in the second place, then you do the same for the first place, and for the last number you pick one of 0,2,4,6, or 8 and write that down in the last place for a total of 9x10x10x5= 4500 different combinations of numbers that make for a valid 4 digit even number. Alternatively you might recognize that their are 9x10x10x10 = 9000 four digit numbers and since half of them must be even 9000/2=4500 even 4 digit numbers. Obviously these problem get harder the more abstract the object that you are trying to count is or the weirder the restriction."}]}

Hence they have a massive amount of wealth concentrated to relatively few people, most of whom belong to the Al-Thani family. And, they like to splash that wealth in ways to bring attention to the country and increase their international influence and reputation. They have made several record-breaking art purchases over the past decade, but without any consistency. It's mostly haphazard without following any real theme.

They also sponsor several museums around the world, art shows, prizes etc -- all while there are museums in Doha (the capital city) closing down due to the lack of funds. It's not just art, Qatar is throwing money at anything that will bring media coverage to the country.

I think a skyscraper needs to have 40-50 floors, many apartments in Seoul have 25-30 floors so they're not \"technically\" skyscrapers, and more are constantly being built and under construction. The majority of the population in Seoul lives in these kind of apartments, even if they can't afford it traditionally. Most large companies in Korea (especially a company like Samsung) own several skyscrapers and these large apartment buildings, and they usually allow their employees to live there for free, or for a much cheaper price. Also, the Korean system of rent payment is much different. Basically, the more money you deposit, the cheaper the rent is. If you deposit, let's say, $100k (it might be more), you could live in one of these skyscrapers rent-free. When/if you move out, you get the money back. That $100k was taken by the company that owns the building and is invested. Since average people don't have $100k cash, they loan it from a bank, and then the bank gives it to the owner's of the building, and the tenants only have to pay small interest to the bank, it's like a mortgage, but better. When they move out, the bank gets their money back from the building; and the owner's of the building got their profit from the bank's investment. It's like a win-win-win, the owners of the building made a profit from the bank's deposit, the bank got interest from the tenant, and the tenant got to live in a skyscraper for dirt cheap. This is why average working class people *can* live in relatively luxurious skyscrapers in Korea, and that's why more are being built. In NYC, I have no idea. I assume people with careers can make enough to pay $3k rent, and most people living in cities like to live in nice places."}]}

If he sees someone openly carrying he is likely to approach the situation guarded and even with his gun drawn. So instead of dealing with the situation at hand the first reaction is hostile. It just doesn't set you up for success. Also, what if for some reason you match the description of someone they are looking for. For any amount of reasons. This has happened time and time again where people who fit the description of a wanted criminal are stopped and questions by police. If you are minding your own business walking down the street openly carrying and an leo notices you are openly carrying you will be treated as if you are the criminal until they can determine otherwise. The officer would likely draw his weapon, have you lay down, cuff you, and disarm you until the situation is resolved. If you are concealed carrying the officer would approach you calmly. You can inform them of your concealed carry, he will disarm you, and the interaction can continue peacefully. My biggest thing is that it is a big marker saying \"I have a gun\" and in many many situations you just don't want people knowing this.

Division is what is known as the inverse (mathematical opposite) of multiplication. Where multiplication can be thought of as combining many copies of something and counting the total; division is counting how many times you can remove a quantity from another until you can't remove any more. Saying six divided by two equals three is the same as asking how many times can I remove two things from a group of six things before I have no more things to remove. Three, of course. Division by zero is then the same as asking the question, \"How many times can I remove no (zero) objects from a collection of things before there are not enough things left for me to remove no more things? Looking at division as the inverse of multiplication I ask how many times I can add a bunch of things until I have a particular quantity.

This is what then eventually combined with some other projects to form MKULTRA after numerous other names and projects (ARTICHOKE, CASTIGATE, MKNAOMI, MKDELTA, etc.) The roots of the program were in drugs and interrogation -- but over the 20+ years that the program was in existence, it expanded well beyond that. Research into hypnotism (MKULTRA subproject 49, 84, others), brain concussions to erase memories (subproject 54), sensory deprivation (subproject 61), electric shock therapy (subproject 62), psychic driving by Ewen Cameron (subproject 68), neurotoxins and biological warfare (subproject 99, 101), study of adolescent gangs and social dynamics (subproject 102), children's summer camps (subproject 103), sabotage of petroleum resources (104), the infamous Witch Doctor Study by Dr. Raymond Prince at McGill Universtiy (subproject 121) the list goes on and on and on with more and more interesting subprojects. There are all documented, I haven't brought up any that can't be backed up by redacted documents on  URL_0  own website. TL;DR MKULTRA started off as research into drugs and torture as interrogation techniques, but it expanded into all things \"mind-control\" related. Implanting false memories, erasing memories, hypnotism, cultural dynamics, peer pressure -- if it had to do with influencing human behavior in isolation or groups, MKULTRA touched it."}]}

This pulls in and mixes with a lot ambient air (Venturi or Bornoulli effect)- in fact the air stream is only typically 40% body warmth and 60% ambient so it will be marked colder. As a experiment you pucker and blow threw a tube held to your mouth, this excludes the ambient air and you will get reduced airflow but at a higher tempeture again. But with a wide mouth there is hardly any air entertainment. It's tempeture will be almost the same as the air in your lungs wich is higher than the ambient air."}]}
{"id": "7z536z", "input": "How is an i7 processor faster than an i3 if the clock speed is almost the same?", "output": [{"answer": "**Short answer**: the difference is in how much your processor does in those clock cycles. **Long answer:** The amount of instructions your processor handles each second depends on two factors: * Clock speed: the speed at which the processor components switch state * Instructions per Clock cycle (IPC): the amount of instructions the processor can handle during one cycle. Clock speed has not improved that much over the last 5-10 years. A higher clock speed results in more heat, and we have hit a limit to how much we can comfortably cool. For desktops that's in between 3-4 GHz, for laptops that's even lower. Therefore lots of improvements have been made to the IPC. Mostly it comes down to parallellism: processing multiple instructions at the same time. If we compare processing instructions to doing the laundry: * Pipelining: instead of washing, drying, ironing the first load, then doing the same for the second, third, ... the second load can already start using the washing machine as soon as the first load is transfered to the dryer. * Instruction parallellism: if two loads of laundry require the same washing machine settings, we can put them together and execute in the same cycle. * Multiple processor cores: we use multiple washing machines, dryers, irons to wach multiple loads at the same time. * Multiple instruction threads per core: if a certain load does not need to be ironed, we can use the iron for another load. EDIT: * Most people seem to use the term \"IPC\" only to indicate single core performance, here I used it in the broader sense and do count multicore processors as an improvement in IPC. * Cache is indeed a factor I forgot. In laundry terms, cache is a set of racks where you can store a small amount of laundry. You can store laundry you just washed while it waits for the dryer to be free. Or if you have a load of blue shirts in the washing machine you can already prepare another load of blue shirts to follow so you don't have to switch settings."}]}

That usually signifies a partial dislocation of the joint, also known as subluxation. When it pops back into place, that's called a reduction of the joint. It hurts like hell when it's subluxed because the misaligment causes increased tension (straining) or tearing (spraining) of the ligaments connecting the two bone segments. When it's reduced, it feels better because the tension is relieved, but the strained/sprained ligaments can continue to be sore for a few weeks while they heal. Reducing the joint on your own is generally advised against because pulling on the finger can do more harm than good, e.g. turning a partial tear into a complete tear, which will then require surgery, and also because these injuries can often be accompanied by a fracture."}]}

Oil money is huge in the U.S. and with Canada, Texas, and Alaskan oil as well as an established refining and distribution network it doesn't make economic sense in the short term with oil so cheap. If the United States government NEEDED to get it done sooner it would; but there isn't the political and social pressure needed to serve as a catalyst to counter the inertia of so many powerful people with a vested interest in riding the oil cash cow as long as possible. Nuclear energy is also hugely unpopular, for reasons I don't really agree with but it means a huge part of that renewable energy pie is off limits for the most part. With recent blunders over seas, (fukushima etc.), the nuclear movement has all but come to a halt in the mainstream. Without a reliable form of Hydro-Electric or Geothermal NATIONWIDE (excluding the isolated locations) the united states is left with wind and solar. Both of which require massive investments to reach gigawatt levels of output which can't be relied upon completely. It's very complicated to design a grid with fall backs to maintain the necessary energy levels/freq/etc and variable levels of output only further complicate it. **TLDR: Bigger/Sparser/fossil fuels are the perfect energy source if you don't give a fuck about pollution and we can get plenty cheap.**"}]}

That seemed to be the whole story, and that the component particles of atoms were \"fundamental\" \u2014 they weren't made of anything else, they were just kind of themselves. But then we found out that **protons and neutrons are actually made of smaller particles**, which are called \"**quarks**\". Quarks have some interesting properties. It turns out that quarks have six different \"flavors\" -- just intrinsically different varieties. There are only a handful of stable combinations of flavors that will last when they clump together. Other combos break down quickly or never form at all. And most importantly and weirdly, they can't be separated \u2014 they can only exist in these combos. Particles made of combinations of quarks are called, as a family, \"**hadrons**\". The protons and neutrons we know so well from our daily lives are the most stable combination of quarks, which are made of just two flavors called \"up\" and \"down\" quarks. These are also the most stable flavors of quarks \u2014 other flavors quickly decay into up and downs. But there are also more exotic combinations of quarks that show up as relatively short-lived particles in cosmic rays and stuff. These can involve combinations of the other four flavors of quark: \"strange\", \"charm\", \"bottom\", and \"top\". Quarks and hadrons have a lot of other interesting properties and important roles in particle physics. But to everyday human experience, the combos of up and down quarks that we know as protons and neutrons are the biggest part of the picture."}]}

Why didn't we end up with like a blueberry or apple or banana fermented beverage as a cultural standard?", "output": [{"answer": "Grapevines produce an enormous amount of fruit, and it grows in bunches that are easy to harvest. Grapes are soft and easy to crush for juice. Once you have the juice, it ferments all by itself and you're drinking wine. Berries are a possibility, but you have to pick them one at a time. Blackberries and raspberries grow on thorny vines, in dense brambles. I've picked them both, and it's not a volume task. You'll get all scratched up and very weary picking a gallon of berries, and they're so tasty you'd be an idiot to crush them for a jug of hooch. Other berries, like strawberries, are mostly very recent additions to our crops. Apples produce abundantly, and are easy to pick, but getting the juice out of them is much harder than it is for grapes. A mechanical press of some sort is required. And they are the best bet of tree fruit. Stone fruits like peaches have the additional problem of a large, slightly poisonous seeds in the middle that you want to avoid crushing into the juice.

I deny the assumption that this is at the core of what makes it great. RHPS is a combination of camp, kitsch, musicals, and B-movie tribute. It takes a particular combination of tastes to LOVE it, and just a few to like it. I would say you'd need to fully enjoy / get it: 1. **It's intentional shlock.** aka [kitsch]( URL_0 ). It's meant to be tongue-in-cheek. You're supposed to laugh at the over-the-top sexuality, violence, melodrama, sociopathy, and poor production. If you just \"don't find it funny\", that's fine, let's move on to: 2. **Gender-bending as a genre**. [Gender-bending]( URL_9 ) is at least part of this film's genre, if you can call it that. There's something about gender-bending that appeals to a lot of people. Think of films like Hedwig and the Angry Inch, or musical artists like Prince, David Bowie, and Lady Gaga. For whatever reason, there's an appeal - and if this doesn't appeal to you, even as a curiosity, you're missing something. Okay - you don't like that, then there's always: 3. **It's a tribute to sci-fi B-movies**. This is pretty similar to #1, except that where the movie can be taken as shlock in its own right, Richard O'Brien specifically created this as a comedy tribute sci-fi B-movies. It's one reason why people like Mystery Science Theater 3000. You don't even have to be familiar with those old films to understand what they're trying to say about them. Dang, you don't like throwbacks? Well there's always: 4. **It's a musical with a great soundtrack**. The songs are very catchy and have stood the test of time. Most of them have tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but they're very catchy. The stage show is still running in theater houses around the world, even without the craziness of the full throwing-toast experience. Hm, you don't like the music either? There might not be much hope for you... at least there's always: 5. **It's a comedy**, and a pretty good one. Or at least, most RHPS fans laugh a lot throughout the film. Tim Curry's timing and physical comedy is great - that show pretty much launched his long and varied career. He actually started as the first Dr. Frank N. Furter in the original stage production in London, and he carried it through to the movie. Pretty much every character in the movie comes with laughs, and only Riff Raff takes himself completely seriously. Are you telling me you didn't even chuckle? Geez, I guess there's always the fact that: 6. **It has iconic imagery**. Obviously, it wouldn't be iconic if it wasn't so popular for other reasons -- but since it is, it has an unusually high # of distinctive images within it. Here are a few examples: a. Dr. Frank N Furter's [Outfit #1]( URL_3 ) and [Outfit #2]( URL_10 ) and [Outfit #3]( URL_4 ) b. [The Lips]( URL_1 ) c. [Frank's Sneers]( URL_7 ) d. [The kitsch logo]( URL_2 ) e.

It depends on your definition of random, but something pre-existing causes these blockages, ruptures, collapses. They aren't random in that sense.

{"id": "2cr00z", "input": "How is it that, say, Lebron James and Danny DeVito are considered to be the same species despite being so physically different, but a brown bear and a black bear are considered to be completely different species despite being so physically similar?", "output": [{"answer": "Defining species is a tricky and often subjective part of the various scientific disciplines which interact with it. Some will say that the viability of offspring among groups of sexually reproducing organisms is a good test, and it does offer some utility, but it is by no means exhaustive. Polar bears and grizzley bears are a famous example of two types of organisms which are generally considered different species, but which occasionally mate in wild, producing reproductively viable offspring. Mosquitos can become behaviorally different enough that they don't know how to entice mates between groups and they are often considered diferent species despite the reproductive viability of offspring created by human intervention. Archaeological evidence throws in additional wrinkles. Although we generally consider domesticated dogs to all be of the same species, if the only record we had of them were bones (ignoring DNA) we would likely consider great danes to be a completely different species from pugs. This problem rears its head when examining hominids which co-existed as it is difficult to say if these are divergent groups of one species or two separate species; some the scientists involved usually prefer the latter result as it is more prestigeous to discover a new species than just a member of an existing one. Non-sexual reproducers add additional problems as the detectable differences in species has a lot to do with how they look and how they behave around other similar organisms. DNA has added an additional tool which allows us to statistically compare gene differences between two organisms. This has been done to create base-lines of what we already feel are different species and how much their genetics deviate from each other and then we can use this to compare other similar appearing organisms, both those we can observe today and those from the relatively recent past. If they are too similar, it is a strong mark against it being a different species and if they are quite different, it is a strong mark in favor of it. In the end, the idea of 'species' is only important when it is useful in describing our world. It's useful to differentiate between predators and prey, or the reproductive viability of populations of organisms, or tracking forms of organism through the archaeological record. It is important to recognize that the walls we put up around species are not entirely sound and if we aren't careful we can make mistakes, but in so far that they are useful tools for helping us to grapple with the complexity of the world, they are just fine."}]}

{"id": "j2s6d", "input": "LI5: How do ones and zeros become complex computer games?", "output": [{"answer": "I hope I understand your question correctly. If I do I think no one's quite addressed it. I'm coming at this from the angle of \"What does it mean to say data on a computer drive is just 1's and 0's\" or perhaps \"How can a string of 1's and 0's actually be a computer program / game\". ----- Starting with something like a Turing machine: Imagine you have an old-school tape-recorder. So you have a long magnetic strip of tape, and a tape head which is sensitive to how the tape is magnetized (charged (1) or not (0)), and it can also write out onto the tape either 1 or zero. Being an electronics genius, you hook up a circuit to the tape recorder which does the following: * if the value under the tape is a 0 * move to the right one inch * write another 1 on the tape * if the value under the tape is a 1 * move to the left one inch * write another 1 on the tape If you set this going, it wouldn't be very exciting: The initial value would be zero, so the machine would go right, and write a 1, then the value under the head would be 1, so it'd go left and write a 1, then the value under the head would be 1, so it'd go left and write another 1 and so on forever. Let's say you make another circuit that does the same as the first one, but moves left instead of right when it sees a 0, and right instead of left when it sees a 1. Now you hook up both circuits to the tape-recorder, and you have a switch that allows you to toggle between them. So Lets say you modify the first circuit such that if the value it sees is a zero, it does what it did before, then switches to the second circuit. And you make the second circuit, if it sees a zero, switch back to the first circuit. Ok - so you could expand this principle, making additional circuits that write zero instead of 1, and move left instead of right, and so on depending on what's underneath the tape-head. And each time you'd be hard-coded to switch to a different circuit. Let's say you have (at least) 1 circuit where if it sees one symbol (a 1 say), it rings a bell and stops the machine to tell you it's done. Groovy. Now you could start out with some set of symbols on the tape (1,0,0,1) and depending on how your circuits were set up you'd end up hearing a bell ring, and if you looked at the tape you'd have some different set of symbols on it (1,1,0,0). Exactly what symbols you end up with would depend on how your circuits were configured, but you could (for example) have a setup which put all the 1's together at the beginning of the tape. This is actually the beginning of performing automatic calculations. For example if you took a base 10 number and represented it in binary (so 1 is 1, 2 is 10, 2 is 11, and so on), you could have circuits set up that would automatically increment by 1 (so 10 - >  11 or 11 - >  100, etc), or double, or add 2 numbers together, multiply by (an approximation of) pi, etc etc. and write the result out to the tape. Great - you've got a calculator. In the description so far, the tape contains raw input data (a number to double or whatever). However it's also actually telling the machine what to do (go left, go right, switch to circuit 'b', etc). So you could also think of it as containing a set of instructions being applied to the machine. In the case of adding 1 to the value: if I want to write out \"11\", I pass in \"10\". In fact, it could contain both -- for example - I could have a string of 1's and zero's that caused the machine to read the slot to the right of the string, and to the right of that, and write out the total in the two slots beyond that (Then stop and ring the bell!). This is actually a computer program, right? You've got some instructions and some raw data to perform the instructions on. Fast forward 90 years and circuits are miniaturized down to microchip size, information is written out to hard drives, and you of course are not ringing a bell and having to examine a tape to see what the results of a calculation are - instead you have hardware that responds to the instructions, displaying pixels on a screen, playing sound through speakers, etc., and of course you have a keyboard and mouse, which essentially are electronic switches picked up by the hardware and software to modify how the programs behave. And of course programs aren't written by hand in 1's and 0's. See the programming language discussion that everyone else is linking to for more on that!  URL_0  I hope this is somewhat helpful. Disclaimers: 1) I am a programmer but I write JavaScript and some Java so deal with no low level memory management stuff directly 2) My explanation is based on my somewhat hazy memories of computability classes from University which I really haven't used or revisited in 15 years, and a quick skim through the wikipedia entry on Turing machines.

These are felt and discarded almost immediately, if you even noted them at all. If you do notice them, it's something like an itch or a hair in your face, quickly gotten rid of, and not very memorable. The second is short-term memory. It's remembering someone's phone number until you get it in your phone, or the page you left off in a book. It's front and center in your mind for a little while, but it's not something you commit to the third type of memory. Long term. It's the name of your husband or wife, or your native tongue. You never forget. When deja-vu occurs, it's a some neurons messing up where they're supposed to go. Instead of just sensory information being discarded, it's getting rerouted to the short or long term memory. It makes everything feel as if it has happened before, even if it has not. It is a false experience of memories being recalled, because it wasn't in your other memories before your neurons shot wrong. There are two other occurrences like deva vu; jamais vu and presque vu. Jamais vu is like deja vu, except when you feel as if you remember something you're experiencing now with deja vu, jamais vu makes familiar things seem foreign. It's when you sit down in your car you've had for years and forget how to start it. Your brain is again misfiring and not making the connection that it should be.

I believe a lot of it stems from people who are irritated by the 'hippies who want handouts'. People usually also hold the view that they don't want their government turning into a 'nanny state' whose operations cost taxpayers extra money for its inflated bureaucracy leading to overhead costs due to the legislations made to create social welfare programs to help people, after all, the government doesn't do things as efficiently as the private, capitalist industry (/s). Lastly, [moral hazard]( URL_0 ) is a concept held closely by a lot of the intellectual anti-socialist crowd. Moral hazard is basically the idea that if you are insured from risk, you are more likely to act riskier. If your nanny state government insures you from going completely bankrupt by providing you food stamps and welfare checks, you are less likely to find a job that would help you climb out of your debts sooner. While I believe some of these talking points have important information to pull away from it, it just simply is a terribly cynical view of humanity. We don't live in a purely capitalist society right now, it operates based on 'socialist' regulations and we all drive on roads built from 'socialist' legislation. A true capitalist society means that power is achieved by capital, ie resources. And I don't see how this is any different from anarchy. In a stateless soceity, the people with the most resources will have the most influence. My biggest gripe against conservatives is the idea that social healthcare should 'never ever' be implemented because it's too expensive. It's as if they are reading this out of some bible, some rule of life. It's purely ideological. A basic, accountable form of social healthcare, one that conducts voluntary tests on its population to help prevent epidemics, is certainly a necessity. And I don't think leaving those types of responsibilities up to a deregulated/unregulated private industry who answers to shareholders first would be the best thing for society. Hence, some form of socialism is necessary for, well, our social health."}]}

{"id": "5d94do", "input": "why is the US the only country, apart from Liberia and Burma, not to have adopted the International System of units?", "output": [{"answer": "For most people, whatever measurement system they are familiar with, and is the one they are confident of using, is the one that is better. People who have learnt metric from an early age, will say metric is better, while people who have learnt Imperial or US Customary measures from an early age will say that Imperial or US Customary measures are better. However, if one is to take a neutral position, and analyses the metric system, and compare it to any other measurement system, them metric is undoubtably better. All counties use metric, although no country is totally metric. Metrication is advancing in all countries, including the US. It has been for at least 100 years, and it will continue to be learnt, understood, and used by more and more people throughout the world every year. It's popularity increases as people see the many advantages of the metric system. Why is the metric system easier, and better, than Imperial or USC? The most frequently given answers include: 1\u2026Because metric is simple and consistent. There is only one meter and one kilometer and one liter..Unlike the mile (3 miles, international mile, US Survey mile, nautical mile.) and two gallons (Imperial gallon and US gallon) metric is simple and less confusing, fewer errors, less cost. 2\u2026Because it dramatically reduces conversion factors in calculations. Less time doing calculations, fewer errors, less wastage in material and time, less cost. 3\u2026Because metric prefix\u2019s enable whole numbers only. Avoiding decimal fractions and missinteruptation and errors. 4\u2026Because metric offers units from very large to very small. 5\u2026Because metric dimensions are easier to divide by three. 6\u2026Because it has links between related measurements. 7\u2026Because it uses logical symbols. 8..Because it is the only properly maintained system. 9..Because practically everyone uses it. For more than 95% of the world population, the metric system is the customary system of units, and for more than half of the industrialized world, it has been for at least a century. 10..Because when one uses it, there is no need to use any other system of measurement, because it is a complete system of measurement, and everything in the known universe can be measured with it. Also I believe that the metric system is better than Imperial measures because.. The metric system is a system. The metric system is the only measurement method ever developed as a complete system. All previous attempts used random developments at different places, at different times, and for different purposes. The metric system is universal. The metric system has been gradually adopted by all of the world\u2019s people. Despite often-vigorous opposition, the metric system has always been successful. The metric system is coherent. Because the metric system was developed as a complete system, it was possible to design it so that it has an internal consistency. Its internal coherence means that if you learn one part of the metric system you can easily extend your knowledge to all other parts. The metric system is capable. All crafts, trades, and professions can successfully use the metric system. Although the structure of the metric system is quite simple, it can be used in every human activity. The metric system is equitable. The metric system is fair and just to all who use it. The metric system is simple. The metric system uses only 7 base units and 22 units with special names \u2014 29 units in all. There are now only 20 old measures left that are non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System. The metric system is supported. International treaties and research keep the metric system modern and forward looking. The metric system is fundamental. The metric system is the only system used internationally. It is now fundamental to all measurements, both old and new. The metric system is unique. The metric system is unique because: it was planned; it is decimal; it has prefixes; and it is human in scale. It is unique because there has never been a measuring system like it. The metric system is legal. Legislation in every country in the world supports the metric system. It is often the sole method of measurement recognised by governments. International agreements also support the metric system so that contracts written in metric units have validity across international borders. The US adopted the metric system, when it was made legal and official in 1866, with the Metric Act, the only measurement system to have an Act of Congress. The primary reason that it has never been universally accepted, is because its uptake is voluntary, whereas standard/USC is by default mandatory, and the first measurements learnt in schools, thereby resulting in metric to be mainly understood, through messy and unpopular conversions to standard/USC"}]}

It's nice when you lose that control from time to time. She just raped your face and you let her. Rape fantasies are just that. Take me and lose control. Grind me, need me, want me, they say. There's such a culture of men being unable to be raped, and women being so able to be raped, that rough CONSENSUAL rape play tends to be pretty one sided. When in reality, we as men don't even notice the power dynamic when it happens to us. It's all about power, and consensual play. Fantasy is the word you seem to be glossing over.

{"id": "5z61tp", "input": "A piano and a violin can play the same note but their sound differs; you can tell them apart. How do notes differ with each instrument, but retain the characteristics of its assigned pitch?", "output": [{"answer": "Let's ELI5 this! I see some nice answers that are WAY above ELI5, so let's make this simple here. You know what a pitch is -- it's a frequency. Basically, the air is vibrating so many times per second. For example, if it vibrates 440 times a second, we name that note A4. Just what we call it. It's the A above middle C on the piano, and it's the second highest string on the violin. If a sound wave is vibrating at 440 Hz, that is, 440 times per second, it's an A4. So OK, can you draw a wave on a piece of paper? It waves up and down like a snake, right? Well, one time going up and one time going down is one cycle. That's the bit that repeats. The main thing that makes different sounds sound different is that these waves have different shapes. Maybe instead of being like a snake, it goes straight up, over, straight down, over, straight up, over, etc. That's a square wave. Or maybe it goes in triangles, making a triangle wave. Each shape of wave makes a different sound. For example, if you sing \"ah\" or \"eh\" or \"ee\" or \"oh\" or \"oo\" or \"aw\" or \"uh\" or whatever, on the same note, each of those vowels will make a wave of a different shape. It'll still have the same number of cycles per second, but the cycle of the \"eh\" will look different from the cycle of the \"oo\". They'll probably be kind of weird curvy thingies, but they'll be *different* kind of weird curvy thingies. That's what makes the sound different... ...when you're holding it. Because there's other stuff too. When you *start* a sound or *end* a sound, different things can happen. For example, you can start the sound really hard, hitting it very loud for a very short time and then quickly going away to a normal volume. For example, if you say \"Dah\", with a hard D, you'll have a different start from if you say \"nah\" with a light n. These features at the start are called attack and decay; the attack is how long it takes to get to the loudest bit, then the decay is how long it takes to get to the regular volume. Then comes the end of the sound. The violin can just keep holding a note at constant volume for a long time, but you can't do that on piano; once you strike a key, the sound starts dying away slowly while you're holding the key down (you can make it stop quickly if you want by releasing the key). This behavior is called sustain. When you finally release the key, or when you stop bowing the note, there's a little bit of echo or some sort of sound when you stop; this is called the release. These four parameters, attack, decay, sustain, and release, are collectively known as the envelope of the sound. Different sounds have different envelopes too. But sounds don't have to be pure. There can be many different sounds that together make up one sound. For example, when you say \"Dah\", there's a \"D\" and there's an \"ah\". If you say \"Tah\" or \"nah\" or \"sah\", you'll have a different initial sound -- the consonant -- but the same vowel sound. The shape of the wave is in the vowel; the consonant is just what happens right at the beginning. In those cases, it's not usually a wave at a particular frequency; it's just a burst of energy, and that burst can have any shape at all and it doesn't have to repeat 440 times a second. Each shape makes a different sound. Sound is one thing and one thing only: air vibrating. The type of sound we hear is based entirely on the shape of the sound wave. Different sounds come from different shapes."}]}
{"id": "1qu285", "input": "What happens inside the body during diarrhea?", "output": [{"answer": "Background - When you eat food, your body immediately *adds* fluid to the food to help break it down. Since this is the case, the watery state found diarrhea can easily be found early on during digestion. Typically, by the time food and drink gets to the end of your colon, all of the water has been absorbed or reabsorbed by your body. Stool is always liquid at first as it passes through the body but normally the body is able to absorb lots of water before it is passed out of the body. If the transit time of the food/soon-to-be stool is quickened, this can cause diarrhea due to speed of transit - the colon takes a long time to reabsorb water. Water and Food - The body is a filter for nutrients. Anything that you swallow is assessed for it's ability to be used by the body. If the body can't use it (as is the case with non-digestible fiber found in celery) it is passed through and bulks stool, which is a good thing if you need to slow down the rate of stool output. Water intake will prevent constipation by hydrating fiber in your intestines but it won't increase the water content of your stools. This is only because your kidneys work *way* faster than your intestines do at *reabsorbing* water from the intestines/tubules in your kidneys. If you drink a lot of water, you pee it out quickly before it could cause diarrhea. If you were to drink lots of water frequently and consistently for an extended period of time, only then would you possibly be able increase the water content of your stool. Salt - As changheill said, diarrhea can often be caused by electrolyte imbalances, which direct the flow of water. **Water follows salt**. Though we typically think of table salt (NaCl) when we hear salt, in chemistry, a salt can be any set of charged molecules. This is exactly what happens when people take a salt-based laxative when they are constipated. Salty contents of the intestine (the laxative) *pull* water in to keep equilibrium (this means equal concentrations of everything, everywhere) between the body and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. For diarrhea to take place, there is some sort of imbalance in what you have eaten that has caused the stool to retain water. When it exits, it still has water. If anyone is interested, I'll be glad reformat/clarify my above response or answer more questions. **EDIT:** - Taco Bell Butt - Ah yes, the Taco Bell Butt Syndrome (TBBS)...this is actually caused not by electrolyte imbalances but instead by inflammation of the intestines. Much like cold weather, black pepper, or any variety of things can cause you to have a runny nose, spices can inflame your intestines, leading to \"runny nose gut syndrome\". All of your GI tract creates mucus (often called bowel sweat by GI doctors). TBBS is also due to heavy use of Sodium (salt) as a flavor enhancer. Something can also be said about the low fiber content of heavily processed foods such as one would find at Taco Bell. The more something is processed, the easier it is for your body to break it down on the chemical level and ingest it's nutrients - meaning quicker transit time through the GI, so fast that the body doesn't have time to reabsorb water from the colon before the exit of stool. As a side note, think of of celery. It is a low-calorie food because humans cannot break down the cellulose fibers - other animals can and, for them, celery is not a low-calorie *or* fiber-rich food...the fiber part of food is only the part that isn't digested. Celery is natural and full of fiber - everything Taco Bell is not. Taco Bell food has been chemically broken down, cooked, stirred, pounded, mashed, ground up, chemically treated again, spiced and seasoned - it's a Ferrari in your stomach. Salt (the need for equilibrium that drives water into the GI tract)**+**Spices that cause your stomach to have a runny nose**+**low residue foods that move too quickly through the GI tract**=**TBBS."}]}

When you join Google, you will most likely have come from a job where you were the big fish; the most technically skilled in your particular department or field. Even for such intelligent and highly skilled people, it can be an enormous shock to the system to go from an environment where you know everything required to do your job, and all the years of your expert industry knowledge were usually directly relevant your job, to then be employed by a highly prestigious company (perhaps Google is your dream job) where you're now a little fish in a big pond surrounded by thousands of people who are just as clever as you, where you find there is a steep learning curve and you're not immediately productive, and where most of the systems and softwares you are working on are unfamiliar so you cannot directly draw on your past job experience to let you coast by (you have to learn learn learn to do your new job).

{"id": "13lidw", "input": "- Why do airline ticket prices fluctuate so much on a day to day basis?", "output": [{"answer": "Yay it's finally my day to shine! I am an IBE (Internet Booking Engine) software developer working for one of the bigger international companies in the industry, I basically make the websites you go to buy your tickets. Here is my ELI5 explanation, if anyone has more detailed questions I'd be happy to answer them as well: There is a limited number of seats in an aircraft. The people working in the airline divide them into slices, like you would with a cake for example, and give a difference price to each slice. So for example if an aircraft has 200 seats, they will first divide them into something called \"cabin classes\", usually as first / business / economy. Seats in the first class slice of the cake have all the toppings and choco-chips and fruit pieces: They are very comfy, have big TV screens and get the best food. Business class is like that but with smaller seats and less fun, and economy class is just to get you through your flight (although you usually still get some food and a small TV). Since many people can't pay for first and business slices, the majority of the seats will be in the economy slice, may be like 8 / 16 / 176 for our 200 seats. Now that you have those 176 seats in a huge single slice, you notice that not everyone wants to eat the same amount of cake. Some people will just want a taste, and they don't want to pay for a big piece which they couldn't finish anyway. Other people are really in a hurry to eat some of the cake, so they would be willing to pay more to get a piece. So you further divide your big economy slice into \"reservation classes\" (also called by the fancy name of Reservation Booking Designators). Out of those 176 seats, you can say that 26 will be very cheap but don't get any food on the plane, some other 40 are reasonably priced but you have to pay for them at least one month before the flight, another 30 are very pricey but you can get them even in the last second and so on, so that everyone can get a piece of cake according to their money and their needs. When they buy such a slice, we say that they bought tickets. So let's say someone wants to buy one of those really cheap tickets. But there were only 26 of them to begin with, and people buy cheap tickets even if they are not sure they would be able to use them later, because hey they are cheap. So when you go to the airline website, it will tell you \"Nope, you can only get one of these more expensive tickets\". But 5 minutes after that, someone who bought a cheap ticket may decide he doesn't want it anymore and return it, so when you check back during the same day what you will see is that ticket prices dropped like crazy. Another thing is this: The airline wants to sell all slices of the cake, because they already paid for it and baked it. And if some slices are left, they will go to waste when the airplane lifts off with empty seats. So the people in the airline look at each flight, and if the slices are selling very well and just a few are left, they increase the price above normal because hey, people clearly want a piece of this cake, so someone will likely pay extra for the last pieces. But if there are a lot of empty seats left, they will lower the price below normal to lure more people in before the plane leaves the airport. Sorry for the long response, but this is a much more complicated issue than people realise and I happen to know way too much of it :) **TLDR: Airlines group seats together and assign different prices to them. Cheaper seats are fewer in number, so they go out of stock more easily. The airlines will also adjust these prices at the last minute based on how well the sales are doing. So when you check the prices for the same flight during the same day, you might see expensive (no cheap seats left), then super cheap (someone cancelled their reservation with a cheap seat), and then as the takeoff time approaches something even lower (there are a lot of empty seats left) or higher (very few seats remaining).**"}]}

The best way to simplify it is to say that we do not ALWAYS enter a burning structure. There are quite a few common sense reasons that are a definite no go for us (such as flames through the roof, indicating a high probability for collapse on most residential fires). If there is a possibility that we can enter the structure, the incident commander has to make a decision which comes down to \"risk a little to save a little, risk a lot to save a lot\". If there is any chance that a VIABLE human life is inside, you can guarantee that every firefighter on the scene would risk their life without question to save the person inside. The big word there being viable. Most of the time the toxic chemicals produced by modern manufacturing give off super heated and immediately deadly fumes that can kill you after only a few breaths. We have to take that into account and will not risk as much to recover someone who has without a doubt perished. Our next goal is to save property that can be saved. Family photos and heirlooms are irreplaceable and we make every effort to minimize your loss. If I can read the conditions of the fire and make a direct attack inside the house right at the seat of the fire, it extinguishes the fire quicker, preventing extension and also limiting damage from water being shot in through Windows. Most of our nozzles put out at least 200 gallons per minute. That is a lot if water to put inside your house blindly through a window. Most kitchen fires could probably be extinguished with less than 30 gallons if there is no extension into the walls/roof. Also as others have said, there are a lot of times you can't be certain that the building is unoccupied. A lot of accidental fires happen because squatters light \"camp fires\" in abandoned buildings to keep warm. They have a right to be saved and us not completing a search of the building (conditions permitting) would be negligent. In residential buildings we keep our eye out for indicators of people that would occupy the structure. For instance if there is a car in the driveway then someone was likely home. Or if there are small children's toys in the yard or house then we automatically assume the possibility that we need to account for children. Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile. Hope this helps answer your question. If you take anything away from this, just know that if there is a possibility for me or any of the firefighters I know to save a life, we will fight until our last breath to get you out safely.

This is not correct. Luckily we are not jpegs, and DNA replication is very accurate. DNA does not accumulate enough mutations (usually) fast enough to be a factor in aging. Aging has been linked to the length and presence of \"telomeres\". When a cell divides, and DNA replicates, the replication process (while fast and accurate) is unable to copy the end pieces of DNA. Because of this, DNA is capped with junk code at both ends. We refer to these as telomeres. So, every division results in a loss of some of these telomeres. When the telomeres run out, further divisions would result in losing valuable DNA code. Instead of doing this, cells will cease further division and die. To further complicate this, a thing called \"telomerase\" is responsible for replenishing telomeres. ~~As you get older, the telomerase replenishes less and less of your telomeres.~~ Telomerase is active during fetal cell replication, and in your balls where frequent rapid cell division occurs. In the rest of your body, dividing cells will whittle away at their available telomeres. This results in fewer new cells, and more frequent dying of cells. This onset of shortlived, dying cells is \"aging\" in the traditional sense. People with \"hyperactive\" telomerase tend to live longer. However, a careful balance of telomeres and telomerase is thought to be crucial in preventing cancerous growths."}]}
{"id": "ljjxn", "input": "Why American sport teams expect that the public should pay for their stadiums.", "output": [{"answer": "There are numerous reasons. The first is that the city will own the stadium, not the team. This means that the city has the power to lease the stadium out to any tenant for any purpose. Thus, the city can use that stadium for civic events pretty much rent-free (and subsidized by the sports team and other tenants). Also, they have some control over which other acts get booked: if they don't want, say, Lady Gaga coming to town, they have the ability to deny her the largest venue without overstepping their bounds. Additionally, it gives the city some leverage with the teams playing in it--the lease can be conditional upon the team keeping proper order and ensuring riots don't happen (though the team really can't stop anything that happens because of people watching at home). That's why the *city* wants to pay for the stadium. Sports teams want it because while they only use the stadium during a part of the year, they would still have to maintain it through the *whole* year. They would also have to pay taxes on it. The fact is that event-specific rent is a lot cheaper than just flat-out owning the stadium."}]}

They weren't good or fair, but if you played by the rules you could do alright. Post-Soviet Russia was the wild fuckin' west. It's why Russians approve so strongly of Putin. Him and United Russia have managed to reign in the worst of the corruption and crime and make the state functional again for a lot of people."}]}
{"id": "8zooqt", "input": "What would happen if a Nuclear Power Plant was left unattended?", "output": [{"answer": "Edit: TL;DR- not much. Well it depends on what type of reactor we are talking about. But let's assume it's simplified pressurized water reactor with a simplified steam plant attached. Now, the type of apocalyptic scenario will play some apply some key features. In all scenarios where there is one trained operator alive and functional, he will ensure the reactor is in a safe condition before abandoning. It will be ultimately recoverable and functional. There will be no contamination of anything in the surrounding environment for over 3000 years assuming all material requirements/inspections were above board during construction and maintenance. The internal metallic components (which are submerged in water) should have minimal corrosion for over 200 years assuming the system remains closed (a reasonable assumption) and will still be functional. We must in any \"interesting\" scenarios remove all operators from ensuring a safe and effective shutdown. **Let's first assume that the reactor and attached plant are simply abandoned in place and that the society around it for all intents and purposes ceases to exist.** The only loads to the steam system will be the power utilized by the plant itself (associated pumps, heating rods, indicators, ect). With no electric load the Steam System will fail to cool the reactor side water. The inlet temperature will rise which will cause lowering of thermal neutron density in the core. This means Reactor Power will lower to almost nothing. Excess heat generated by the Reactor will reach equilibrium with losses to ambient. Power will remain stable at  < 1%. Since no person is around to maintain rod height, temperature will lower in a compensatory fashion as more fuel is expended. Overall temperature of the plant will eventually reach a set point and the reactor will scram to prevent a cold water incursion. The reactor and associated plant will remain dormant essentially indefinitely until a trained team of operators commences with a properly executed startup procedure. **Now let's assume a non directed physical assault on the plant from an external source (i.e. earthquake, or if on a ship a collision). The operators are all incapacitated simultaneously.** Reactor control rods will immediately be driven to the bottom of the core. Reactor power will immediately reach the subcritical range (any fission events will not result in a chain reaction). For Plants with a fill system the pumps will fill the entire reactor compartment with water from a fill system. The plant will likely be damaged but contained. The containment features of any plant will make contamination spread highly unlikely (astronomically unlikely). The plant will likely be unrecoverable without significant maintenance if at all. **Final scenario is a directed attack whether internal or external to the plant. All operators are either incapacitated or directly working to sabotage the system safeties** One level of containment will be immediately lost. Trained saboteurs will likely attempt to create a cold water incursion as that is the most assured way to destroy primary containment. The problem is that this will immediately disengage irrecoverable safeties. The plant is completely irrecoverable at this point. Further containment will prevent spread of the system to the surrounding environment (barring sabotage). Dilution will rapidly occur as reactor fill systems kick in (barring sabotage). The water will be highly radioactive but localized and designed to stay inside the plant. A significant flooding event would be required to spread the contaminated water. Assuming a missile or other external strike. The reactor will scram. The strike will breach outer containment. No other layer of containment will likely be affected. The Reactor plant will be largely unaffected (and shutdown). Recovery of the Reactor plant will be possible, but the steam plant will need to be rebuilt."}]}

If you delve into the kind of magic that would be required to scale a human then many more problems arise. The retinal cells in our eyes just don't scale down like that. Insect cells are roughly the same size as human cells; they just have way fewer of them. That's partly why insects have compound eyes which work in a very different way from human eyes. The most fundamental problem is that the square-cube law means that you can't just scale cells or organisms and expect them to work in the same way.

{"id": "8cnbov", "input": "Classical music is still relevant es ever.

However it all depends what you mean by \u201cclassical\u201d. If you are referring to people composing in the style of the classical period then of course there isn\u2019t anyone famous doing that because music isn\u2019t static, it continues to change. However by saying \u201cclassical\u201d you mean high art music for a large professional musical ensembles then there are plenty of examples of contemporary composers of great renown. Others have already mentioned movie composers, I would contend musicals fall in that category as well. While some may regard them as \u201clow\u201d or \u201ccommercial\u201d in a few centuries we will look at them in the same way we look at the works of Shakespeare (I know he is not a composer but he was the best example I could think of for someone who\u2019s craft was actually quite raunchy and accessible to the masses who now is considered the epitome of high culture). Even among composers who write for other musicians there are \u201crockstars\u201d like Eric Whiteaker who enjoy some degree of mainstream success. Will a composer in this day and age ever be as famous as a pop star? Probably not. But I suspect that the reason history remembers classical composers has a lot less to do with how popular they were during their lifetime and a lot more to with how well their works were documented and talked about by their patrons (usually the rich and the powerful). I would guess that like pop music, the music of the people, folk music, has always been more popular, but until the printing press and recording studio became widely accessible to the masses there was no way of easily documenting and distributing the work of any one artist or band to a wider audience."}]}
{"id": "6m4neu", "input": "How point systems, like on Snapchat and Reddit, motivate people to participate even though they contribute no tangible value like money or rewards?", "output": [{"answer": "Note: I don't have a Snapchat, So I'll be speaking from a Reddit perspective. Disclaimer: There are so many other niches and elements of the system that I didn't touch on, simply because I didn't know about it, didn't think about it, didn't have time to mention it, or any other number of reasons. This post is just a surface scratch of why the upvote and downvote system works. Human psychology is an incredibly deep and vague subject of which I don't have nearly the credentials to really claim to know what's true and what's not. Part of it is purely because it indicates social acceptance. If someone likes your post, they upvote it. And social acceptance, if functioning correctly, should make you subconsciously feel a little good. It's built into human nature, otherwise we wouldn't be social animals. Another part of it is because it makes the system tangible and measurable, which commonly makes things more appealing to humans, as opposed to vague or entirely indeterminate measurement systems. Imagine if you wrote some blog post on some blog site: would you want it to have an indicator that simply says \"This post is doing well!\" with an image of a small fire next to it (and nothing at all if it does poorly), or a counter of how many views it's had? It's generally more fun to see it go from some number like 1,100 when you go to sleep, and wake up to 2,310. Even better if it suddenly made it big somehow and jumped from 1.5k to 300k overnight. Being quantifiable simply makes things feel more controllable, or at least observable. As to motivation to upvote someone else's content: A common reason is to show appreciation because it was better than the average post or comment. Maybe it made you giggle, or they provided some extremely in-depth answer, or they're a novelty account that does its job well. In any case, showing appreciation is like an honest \"Thank you\", and makes both parties feel good on the inside. Another common reason is to help sort out what's good and bad content. If it's ad-spam; downvote and report. If it's some fan art of something you like, or a funny post, or an interesting video, you upvote it to help others see it, and also to help a post that you like get the attention that you think it deserves. As for comments, it's the same way. When sorted by \"hot\" or \"best\", AskReddit threads almost always sort themselves out into really good comments at the top, and mediocre comments at the bottom, save for the exception when an answer is late to the party and ends up sitting at 1 karma. That sense of helping a fellow human out also triggers that feelgood sensation, because again, if being positively social benefits the species, then it's a good system for the brain to reward. ^^1 I forgot to talk about the case in which downvotes affect the user experience. Basically, it's the \"negative feedback\" response. So, like it seems, you downvote content that you don't like, be it because it doesn't contribute, because it might be factually wrong, because you don't think someone should see it, or because you disagree with it. In some of these cases--where you downvote because of the appropriate reasons--it ties back around to the feeling of contributing to society, which makes you feel like a necessary cog in the social machine. After all, you did your part in making that out-of-place NSFL shock link or extremely aggressive and rude comment more invisible from the eyes of the rest of the community. You've cleaned out part of the trash. In the other cases--in which you downvote because you disagree--it provides a *different* rewarding feeling, albeit more self-aligned. It might make you feel superior. It might make you feel like you're \"more right\" for having more karma on your post. In a very heated Reddit debate, there might be one side which is consistently negative in karma, whereas the other side is consistently positive in karma (usually due to the audience which is viewing it). The side which is positive feels like they have a group behind them, whereas the other party is a solo individual who doesn't stand a chance, and might be completely wrong. In turn, you once again feel like you've aligned with society, and get rewarded for it. --------- TL;DR it feels good to upvote content, and receive upvotes in turn. This TLDR doesn't help much. You should read the full comment. ---------- Edit: two comments have explicitly told me about their upvotes. It feels good. Let me express an honest thank you in return. This makes me even happier. (In case another example is needed, refer to this edit.) Edit 2: an insightful comment from /u/MNGrrl has prompted me to add another section to my comment---though not necessarily directly related to their comment, but rather a tangent of it which I failed to mention.

A wedding (holy or not) by itself is not a legal marriage without a lawfully issued marriage certificate. And in some cases, even that might not be enough. For example, if you lawfully execute a second marriage in another state or county (because the first one would catch on before issuing you the license), that's *bigamy,* and the first result is that the second marriage is automatically annulled.

The other part is that maybe you just don't know how to photograph well. Models, actors, and other camera personalities actually work to learn their angles.

One of my best angles is one shoulder to the front, slightly down, with my head tilted a little bit down. In real life it looks (and feels) awkward. On camera I look like a badass. There are some good general rules for this (standing side on with your arm pressed against your side makes your arm look fat. Duck face for better cheekbones. bend over a little to show some cleavage. That kind of stuff), but it is mostly individual. Best thing to do is to actually experiment with it... set your camera up on a tripod (or better yet, get a portrait photographer for a couple of hours!), and try to copy the face and body positions from a few magazine shoots of celebrities you think you look like, or just ones that you think look good.

Even through high school, things are taught in a very black and white / binary way, so trying to get people to understand why he felt violence had acceptable applications or why he didn't completely oppose segregation is really difficult without spending a LOT of time on the subject and its context, and similarly if you go too in-depth on just his views (e.g. reading his autobiography to kids at a very young age), it can be difficult to explain why these views may also be detrimental. I have two quick examples regarding this: 1) Based on the one paragraph about Marcus Garvey in my high school US history book, nobody understood why he promoted segregation and everybody thought he was terrible, and 2) We read \"A Modest Proposal\" in my sophomore year of high school, and I kid you not, I was possibly the only one in the class of 30+ that recognized it as satire (it's possible more did and just didn't speak up, but the majority of the class thought the whole thing was barbaric and were disgusted by it)."}]}

Sometimes it's used to mean a malevolent or misguided deity, others just to refer to a sort of genuine mystical public servant, sort of a architect or accountant for the universe. The myth I heard goes like this, and if memory serves belongs before genesis time-wise: There's this divine reality, comprised of a sort of divine family. The thing at the top (a 'true' god sort of thing) spawned some of the 'family' (some male, some female), and the rest of the family spawned other members with the grace and guidance/permission of the head divine god-critter. One of these members decided to spawn a new member of the family without grace and guidance from the big divinity on top. Her name is Sophia, and this conception goes horribly wrong. After creating this sort of divine abortion/abomination, she stares at it and realizes she fucked up big. In shame, she covers it with a sort of cloud/haze before it comes to and awakes. When it awakes, it sees nothing but itself. Being of divine origin, it's certainly powerful and, so far as it is concerned, all powerful. Spotting no cause other than itself, it assumes it's the causeless cause (in actuality this is the big divine head honcho) because if nothing exists but it, what else could it be? In ignorance, it creates a host of servants (angels), these servants help it build a world. On this world, he and his servants create creatures to worship and love him. But the spark that lets him create doesn't come from him, and his misuse produces beings that inevitably flee the cages he builds for them. There's a number of failed worlds he builds, starting flowy and spirity and slowly coalescing over each failed model into the existing world in front of us today. Additionally, this story comes with a modified version of genesis: Sophia, realizing she fucked up big and that pieces of her own divine essence are getting misused by her bastard son (the demiurge), tries to repent and fix her mistakes. An extra woman shows up in eden named lilith. One who defies the demiurge and leaves after it demands she submit to Adam by invoking the name of the actual god. The actual god also makes an appearance at one point, terrifying the demiurge; but the demiurge stays in denial about it's place in things and continues to believe it must be in charge of all; even trying to snatch at and steal the power of that head honcho god for itself.

Financial regulators constantly monitor these reports to make sure that the bank has enough assets to cope with an unexpected financial event. If a bank were to simply add a few billion dollars to it's accounting records, the discrepancy from one balance sheet to the next would show that this money was simply invented and the bank would be fined or (hopefully) be shut down by the regulators. Also, every dollar in the bank's accounts has to be shown to have originated from a source and those sources are also required to show a corresponding transaction. For banks, this may be other banks, government treasuries, business, profit from interest charged, profit from financial trades, or from public savings accounts.

Basically, because people want more stuff. Say people are twice as productive today than they were 30 years ago. If people wanted the same standard of living as 30 years ago they could work half as much. But people want twice the standard of living as 30 years ago, so people work the same amount. [Also keep in mind that the number of hours worked per year in the US has been trending down for a long time,]( URL_2 ) so to some extent people don't still have to work 40 hours per week. So to answer this one, people don't have to work 40 hours a week, but people want the lifestyle that working 40 hours a week provides.  >  Why are real wages still stagnant? Well there's a few reasons. When looking at why average wages haven't kept up with productivity, [a lot of the evidence points to the idea the increases in productivity are being eaten by non-monetary compensation]( URL_1 ). Mostly in the form of rising healthcare costs. Another reason is rising Inequality, and not in the sense of between the 99% and the 1%. Yes inequality has risen in between the 1% and everything else, but the real, major rise in inequality has been between those with a college education and those without. To quote David Autor, director of MIT's inequality initiative [\"The earnings gap between the median college-educated two-income family and the median high school-educated two-income family ... is four times as large as the redistribution that has taken place from the bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent of households in the same period\"]( URL_0 ) This rising inequality is believed to be driven primarily by technological change. Think about it - workers have gotten massively more productive since the 1970s, but that productivity increase doesn't apply to all workers. Are Janitors or Cashiers really any more productive than they were 30 years ago? And if not, why would we expect to see them paid any more? In addition, a lot of the jobs that increased in productivity also came bundled with an increase in the amount of skill required to do those jobs. Something that previously could be done by anyone with a high school diploma now requires years of specialized training. A similar share of the labor market consisting of unskilled workers is competing for a smaller share of the labor market, and that leaves wages stagnant or even lower for them. All of this leads to a fairly rosy picture for most college graduates (recent college graduates are stuck at a point in there lives where they are paying off the expenses of college before the full income benefits of college are realized, which typically doesn't happen until mid 30's early 40's), but a dismal picture for high school graduates or dropouts. Then on top of that you have more regional issues. For example, because of zoning and space restrictions, the cost of housing has dramatically increased in coastal cities. Finally to top everything off, you have some statistical quirks which make things look a bit worse than they are. For example, because the average household size has been shrinking for quite a while, you are less likely today to have multiple earners in a household than you were in the past (pop culture greatly exaggerated the prevalence of single income families in the past)"}]}

Nowadays, almost all data transfer is made through fiber optic cables or terrestrial radio links (antennas that point to each other at small distances), simply because of the amount of time it takes for the signal to reach a satellite and arrive back to Earth is too much for satellites to be useful at phone calls, video conferences, playing online games and so on. Large datacenters (places where there are lots of computers connected to several internet providers at the same time) sometimes also have large antenna dishes aimed at some satellites they have contracts with. In case there is an emergency where the datacenter loses one or several land based connections, the owners of those computers can connect through the satellite and retrieve their data. If you're really interested, there's a very long but insightful article on Wired about how one of those very long ocean cables ws put in the ocean and what's involved in doing something like this:  URL_0  The author was on one of those boats that layed the cables on the ocean floor and talked to a lot of people so it's quite informative. As you can see from reading that article, things could be so much simpler and better for the whole world, if religion and politics didn't exist (or didn't play such a big role in people's lives) :( But on the happier side, it's amazing to see how many technical difficulties can be solved and how much work there actually is in moving data around the world."}]}

What you talk about in these meetings depends on the type of role you have. My days as an employee of a large insurance company with 30,000+ employees are dramatically different than they were when I was a real estate appraiser in a 2-person office. I expect when you're asking about generic \"business jobs\" - you're thinking more along the lines of what I do now (the big insurance company). Being in such a big company, even the smallest changes require coordination between a lot of different areas. Everyone has different goals and report to different leaders. So you spend a lot of your time in meetings, on teleconferences, and sending emails to coordinate so that everyone has the same expectations and knows what they need to do. For example, I recently worked on a a project where we needed to send a new form along with the insurance policy. The form should be completed by the insured, then sent back to us. Things we have to coordinate: * designing the form * getting approval from lawyers that the form accomplishes what we need it to * working with IT to make the system start printing the form * finding out what address should be used to send the form back (so that it won't just get lost in the shuffle) * figuring out who will handle/process the form and what that involves, and * writing up instructions to detail these procedures. For some people, this may sound excruciating, but I actually enjoy coordinating with so many different areas. (One of my main responsibilities is overseeing these types of projects.) I like knowing about these random corners of the company and knowing who I need to go to to accomplish all these tasks. And it feels great when it's all done and you see it working as you expected."}]}

But there are some things we do know. Impressions left by dinosaurs haven't shown us anything weird yet. Birds tend not to have cartilaginous ears and noses, so it's unlikely their ancestors did. And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points. For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen.

{"id": "118vty", "input": "why do people find ass attractive.", "output": [{"answer": "Island A: 99 men, 1 woman. Island B: 99 women, 1 man. Which island will reproduce faster? Obviously B since the job for a man in the reproduction process is to just stick it in and bust a nut, but what about the woman? She is designed to bear the child for nine months, and raise it for years after birth until it is suitable to live on its own, but the woman can't do it on her own, she needs help and more importantly protection. This is why women focus more on personality traits and tend to take longer to give in to sex. Their minds are hardwired to find a man who will stick with them and be a protector for not just them but the offspring that they *might* produce. The male, on the other hand, technically speaking can reproduce in a matter of minutes and be done with it. This is why men tend to be more focused on physical aspects at first glance. The main idea, though, is that these attraction traits in BOTH sexes are based on how suitable the other will be as a child-bearer, since at the end of the day, our number one goal as a species overall, is to survive as long as we can and make offspring that can live longer than their predecessors. Ass, in particular, is important to a man *subconsciously* because they know that a woman must have a 5-10 pound bowling ball in their stomach for nine months. If the woman is not capable of executing this task, she will fail as a parent. All that weight in the front of the stomach can cause problems with a woman's back and how she carries out tasks throughout the day, BUT if she has a nice little support system from *behind* to counter all that weight in the front, her chances of bearing that child are much easier. The same goes for breasts. If a woman cannot provide enough milk for her child, s/he will be unhealthy and as a result will most likely live for a shorter period of time than a healthy baby. Men will logically associate smaller breasts with less milk and obviously bigger breasts with more milk for the offspring. **TLDR - Bigger butt means more weight in the back to balance the weight of a child in a woman's stomach**"}]}

So they kept grinding for a while, hoping the VC would take enough casualties to give up but the willingness of the US to fight the NVA/VC wherever they were worked against them as they could choose the place of battle. This meant a lot of fighting where the US attacked carefully prepared defensive positions, where the NVA fought them in close quarters where the US couldn't bring its artillery and air support to bear. So the North, even though they lost more men than they killed, controlled the rate of attrition so that they never lost more men than they could lose. The turning point of the war was the 1968 Tet offensive. The VC launched assaults on the cities of South Vietnam hoping to trigger the collapse of South Vietnam. This did not happen and the VC lost a lot of men, but it still proved decisive as it came after US military brass had repeatedly promised that they were winning the war, there was \"a light at the end of the tunnel\". Tet also showed that the South Vietnamese military was incapable of standing up against the North on their own. So the US had the resources to keep grinding, but it seemed that the war could go on indefinitely. The factors that led the US to exit Vietnam were: *Growing political unrest at home. Not enough to threaten the US social order, but growing and not seeming to stop growing as long as the war went on. *Declining morale among the US troops in Vietnam. In extreme cases this was expressed in \"fragging\", where unpopular officers were killed by their own men with a fragmentation hand grenade, but also expressed in widespread drug abuse and refusal to follow orders. Not severe enough to paralyze the US military machine in Vietnam, but growing and not seeming to stop growing as long as the war went on. *The fall of the \"Big Domino\". The US entered the war partly because of the Domino Theory: if Vietnam went Communist, the theory went, the rest of SE Asia would follow with Indonesia being the crucial \"Big Domino\". After the Indonesian military had massacred the Indonesian Communists this was not a concern anymore. *Distraction from the Big Show in Europe. The US military brass wanted to prepare for conventional warfare in Europe against the Soviet Union, not getting experts in fighting penny ante guerrilla wars and develop weapons for counterinsurgency."}]}
{"id": "jfmz6", "input": "Why am I sleepier when I sleep more?", "output": [{"answer": "Hm, It depends. 1. If you got less sleep than you probably should 8-9 hours during the week, your body remembers every hour of REM it didn't get and it catches up with you on days when you sleep longer. Thus making your sleep work extra hard on that one day when it catches up, making you tired. You can oversleep which would cause you to put your body out of whack. But you would find it very hard to oversleep unless you do the above and NOT get enough sleep. Oversleeping is as bad as undersleeping. I see people are talking about sleep times, I believe that to be false as every person has a sleep schedule that works for them. Just listen to your body and you should be fine. If you always get 8-9 hours of sleep (depending on how old you are, you need less sleep as you grow up) you will be not over-sleeping as much.

They slow down the high pressure escaping gas from behind the bullet by forcing those gases into chambers. It's not blocking sound or anything, it's just giving the gases a sealed chamber in which to normalize in pressure with the surrounding atmosphere, and therefore, no concussive bang or flash at the muzzle. Silencers are also very effective at getting rid of a lot of recoil because the escaping gasses are directed away from the direction of the muzzle. A muzzle brake also reduces recoil by this principal. [Here is a good demonstration of how a muzzle brake works]( URL_2 ). It's easier to imagine a suppressor as a super effective muzzle brake which is completely enclosed by the wall of the suppressor. Like other people have mentioned, if the bullet is travelling at supersonic speeds, then the bullet itself will create a very distinctive crack. You can't get rid of that unless you slow the projectile down, but doing so means that you're losing a great deal of energy. However, guys who want to shoot ultra-quiet, make special subsonic loads. Subsonic ammunition uses just enough powder to push the projectile to just under the speed of sound 1050 feet/sec is a safe benchmark for most altitudes. There are specially designed cartridges which are design to deliver a huge amount of energy on target, but still keep the projectile going slower than the speed of sound. [The best example of this is the .510 Whisper cartridge]( URL_1 ). [Another]( URL_4 ). It uses a smaller than normal cartridge casing behind a .50 caliber projectile normally found in the .50 BMG cartridge. The [.510 Whisper]( URL_3 ) is a pretty unique example of keeping it ultra-quite but having enough energy to be used for any long range applications. So that's it. Silencers are very effective firearm accessories which help make things safer for the shooter and the people around them.

Che Guevara the brand became more \"real\" and went a lot further than Che Guevara the person. Also, revolutionaries in general tend to involve terrible actions. That's the reality of war. The extent to which a person is connected to his or her atrocities after the fact depends greatly on who writes the history books and whose stories get included. History is full of revolutionaries whom history glorifies and glosses over their death toll and presents it as \"justified\" or \"necessary\" or \"a bad thing, but that was the way things were back then. we're better now.\" And some get more of this than others. If we actually exercised a \"no death toll\" policy for our admired historical figures, the list of people we were taught to admire would be much, much shorter. An early or untimely death can also adjust things in someone's favor, as they become memorialized as the person they were then, with no competition from the person they would have become, and as they themselves no longer present a threat to anyone, they might be given a bit more leeway to be seen as heroes now that they're safely dead. Martyrdom, as well, has an effect in that direction. Che Guevara had/has all of those things going for him to become a symbol: early death, an unfinished mission that enables people to think in terms of what he \"could have\" accomplished rather than any reality in which he might have done poorly or failed, the list of terrible actions being perforce shortened by his not getting around to any of the ones that would've been after his death, his adversaries being less inclined to spend resources discrediting a dead man than they would be toward a live one that's still an active threat to them, his potential allies and supporters and fence-sitters being more inclined to be charitable once he's no longer a live potential liability who might in the future express inconvenient views or become too powerful for comfort, it's easy to cherry-pick bits and pieces of his life's work or his views to support all sorts of other, vaguely-related causes, the people who formed the bulk of his casualties weren't valued sufficiently by the rest of the world to arouse widespread condemnation, and he's got that iconic picture that makes him look like the patron saint of freedom."}]}

As for the emotional attachment, it could be partially pathos. Pathos is where the audience empathizes with the character of a story. We grow feelings for these characters. Those feelings can be internalized. Second is a sort of disconnected feeling amongst certain people. Often these people don't have a whole lot of love coming to them from real life.

Those markets were created to allow businesses to move about within stricter environmental guidelines, not as global humanitarian efforts (though they are marketed that way).  > I always thought global warming as the result of human intervention was pretty much accepted. Is the backing for it really that shaky or is this just extrapolated conspiracy talk? The biggest issue here is that it's not a provable thing- climate science isn't physics, and it has a really short history of study w/ regards to climate change as an issue. The vast majority of scientists will agree that the evidence points towards anthropogenic climate change being very very likely. To what degree, and what that means are questions that, at this point, are as much a social science as a science. So, you get a lot of argument between people who believe *almost* the same thing, which fractures the discipline. Also, a lot of climate science comes down to computer modeling and prediction. Consider this with what you know of the accuracy of meteorology, as well as popular culture concepts like 'the butterfly effect', and you can see how the smallest difference in an input variable can lead two scientists to vastly different conclusions.

ELI5", "output": [{"answer": "I'm only commenting here because I feel that I have something that could add some insight into this. I use to work at a blood bank and processed blood that people donate. Sometimes I like to tell people that I have held a bag of AIDs infected blood before, but that's another story. ;) So donors would be asked a series of questions and although the donors could lie, most did not. A few people do lie about it and because every donation of blood had to be tested for various diseases, some use it as an STD test or something like that. Some donors had to give blood because they were ordered by their doctors to do so. These units of blood had to be thrown out because there was something wrong with it. I worked in the back of the lab and processed the blood that the company collected. Reading some of the comments on here I'm not sure that people realize how much work goes into the processing and testing of the donors blood. So there were a few different types of bags used to collect blood depending on what we wanted to do with it. The simplest type was a double bag system like this one  URL_0  and we would start to process it by putting each bag into a plastic cup, weigh it out for putting them into a centrifuge. The process would separate the red blood cells from the plasma. This is where the second bag would come in at. Once the blood and plasma were separated you would drain the plasma out and into the other bag. The device that did this was a device where you would put the blood bag into and would squeeze it into the other. Once you got all the plasma into the 2nd bag, you would seal it and break them apart. Now let me take a moment to explain something. There were times when just based on the plasma you were able to figure out someone's gender (the plasma was green due to some birth controls) and you could always tell if the person as obese. The plasma looked like milk shake mix. The reason for bringing this up is that these were set off to the side. Unless the plasma was usable, ie able to be sold to a hospital, it would be put off to the side. It was not thrown away, but was instead sold to overseas companies for an insane amount of money. These bags would be weighed and the weight written on them and frozen. Once a week a truck would come and pick up a pallet of the stuff. We also processed other donations another way, but the bag used was a three bag system similar to  URL_2  and was processed the same way. However once the plasma was extracted, you would spin the other two bags again. You would then squeeze out the plasma and what was left were platelets. We processed a lot of these units because platelets have a short time frame and after that you had to throw them away. So you have the potential to have 2 or more products off one donation. There are a few other products you can make from just one donation. That is all that we did for those. For the red blood cells, we had to process them further using a process called Leukoreduction (  URL_1  ) which in a nut shell, remove the white blood cells. You can do around 70 to 100 units an 8 hour shift. On top of all this processing, you have people that are attaching the blood type stickers. You would also get doctors and nurses that would order a specific type of blood Rh which if that happened, one of the higher paid doctors would just randomly grab a blood bag and run a few tests that could take a few hours. If it didn't meet the requirements, another random bag was picked to run tests on. You also need to keep in mind that this stuff was not held at the hospital and the doctors ordered on a need by need basis so we used our own system of drivers and some different curriers. Please keep in mind that the job I did was not that technical and is a job that has no real requirements. In my book it was a slight step up from fast food. I hope this helps and can put some of this into perspective."}]}

Some F'ed up... Went home and bought big trucks, drank all day, had a bunch of women until their money ran out. Then they come back and do it again. The smart/lucky ones went home to live decent lives being the boss of a nice sized farm. They often took vacations back home for extended time. I was told by them that the whole dangerous boarder crossing thing with coyotes and what have you were for dirt poor mexican crossing for the first time. Once you had some money you flew over the boarder for cash. It was no more dangerous or difficult than legals flying to mexico. I had the privilege of doing the payroll for a group of them for a few months. Dont want to give too much detail away but this group were paid piece work. It wasnt slave labor wages but the piece work was well under the standard. The company was saving money for sure but... They were so damn fast and efficient some of the guys were pulling paychecks that would put them at 60k- 70k per year. It wast 100% steady but the most of them were floating at around 40-50k per year. More than your average office worker at the company. Did I mention they would buy/lease/rent a large nice house with 7-8 bedrooms and bunk 2-3 per room all chipping in to live cheap. The wives made all the food each day for lunch. They all sat and eat the food the wives prepared each day together. It was really awesome actually. Food was great. Except for Fridays... Fridays the wives didnt have to cook because friday was drinking day after work. They would order fast food / take out that day. They all had fake docs. Fake SS#, Fake DL, and such. You buy these on the street. One of the supervisors was the point of contact and would send new hires off to get docs if they didnt have. They used these docs when they got hired. They even passed the government screening, forget what it is called now. When the forged docs didnt and a red flag came back, the guy was sent away to get new docs and just filled out new paperwork as another person. Rescreen and hired. As much as I liked these guys it was wrong. Not wrong of them for abusing this system. Good on them. Wrong for the company to knowingly allow this. To turn a blind eye to it. To keep it at a legal distance so they had deny ability while gaming the system. I must say I was and still am openly jealous that while they have no employee matched 401k... they basically had a 401k were for each dollar they put away they got 10 added to it. I really hit home when one day the police came on site. They were looking for one of the employees. He was a driver. See one guy always drove the others. The guy with the good docs or DL. If they got pulled over for speeding they would give false information, get a ticket, and never show up for court. Who cares when its not REALLY you. Who needs insurance? So back to the police. That day in the morning while driving to work the mexicans pancaked a car with a mom and some kids in it. Killed the mom from what I heard. The mexicans all took off. Hit and run.

{"id": "1j1zhb", "input": "If the Big Bang theory is correct, how could nothing exist before the universe existed? What existed before the universe existed?", "output": [{"answer": "Not many people seem to have actually given an answer beyond \"impossible to know\" or \"this question makes no sense due to a technicality\". There actually are theories about the idea, involving quantum physics, it's not just a complete mystery. Unfortunately, I'm probably way too late for anyone to notice this, but here it is anyway. First off, we didn't know there was anything outside the Milky Way until 1925. *1925*. Seriously. Edwin Hubble first started talking about it in 1922, and some others even earlier, but they were all ridiculed until Hubble finally formally proved there was trillions times more in 1925 and it was huge news in the scientific community, like if CERN had turned out to be right about those superluminal neutrinos. Keep that in mind while thinking \"No, this seems too ridiculous.\" As Sherlock Holmes/Arthur Conan Doyle once said, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. So, maybe we'll have found out that the Big Bang was actually just one of many explosions that's just now joining the rest of the smoke clouds, it would explain why some physicists theorize that the universe may actually be infinite. In the early 1900s, we thought only this galaxy existed. The concept of a universe blew minds. Maybe this universe will turn out to be like a galaxy. As for where it all originally came from, with infinite time the most unlikely things can happen. For example, a comparatively likely thing, such as an immensely dense ball of energy suddenly appearing in the middle of infinite nothing, due to quantum fluctuations. Quarks actually can appear out of nowhere, it's just that they appear for very short periods of time. Larger, even macroscopic things could also appear, but as they get larger they also become much less likely. If they're larger, they're also more stable and don't appear for very short periods of time. Immensely dense balls of energy are obviously unimaginably rare, but given infinite time? It's gotta happen at some point. And an immensely dense ball of energy is basically what the Big Bang started off with. Immensely dense balls of energy have very low Kolmogorov complexity, for obvious reasons. Basically Kolmogorov complexity is how much information you need to describe something, and though it's mostly used in computer science, once we get into this really crazy abstract physics stuff, anything can apply. Immensely dense balls of energy can be summed up thusly: They are x in radius, y in density, and made up of loads of energy. So, really low Kolmogorov complexity. So, if we start thinking about the universe in terms of a massive, massive quantum field, with infinite time for anything to happen, it's much more likely that the Big Bang would have happened randomly, than for something like an armchair to suddenly appear, or a whale plummeting to the ground out of Earth's sky. And that's what the Big Bang was, an immensely dense point of energy that suddenly happened for some reason and started expanding outwards, as immensely compressed things tend to do under such circumstances. Of course now we get into where the massive quantum field came from, and who knows, maybe we're just a simulation run by a computer programmer the next simulation level up who decided to start a program defining the rules for quantum fluctuation and quarks and all that shit and then specified a positively enormous (subjectively, in our eyes enormous of course) quantum field and just let it start running. But at least we're one step further back in the quest for how it all began, assuming this is true."}]}

At the same time China embraced capitalism and US companies rushed to offshore their manufacturing to China. Then China took over the role of being the world's factory.

{"id": "1w79xi", "input": "Why did the U.S. government need a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol, but didn't to ban other drugs?", "output": [{"answer": "The temperance movement sought a constitutional ban, not a legal ban, so as to prevent the ban from being easily repealed. A super-majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity. Many in politics opposed prohibition, and anti-prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time. The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that, without a 2/3 majority, Congress couldn't repeal the ban on the sale, transport, and manufacture of alcohol. Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it didn't include any provisions for enforcement. They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory, while still using their power to block good enforcement. Ultimately, they succeeded -- alcohol was banned, but everyone still drank. Of course, this ended out being a huge disaster, but that's another matter. Daniel Okrant's *Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition* details the nitty-gritty of the prohibition battle including the risk that Congress might repeal. For the record, Congress claims the authority to regulate drugs today under the interstate commerce clause, given that most drugs include components traded across state lines, or are sold across state lines, or are sold by groups that operate across state lines, etc. etc. etc. See *United States v. Lopez* for more information."}]}

Can you trace back a batch of honey to the hive it came from, or is all honey the same?", "output": [{"answer": "\"What is honey\" has been adequately answered already. Harming the bees? No, unless you're doing it wrong. Doing it wrong would entail destroying the hive and taking all the honey in the fall, after plants have stopped flowing. The bees need protection and food for the hive to survive through the winter. Typically, the hives are built so that you can easily remove frames full of honey comb. We had bees when I was a kid, and we would put on gloves, long sleeves, and a mesh hood, to keep from getting stung. We would blow smoke into the hive to drive the bees away, pull out the frames of honey that we wanted, and put the hive back together. To get the honey, we would cut the surface caps off of the comb, and centrifuge the honey out. Finally, different flowers certainly have an effect on what the honey tastes like. I can't answer you about tracing it back, but there are certainly measurable differences between clover honey and apple tree honey. Also, mass market honey you find in stores is almost certainly not real honey. It's far easier and quicker to make it from sugar and flavorings than to deal with bees. If you want real honey, go to a farmer's market or something similar. Edit: upon further review, my last statement is questionable. The \"fake\" honey is apparently ultra-filtered honey, which removes all the pollen. This process causes the honey to be less likely to crystallize, so it has a longer shelf life. It is still an open question whether some honey might be manufactured instead of bee-made."}]}

Without wanting to get into a long winded piece about the history of search engines, essentially prior to Google pages were listed according to how many times the search term was seen on a particular page. That wasn't particularly helpful. What Google did was change how pages were ranked. They basically looked at peer-reviewed scientific journals and created an algorithm based on that model. The theory is that the more a give paper is cited by other papers in a similar field, the more valuable that paper becomes. THis was applied to web pages. So just as important as the text on the page was who was linking to it. That forms the basis of PageRank. (it's a bit more complicated that this but this is ELI5 after all). incidentally, I don't believe that Google actually owns PageRank - becuase the paper that Page and Brin wrote on the idea was done during their time at Stanford, I'm pretty sure Stanford University owns the patent. Google paid them for it's use in shares which worked out pretty damn well for Stanford). Anyway, ever since search engines have worked by looking for the links and relationships between pages as much as well as the page content. Whether or not everything is 'goddamn awful' in comparison is open to question - other places have made pretty big improvements in the past few years - but you only have to google 'google' to see it's ubiquity.

{"id": "8ig56n", "input": "How did ancient people discover how to refine stuff such as grapes into wine or cooking made food taste better?", "output": [{"answer": "Cooking is something that may have caused humans to evolve differently from other animals. We are tens of thousands of years removed from our primative ancestors. While this may seem like a long time nowadays based on technology progress, it is actually a very short time scale for evolution to happen. Therefore, our bodies have not changed much from our ancient ancestors. Our bodies are not well-designed for raw foods. In contrast to other animals, humans have very small jaws compared to head size. We cannot chew as much as other plant eating animals. Many plant eating animals spend a great deal of their day chewing up their food to aid in digesting it. Since humans are omnivores, we also eat meat. But our small jaws doesnt allow for large muscles to tear and rip apart raw meat. Have you ever tried to eat too-raw meat? It ends up extremely fiber-y and tough to chew. So how have we managed to survive while still powering our extremely energy-draining large brains? Cooking. Cooking breaks down food so that it is easier to eat. Easier to eat means less time spent eating and more calories that can be digested from the meal. It's not that humans discovered cooking but cooking is what allowed us to evolve into humans. Therefore it is hard to pinpoint how exactly we discovered how to cook. Fermentation is a form of cooking but using bacteria, yeast, and/or mold to break down foods before we eat it. Fermentation was necessary because there really wasn't many ways to store food, especially in regions where food rots easily. Fermenting foods use a \"good\" edible rot that prevents \"bad\" or poisonous rot from living on the food. This way, fermented food can keep longer and we also get the benefit that it is partially digested (more nutritious) and free from poisonous rot. How did we discover it? Foods pick up the spores of these microbes from the air. Sometimes we are lucky to have good rot taking over the food. Someone may have decided to try older stored food only to realize it was edible and may have tasted better."}]}

Doesn't it make most people just fall asleep eventually?", "output": [{"answer": "There certainly seems to be a connection between alcoholism and writing, but I think what you're saying might be confusing cause and effect. One of the big challenges of remaining functional despite having a serious substance abuse problem is keeping a job. If you're working in an office environment and they catch you drinking on the job you're probably going to get fired. They also tend to get bent out of shape when you do things like come in hung over and take a little nap under the table in the employee break room or whatever, even if *on average* you're way more productive than your co-workers. It's possible to keep a job like this when you'd rather be blitzed most of the time, but it's a fucking grind. Being a novelist means you're a free agent most of the time. If you want to get day drunk for a week and then buckle down and produce a week's worth of writing in an afternoon that's totally fine. There's no boss hanging around wanting to smell your breath, you're a free agent. For a drunk who's capable of doing it, writing is pretty close to the perfect career.

For it's style of living and habitat good eyes would be pointless. It's not going to see much in the muddy waters and its usual food has a strong smell to it. It's logical to assume that eels don't have the best eyesight and an outstanding capability to smell just from knowing their \"lifestyle\". Additionally, we can catch an eel and look at its eyes, see how many nerve-endings there are and see, that our assumption holds up, since there are way less of them in an eels eye than say in a pikes eye. Pikes are carnivorous fish living mostly in clear waters and actively hunting other live fish, so we'd already assume that they have good eyes."}]}

{"id": "51k0g0", "input": "Why do heating pads (or any other warm thing) help with period cramps, stomach pain, etc?", "output": [{"answer": "There is a theory called the Gate Control theory of pain which basically states that your brain can only process a certain amount of somatosensory input (pain, pressure, hot/cold sensation, etc.) from a given area of your body at one time. So by applying heat to an area of pain, you're basically distracting your brain from the pain itself. Also, this may not apply to period cramps or stomach aches in particular, but many aches are caused by muscle soreness, which typically stems from overexertion of those muscles. When you overexert muscles, they build up lactic acid, which causes a sensation of pain. Adding heat to an area causes vasodilation (an increase in the diameter of local blood vessels), which increases blood flow in the area, and allows the lactic acid to be drained away from the area more quickly."}]}
{"id": "4hwnpv", "input": "How can antidepressants cause depression?", "output": [{"answer": "Well, this has to do with a number of things but let's just touch on the basics. Your brain has little chemicals called neurotransmitters. There are many different neurotransmitters, and each one has different purpose. They jump between brain cells through a synapse. After they accomplish their job, they return to the original brain cell they came from. When we use drugs, specifically mood enhancing drugs, like cocaine for instance, they have an impact on our ability to complete the \"reuptake\" process, and the neurottansmitter (in this case dopamine) stays in the post-synaptic cell. When this happens with dopamine you get really happy!!! But, your brain stops recognizing the need to produce more dopamine, because it's being supplied by the drugs. This causes withdrawal, or a negative physical or mental reaction to losing the provided comfort of a drug. With anti-depressants specifically, the neurotransmitter effect doesn't always work the way it's supposed too, and often times you can see a reduction in the production of dopamine or serotonin, without the \"high\" given by the drug. Also, if you are misdiagnosed as having a deficiency in something like dopamine when you don't, the drug can cause you to become deficient accidently, so the pharma companies cover their asses by laying that on the doctor for misdiagnosis. There is a lot more complexity to the neuroscience that takes place here, but this is a basic run through of the major issues."}]}

What is this \"neutrality\" in Net Neutrality? It's the **indifference / non-interference** that we expect from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with regards to what **kind** of data they transmit to/from us. We already pay for data transmission, and we already pay **more** for **faster** data transmission. Just not what **kind**. --- I still haven't worked out exactly how someone with this power would use it to make money, but consider this ... contrived scenario:  >  I subscribe to Comcast's package A, which promises to deliver 4Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream connection.  >  Scenario 1 (with net neutrality): Comcast lets me do what I want, so I can do the followings:  >  - download large files at near-3mbps speeds: Maybe a 2GB+ Windows image in a bit more than 1 hour. Note: 2GB / 4Mbps ~= 1.14 hours.  >  - stream HD movies without stopping to buffer: Maybe a 2GB+ movie that lasts 93 minutes. Note: 2GB per 93 minutes requires a 388KBps = 3.1Mbps internet connection, which is well under our 4Mbps capability.  >  Now, let's play devil's advocate and try to come up with ways Comcast can charge me more.  >  1) They can throttle my connection so that neither of those tasks finish as expected. My download takes more than 3 hours and my video stream spends ~100% more time buffering. Since this performance is clearly unacceptable, they'd then offer me a better package at a higher price. I don't know whether or not they're already doing this.  >  2) More discretely, they can throttle your data stream only for types of data that they don't like (for whatever reason). So your download would still finish in a bit more than an hour and you'd still be happy, but your movies won't play satisfactorily. In heroic manners, Comcast comes along and offers you a \"video package\" that \"boosts\" your video streaming connection for a \"small monthly subscription fee\". I don't know the legal details, but they may get away with doing this because they actually *do* serve you the subscribed speed of your package (so they technically didn't lie legally when you signed the contract).  >  3) Things can be a bit more bleak for a small start-up company, as their needs tend to be more \"focused\". This is wildly speculative, so feel free to ignore it. As a user, you may not die if video streaming is taken away from you; you can still watch cat gifs or play online games. A start-up company tends to serve only one type of service, which likely involves one data type. Take a DRM-free video streaming service for example (we don't care whether this can ever be a legal business). Their lives depend on video streaming. If the only ISP in their area throttle their video data transfer speed, they either pay extra or get screwed. And then of course they can jump into the service providing game, eliminating competition until they are the primary provider of certain services you depend on. Then charge you cut-throat prices for them. I imagine this is what happened to the cable TV. Exclusivity of certain TV shows and hundred-dollar subscriptions. Eventually, the internet may look like an amusement park. You pay once for the ticket to get into the area, then pay again for everything you do."}]}
{"id": "3du1qm", "input": "Why is it so controversial when someone says \"All Lives Matter\" instead of \"Black Lives Matter\"?", "output": [{"answer": "Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"*everyone* should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share *also*. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any! The problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"*only* I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out. That's the situation of the \"black lives matter\" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society. The problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn't want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged white woman being killed *is* treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we *don't* treat all lives as though they matter equally. Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"black lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that black lives should *also* matter. But responding to this by saying \"*all* lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"*only* black lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" *as a direct response* to \"black lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem. TL;DR: The phrase \"Black lives matter\" carries an implicit \"too\" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying \"all lives matter\" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to."}]}

Some of this may be vague to the point of slight inaccuracy, but I get asked this by kids a lot. There are three layers of a computer. The first layer is hardware. That's the part you can kick. Next is a layer called \"the operating system.\" That's what makes the computer useful; it brings all the hardware inside the computer together to run software on. On top of the operating system is the third layer, software. That's your games and stuff. For the last 20 years, you pretty much had only three choices in operating systems. If you wanted to have a huge choice in hardware, you chose Windows. If you wanted everything to \"just work out of the box,\" you chose Apple OS, but your hardware choices were what Apple gave you and get old rather quickly. Then you had Linux, which worked on all sorts of hard ware, but was really hard to use until about 10 years ago. Linux is not \"better or worse\" than anything overall because it depends on what you need it for. If you want something that will run pretty much any software out there on the cheap, you choose Windows. Most people do, as a matter of fact. Including people who want to steal all your names, passwords, photos, and use your computer to hack other Windows computers. Because it's so easy to use, it's also easy to break into. If you want something that is much, much more secure, but still easy to use, you choose Apple. But not a lot of software runs on Apple unless you are a serious writer, designer, or artist. Only about half the stuff you can run on Windows can be used on an Apple computer. Also, you can't really mess around with the hardware; you get what Apple gives you. And it's more expensive than Windows or Linux. Then you have Linux. Nowadays, Linux runs on pretty much everything: computers, Apple computers, cell phones, and lots and lots of teeny computers. But the software is very, very limited to really serious computer software. Very few games run on it, and since most of the users are programmers, hackers, and people who love computers to run other things... the games have gone to the wayside. But Linux is very, very, very safe because is designed to only do what you tell it to do... and no one else. Also, there is such a huge choice in what program can do what (like 30+ text editors alone), you may find it hard because there is no one singular \"best of everything.\" So asking what's \"better\" is hard. Linux and Apple are more secure than Windows, although Windows is getting better. It comes from how the creators think about their operating system. Windows is \"permission inclusive\" while Linux is \"permission exclusive,\" and Apple is somewhere in the middle. Think of it this way: You are a duke of a land. You don't have time to build a castle fortress, so you have one made for you. - Windows Castle Fortress is cheap, and all the doors and windows of the castle are open by default. Also, it doesn't come with a lot of perks out of the box. You have to buy the drawbridge, moat, and all the garrisons inside and those can get expensive. Luckily, you can find some pirate to get them for you for free, but you have no idea if they will come with enemy soldiers already hiding in them. The Windows Castle is also incredibly obvious with bright colors and targets painted on it that glow brightly in the night with blaring horns, so it attracts more enemies than anything else. It's a large target, has a lot of problems which cause it to fall apart depending on where you build it (aka \"crash on certain hardware\"). You add up the missing parts, the holes, and the main target problems... it's not ideal and you have to be careful. Luckily, a lot of people use them. Unluckily, so do your enemies. - Apple iCastle is expensive. But it's much more secure, with only a few open things by default. It also has a lot of expensive options, but it looks really, really nice. - Linux Kastle comes with a lot of options, but requires a lot of reading, even if you buy one fully assembled (known as \"a distro\" like Red Hat, Ubuntu, Slackware, etc). It's so secure, you may have trouble at first figuring how to even get in the damn thing. MOST of the software you can run on it is free. Now here's the best part: Linux Kastle is designed by castle fortress engineers FOR castle fortress engineers. Once you figure out the damn thing, your fortress is like a fucking solid wall of defense with ninja-like hiding capabilities. Not only that, but it can run on any land condition you can think of like in the air, underwater, underground, and unlike Castle Fortress or iCastle, you don't have to have one huge block of castle: you could set up thousands of mini-castles all over the fucking place: in trees, in birdhouses, turn statues into golems, and so on. Is that a river? No, it's 200,000 Kastle systems so small, they look like a liquid, but they all work together as a single mind. But again, you have to be fucking smart to get there. For instance, you could tell your archers to shoot arrows, but if you forget to install arrow slots in the wall, none of your arrows will get to your enemies. Also, you may have to tell the archers not to shoot one another. You better be specific, which can get annoying until you write your own commands to tell them \"when I say fire at the enemy, open a slit in the wall, fire arrows only at the enemy, who wear red shirts, and then you are done, close the slit. Also, don't get hit by an enemy.\" [Source: a Senior Linux admin for a large company, typed reply on a Kubuntu box I use at home as my main machine]"}]}

When we talk about culture and tolerance we are generally using a lens of cultural relativism. That is to say, generally speaking that from our framework we may not understand another culture's practices or behaviors and that's fine so long as we don't judge. That statement could mean one of two things. Either 1. There is no objective measures by which to judge culture and as such, we can't make an objective comparison between the two cultures. Or 2. that we as an individual can not(or at least ought not) make direct moral judgments. This distinction can best be summed up separating the discussion into two tiers. The second example I gave is tier one, the tier we make direct moral judgments about something and the first example I gave is actually the second tier, a meta tier (one in which we are effectively talking about talking about another culture). Philosophical, if we learn that there is no objective \"right\" culture we are effectively learning the meta, 2nd tier. This teaches us that things we may not understand or that might even make us morally uncomfortable can potentially be entirely justified from another framework. However, we are still moral actors and cannot function in day to day life without making moral and normative judgments (that is to say, judgments inflected by our own society). It would literally be impossible. So, we must acknowledged that in practice we must still be able to make moral judgments against practices we find particularly morally repugnant. In short, there is no objective right when it comes to culture (which is a 2nd tier truth). However, some things are so repugnant to our day to day truths (1st tier) that we override our awareness of the 2nd tier and need to act at the first tier. So, the child marriage example. Those in the west believe in certain notions of consent/agency theory as well as certain post-romanticism notions of sex. While we can appreciate certain societies might view the will of the individual or love differently than we do and that's fine (2nd tier thought), the idea of child marriage is so repugnant to our 1st tier beliefs that we will still have to challenge it because it breaches our notions of agency (children are too young to fully be able to commit to a marriage), and post-romanticism views (children haven't developed the capacity to love in the way that is necessary to properly pick a mate). So while we can tolerate the idea that societies are different this, hits us at fundamental presumptions."}]}

So you perceive the cat to only be attentive when you don't want to, don't have the time. Sometimes, however, they are. Most tame cats are cuddly and will run up to you when they are called. Cats who are not called very often, and this will happen after the novelty of \"omg kitty!\" has ran out, and people have a tendency to give their cat a lot less attention than they think they do, they love the little creature and take pictures and are all lubby wubby wubby in their thoughts, but forget to give the cat attention. Which leaves the cat with the option of seeking out the human. Return to \"you remember it when it's annoying\". We have humanized and built personalities for all the animals we keep at pets, because this is what we do as a species. If we are able to recognize a pattern we will however vague it is, and we will build on it to fit us. We're creative, loving creatures after all. Cat's are more often than not solitary by nature which gives them several traits we perceive as \"douchebaggy\", among the \"I do what the fuck I want\"-attitude and the \"I must be free to roam as I feel puny human\"-demands. Combine this with selective memory and a prejudice you get, well. Cat facts."}]}

There's going to be the hair splitters that say \"well, you're mixing DNA from one organism with another incompatible organism\"....so? DNA is a universal code, it doesn't matter if you're talking about an amoeba or a horse. What they really mean is that it's \"bad\" to eat anything that wasn't the result of sexual reproduction, \"naturally\" = \"right\" (although if you've ever seen a racehorse stud on a human-subdued mare, you'd realize it's anything but natural). Did you know that GMO wheat has sustained millions of people in countries that could not produce enough food to feed their people? Or that scientists that study GMO's are often unable to publish their findings because of the controversy (how are people supposed to learn if the research is being stop-gagged to prevent public outcry)? Often times, something being \"bad\" or \"good\" is simply a matter of perspective. As far as it being inedible BECAUSE it's GMO, that's 100% bullshit. Your body breaks down proteins, uses sugars, and produces waste in the exact same way if you eat a Certified Organic Banana Grown in the Excrement of Free Range Jungle Chickens as you eating a GMO ear of corn grown in Iowa.

{"id": "2o9auw", "input": "If body fat is stored energy, how come a morbidly obese person would die of starvation before all their fat is used up?", "output": [{"answer": "To get access to the energy contained within the fat cells in the body you need certain other chemical reactions to occur which require certain vitamins and nutrients and water to take away any of the fat-bound toxins (for lack of a better word). So if you were to not drink or have vitamins the body would be unable to carry out the reactions to break down the fat cells. That is one problem, the other is the guff that binds to fat and your insulin levels, so if you ingest a lot of processed foods which contain all manner of artificial chemicals, in some cases these chemicals cannot be flushed out by the body and are basically bound up in fat cells so the problem can be dealt with a different day. So when your body finally cracks back open that fat cell it may get a small amount of energy from it, but now you have the toxins back in circulation, and if your body is unable to get rid of them (via kidneys/liver etc) then it has to put them back into fat, which takes energy and can send your insulin levels off a bit. So you would not be able to get enough energy to supply the body AND deal with the rising amount of fat soluble toxins so your body would be overwhelmed and would slowly shut down. Assuming the person is taking all the vitamins etc and does not have any crazy toxins bound up within their cells then theoretically they could survive until all the fat is used up."}]}
{"id": "8mx2ov", "input": "Why shouldn't you plug a power strip into another power strip?", "output": [{"answer": "A powerstrip is a way of creating a parallel circuit: all devices you plug in get the same voltage. Since each device uses some amount of power, each will draw some current, which will all pass through the powerstrip wires. Since they're all plugged in parallel, all that current adds up. So the powerstrip tends to draw more current from the same outlet: it \"amplifies\" the possible current being drawn. It's the current that makes wires heat up, it's not difficult to see how this amplification effect can be dangerous. For example, suppose you have a 110 watt lightbulb plugged into a 110 volt outlet. It will draw 1 amp\u00e8re of current from the outlet. Now plug a powerstrip with 5 outlets instead, and plug 5 lightbulbs in the powerstrip. Each lightbulb will still draw 1 A, so the powerstrip is now drawing 5 A from the outlet. Now replace one of the bulbs with another power strip with 5 bulbs. The first powerstrip is now drawing 4 A + 5 A = 9 A from the wall outlet. Most outlets and powerstrips aren't supposed to go above 10 A - 20 A, so you can see how easily this can become dangerous with devices that draw more power."}]}
{"id": "4z6cll", "input": "Nationalism and Globalism", "output": [{"answer": "Nationalism stems from the basic human instinct of tribalism applied to a nation. Wikipedia covers the aspect quite nicely:  > A nation (from Latin: natio, \"people, tribe, kin, genus, class, flock\") is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them - including language, traditions, mores (customs), habitus (habits), and ethnicity. A nation, by comparison, is more impersonal, abstract, and overtly political than an ethnic group. It is a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity, and particular interests.  >   > Stalin's Marxism and the National Question (1913) declares that \"a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;\" \"a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration, but a stable community of people\"; \"a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation\"; and, in its entirety: \"a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.\" Nationalists engage in an ingroup-outgroup mentality, prioritizing the interests of their nation-state and their fellow countrymen; those who are not in the ingroup get the short end or the stick, or, in the worst case, the pointy end. Nationalism does not *automatically* result in xenophobia or a superiority complex (jingoism); by default nationalists respect other nationalists so long as they are being nationalist somewhere else. Most theorize that nationalism is *crucial* for democracy, because before nationalism, people were affiliated with something as tenuous as the ruling figure or ruling family, with loyalty ensured through force and sheer inertia. Obviously, citizens of a democratic state need something greater than the jackboot of the elected authorities to fell loyalty towards. Globalism is among other things a rejection of nationalism; globalists see no benefit - and a lot of harm - in the construct of nation. As such, they frequently go about weakening the nation-state as well as breaking up and marginalizing national identities."}]}
{"id": "7ndrvj", "input": "Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring?", "output": [{"answer": "It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories. Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring. Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. Since polar bears are quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species. Doves and pigeons are another example. There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences. The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time. **Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring. A better way of thinking about it would be: \"if two populations are unable to interbreed, they cannot be considered the same species\". This doesn't necessarily preclude two species from being able to interbreed."}]}
{"id": "2onh7n", "input": "How do fancy jets have heads-up displays, but we don't have those anywhere else in real life?", "output": [{"answer": "As someone who has flown with a HUD, I can see why they aren't used everywhere. We'll start with the design of such displays. The fancy little glass you see atop an airplane's panel has a sizable projector under/behind it. The glass has no circuitry in it, it's just a way of turning that light towards one's eyes. The bigger the display, the bigger the projector. Furthermore, this projector is designed with infinite relief and focus. When you see the 5 degree down tick on a HUD, everything on that line is EXACTLY 5 degrees down from any position where that tick is visible. This isn't a simple thing to do and takes a special projection, programming, and testing to ensure an accurate view. Pilots need infinite relief in tactical jets so they don't have to think of their head position to get an correct view of the display over the world. This ability isn't necessary when you're not displaying attitude information, and in most aircraft it's not really critical to have the other information in one's face. The downside of this is the limited visibility range of this display. If its projection is only 10 degrees wide, you aren't going to see a damn thing if you're 15 degrees offset from the display. Movies don't accurately portray this. HUDs generally show A LOT of information. It takes training to be able to use one effectively and it can easily suck you in to the point where you ignore the outside world. You might as well be looking down at an instrument panel at this point. We have settings to change their modes and declutter them to prevent information overload. All this tech leads to a big, heavy, and expensive device that has to be used from a specific viewpoint and requires training for the average person to use. Still think you need these capabilities for other tasks? Read on. \"Flat\" HUDs exist, that simply display an image that isn't infinitely projected into the world. Unlike in a proper HUD, one has to take focus off the outside and focus on the display to see the number. It might as well be a separate screen or dial. The expense and complication is not justified. It could be useful in a car. Some cars do have this sort of display. They aren't cheap, and how many people crash cars looking at speedometers who wouldn't crash using a HUD? GPS display would be great, but trust me, it would really distract a majority of drivers to the point of crashing. Again, a data heavy HUD only enhances functionality for people who wont be overwhelmed by one. Many people can't get past the data constantly in their view and forget that there's an outside world. Even fighter pilots have to occasionally turn their heads away from displays to unwind a bit. [Information overload is actually a well noted risk for cockpits in general, and is worse with helmet-mounted displays.]( URL_1 ). These are well trained people who's intellect, coordination, and spatial awareness are, on-average, superior to the general population. Think a transparent computer screen is any benefit to you? They look great in movies with controlled lighting and perspectives. [They are impressive but not terribly clear in real life]( URL_2 ). [Do you really want to pay the thousands of dollars it would currently cost just to project very basic information on your windows like you see in the Corning concepts?]( URL_0 ) So who can justify the costs and complexities of these displays at their current level of tech? Anybody who needs unfamiliar information in motion. That's not going to be your typical office worker. It could be the mechanic who needs quick directions to a part in a stockroom or maintenance instructions overlaid on an engine. It's the firefighter who could use a map of a building or schematic of a car (firefighters already benefit from a great, super simple \"HUD\", lights at the periphery of their vision that indicate oxygen remaining in their tanks). It could be an ER surgical team getting the vitals of a patient who's being flown in. The bus driver with memorized routes doesn't need this. Neither does the guy entering data at a console, the retail worker, the line cook, the car mechanic, anybody in most positions of management, our school teachers nor their students, the pharmacist, even many scientists and engineers, salesmen, or hell, pilots. Sure, SOME of those may benefit, but they'd better be making a hearty profit or have an extreme safety need to justify the expenses of integrating HUDs into their jobs. In a few decades when this stuff could be commonplace, it might provide small productivity boosts with little development and purchasing cost. Right now, the use of HUDs for most work would be a waste of money and time. EDIT: Some proofreading."}]}

(As I imagine you realize.) Both Windows 8 and Mac OS X 10.9 and up are very efficient with RAM. Four gigabytes is probably sufficient if you don't *know* a specific reason you need more. On systems where XP or even 7 had trouble running with 2gb, you'll likely find 8 runs better. Likewise but maybe slightly less so, OS X 10.9+ works well with 2gb. Mac OS accomplishes this by, IIRC, compressing the content of RAM and using quite fast solid-state memory in nearly all current laptops and some desktops to handle virtual RAM needs; windows mostly by being very efficient --possibly due to it being designed to run on a wide range of hardware types, now-- with the RAM it does use - i.e. needing less to start with. The reasons for this shift are interesting, I think. And here's what I suspect drove the changes: prior to these latest versions of OSs, RAM and CPU efficiency wasn't of high importance to manufacturers since... 1. users were accustomed to updating components or systems every ~3 years, which is good for computer companies, so no incentive to make things more efficient 2. Increases in CPU capability were easy and everyone could expect next year's PCs to be a lot more powerful than this years 3. the current desires for longer battery life, less heat and power usage, and the ability to run full powered OSs on less than full powered devices weren't things enough people wanted. That is all now changed. I now welcome the deserved criticisms on the accuracy of my post, of which I'm sure there are many."}]}

From your example, the sixth mass extinction. Several scientists in a lab do some ecology simulations, and find evidence that it is statistically possible for X% of species to go extinct. They think this is interesting and possibly concerning, so they publish a paper saying \"we had this simulation result, what do you guys think?\" A reporter takes it, and republishes the story with the headline \"Mass extinction incoming! RUN AHHHHHHH CLICK HERE\" 2) Effectiveness. For example, HIV deletion in cells. Their lab result might have been \"it's physically possible to go into a single bacterial cell with cultured human DNA and remove the HIV code without killing the bacterial cell.\" This is definitely interesting and will likely advance the field of AIDS research by providing more info on how the virus operates, but on its own is useless--this isn't something that can be directly adapted into a medicine. 3) Optimization. Example: the biological amplifier. Let's say you work in a top research lab, and you come up with this awesome thing and publish a paper on it. Right now, what good is it? It's likely very difficult/finicky to produce, it's expensive, and it requires research staff to work with it. Five years from now, they have continued testing the material, and eventually have optimized the procedure enough that the first-level grad students can prepare the amplifiers themselves, it's not incredibly complicated. Eventually, a company's R & D department decides that the technology is looking likely enough to work on. They buy the patent, and start testing it to figure out how to produce it cheaply and consistently in a useful way. Then, maybe 15 years after the material was developed, a company discovers an economically effective and reliable way to implement that technology in a consumer product. Think about how long it was after the invention of the computer that the average person had a PC. It's not that these discoveries aren't amazing or worthwile contributions to their respective fields, but they are all in the \"discovery\" phase, or they are *potentially* life-altering. This means that it will take years before someone comes up with an effective way to implement them, and many of them will never actually find a use."}]}

It is the irrational number with the simplest continued fraction expansion...  >  1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ... ... and it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers *do* show up in science, in ((almost?) exclusively biological) natural processes, though this relationship also doesn't occur as much in nature as is often claimed. The number of spiral patterns in the arrangements of leaves around branches, petals around flowers, and scales around pine cones are often consecutive Fibonacci numbers - see [phyllotaxis]( URL_0 ) - and the higher those numbers get the closer the placement of elements around those spirals is related to the golden angle (the golden mean as applied to the circumference of a circle). This arrangement arises because it is the simplest and most efficient way to arrange petals (for example) such that they all get the maximum amount of sunlight with the least amount of work. In a sense the golden ratio is a lot like a Platonic 'ideal' - the idea that circles (for example) are always just approximations of some ideal perfect circle, that the forms of everything we see in nature are imperfect shadows of pure ideal forms that we cannot perceive directly. In that sense the golden ratio is the ideal, perfect relationship that is approximated in natural forms by the Fibonacci numbers. This leads some people to assume that there must be something universally important about the golden ratio, in the way that ideal-but-inaccessible forms were considered important to ancient Greek philosophers. But such ideas are in the realm of philosophy, not physics. tl,dr: the golden ratio is fascinating in mathematics as the eventual limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and as an organizing principle in some spiral biological processes. Claims that the golden ratio has some other significance or cosmic relevance might be interesting philosophically, but they have little to do with science."}]}

You can imagine a pipe filled with water: * The velocity of the water doesn't tell you how long it's going to take to fill your tank - you would also need to know how big your pipe is. What you want to know is how *much* water is flowing, not how fast it's flowing. * When you start pumping water, the disturbance will propogate at the speed of sound in water (which is about 1.5km/s), but that doesn't mean the water itself is travelling that fast. The water that starts flowing out the end of the pipe when you turn on the pumps is water that was already sitting near the end of the pipe. The reason you can't supply a lithium battery with a higher current to make it charge faster is because doing so can damage the battery. Lithium batteries rely on a chemical reaction to store energy, which can only proceeed so fast.

It was created as a response to the crushing poverty of the Great Depression, which disproportionately hurt the elderly. (It also disproportionately hurt racial and ethnic minorities, but this is an entirely different subject.) It will \"run out\" because of our nation's demographics. The people who reach the eligible age for social security and the cost to give them their earned benefits exceeds the projected input from those still paying into the program. This is complicated further because people are living longer and taking more out of the program than their predecessors did. These are projections though, and projections are not set in stone. One final addition the this mess is that all of the people coming to age now paid more into social security than was withdraw by their predecessors. That money should have been placed in a safe place for later use when it would be needed, since this is essentially an insurance program. However, the U.S. government has a way of reallocating unused funds to other projects, so the money we should have saved up is no longer there. Social Security is not a scheme meant to swindle people out of their hard-earned money, although it has actually done that in the past. It is an insurance program which offers basic, very basic, protection to the people in our society who are often the most vulnerable to economic hardships.

This is much, much less (about 3% after a 1 minute, 1% after 1 day, and 0.1% after 1 month) normal heat production, but it is uncontrollable and cannot be stopped. This is not enough to power the main generator, but it is still a substantial amount of heat. For example, the modern EPR reactor has a normal reactor thermal rating of 4.5 GW. 1% of that is 45 MW, which is enough heat to be a serious problem. A common way of dealing with the heat is by pumping in cold water (either into the reactor or its steam generators, depending on design) and allowing the steam to escape or be re-condensed (depending on if the steam is contaminated). There are a number of different techniques: Isolation condensor - a steam pipe from the top of the reactor runs into a tank of cold water outside the main reactor containment, into a big radiator submerged in water. A drain pipe collects condensed from the radiator water and carries it back to the bottom of the reactor. The water in the tank boils, and the steam escapes. Eventually, the water in the cooling tank will run out unless it is topped up, this can be in a few hours (e.g. at Fukushima 1), to 7 days for the latest designs. Emergency feedwater - Steam is allowed to escape from steam generators or reactor, and additional cold water is pumped in from a large holding tank. Some designs use electric or diesel pumps, but many use a steam turbine to power a pump, capturing energy from the steam being released from the reactor. The correct operation of a steam turbine, however, needs some degree of control. This was used at Fukushima 2 and 3, but in the absence of battery power, the turbines operated abnormally, and may not have worked at correct efficiency, and eventually overheated. Passive heat removal heat exchanger and passive containment cooling: a large cold water tank is placed above the reactor inside containment. A large radiator is connected to the reactor at top and bottom. As hot water rises above cold water, hot water enters the radiator, is cooled and re-enters the reactor at the bottom, once the valves are open. After a few hours the water in the tank boils, and steam builds up in the containment building. The containment instead of being made from concrete is made from metal, allowing the heat from the steam to escape to the air around the building. This is assisted by having a roof tank trickle water onto the outer skin of the building. Steam inside the building touches the cold walls of the building, condenses back into water, falls into gutters and is directed back into the tank. Passively cooled steam generators - Like isolation cooling but for reactors with steam generators. Steam from the steam generators goes to a large radiator and the condensed water is returned to the steam generator. These can use water submerged radiators, but some designs just use air cooled radiators. The steam generators are placed high above the reactor in these designs, so the hot water naturally rises to the steam generators and after cooling sinks back into the reactor."}]}

It was wrecking its own economy in the build-up of WW2 (e.g. [hiding its near bankruptcy by handing out funny money]( URL_0 )), it was desperately short on manpower (parts of the army were demobilized between Poland and France so the men could be sent back into factories to make the ammunition they'd be shooting later!) and so short on equipment that each conquered country had to be plundered for just enough materials to fund the *next* conquest (the soldiers invading Russia had to use captured French and Polish equipment, which were conquered using Czech tanks). The German war economy was a dumpster fire that needed to rape and pillage all of Europe to *barely* match the industrial output of a fully mobilized Britain, with no hope of ever matching the USSR or the USA. (Hence the whole Blitzkrieg idea \u2013 Germany couldn't afford more than a few months war, therefore everyone had to surrender within a few months. Too bad Stalin didn't want to cooperate.) Germany mainly got away with it during the 1930s and the first two years of the war because everyone else was too reluctant to mobilize and match Germany's war machine \u2013 the Great Depression was wrecking havoc with everyone else's economies too, and they instead focused on rebuilding their industrial base to have a healthy civilian economy instead. For France and the rest of continental Europe, this was a bad idea, since Germany could quickly assemble an army *just barely* good enough to take on the continental European peace time armies. But for Britain, the USSR and the USA, this gave them the broad industrial base they needed to out-last Germany. Germany never had hope of sustaining a long war. Not enough time nor resources to build a sufficient navy (and thus no hope of taking on the US or even Britain), no time nor resources to develop high-performance aero engines needed for strategic bombers (and thus no way to even slow down Britain, or hit the Soviet war industry); hell, for a large part there was no time nor resources to even build *assembly lines!* Apart from a few prestige projects like the Bf 109 short-range fighter (too short range to fight over Britain) and the Ju 88 light bomber (too light bomb load to be useful over Britain), Germany couldn't afford assembly line manufacturing for most of their equipment in the build-up to WW2. Even Speer, despite his promises, couldn't rationalize German industry as much as he liked to \u2013 too little resources and too little manpower to get by. He mostly just fudged the numbers by burning through slave labour (literally, in many cases; the Germans killed more slaves while building the V-2 than they did by using it) and allocating all available resources to tank and airplane factories at the expense of \"less important\" industry\u2026 like machine tool factories that made the tooling said tank and plane factories needed to keep running. Manpower, as mentioned, was a similar dumpster fire. Because Germany was pouring all its resources into getting ready for WW2, it didn't have any reserves to invest in, say, mechanized farming equipment. (Not that it would've been useful, with how little oil Germany had.) As a result, Germany needed a **lot** of farm hands and peasants to feed its population, and mobilization for war was only possible by raiding all of Europe for slave labour and food (thus leading to millions of people starving). Again, completely unsustainable; Germany ran out of its nominal manpower reserves by 1940 and was improvising from then on. The Allies, on the other hand, never had that problem \u2013 both because they *had* more reserves, and because they weren't ideologically blind and mobilized women at a much more massive scale in all possible fields (factory work, and in case of the USSR, even front line combat duty).

{"id": "65zpvr", "input": "Why do we have that voice in our head that narrates what we are thinking?", "output": [{"answer": "I hope its will help I get from [ URL_0 ](https://www. URL_0 /science/blog/2014/aug/21/science-little-voice-head-hearing-voices-inner-speech) Most of us will be familiar with the experience of silently talking to ourselves in our head. Perhaps you\u2019re at the supermarket and realise that you\u2019ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. \u201cMilk!\u201d you might say to yourself. Or maybe you\u2019ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you\u2019re simulating \u2013 silently in your head \u2013 how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss\u2019s voice responding. This is the phenomenon that psychologists call \u201cinner speech\u201d, and they\u2019ve been trying to study it pretty much since the dawn of psychology as a scientific discipline. In the 1930s, the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky argued that inner speech developed through the internalisation of \u201cexternal\u201d, out-loud speech. If this is true, does inner speech use the same mechanisms in the brain as when we speak out loud? We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area), which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. Furthermore, disrupting the activity of this region using brain stimulation techniques can interrupt both \u201couter\u201d and inner speech. So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing. One worry, though, is whether the inner speech we get people to do in experiments is the same as our everyday experience of inner speech. As you might imagine, it\u2019s quite hard to study inner speech in a controlled, scientific manner, because it is an inherently private act. Typically, studies have required participants to repeat sentences to themselves in their heads, or, sometimes, count the syllables in words presented on a computer screen. These lack both the spontaneity of typical inner experiences and the conversational quality (think of the conversation with your boss) and motivational purposes (\u201cMilk!\u201d) of inner speech. Although the experience is undoubtedly different for everyone (not everyone reports having \u201cconversations\u201d in their head, for example), what does seem clear is that inner speech is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. Why does it matter whether we have an accurate understanding of what\u2019s going on in our brains when we use inner speech? One reason is that understanding typical inner experience may be the key to understanding more unusual inner experiences. For example, psychologists have argued that hearing voices (\u201cauditory verbal hallucinations\u201d) might simply be a form of inner speech that has not been recognised as self-produced (although there are also important competing theories). Neuroscientists have found some evidence in favour of this theory. When they scanned the brains of people who reported hearing voices, they discovered that many of the same areas of the brain are active during both auditory hallucinations and inner speech. Broca\u2019s area, for example, is often active in people when they\u2019re hearing voices. But if we really want to know what the difference between what happens in the brain during inner speech and voice hearing \u2013 and how inner speech might become hearing voices \u2013 then first we need to understand what our internal talk is usually like. A recent study by researchers in Finland attempted to address flaws in previous brain-imaging studies of inner speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they studied the difference between activity in the brain when participants experienced an auditory verbal hallucination, and when they deliberately imagined hearing the same voice. In this way, they controlled for aspects of the experience such as the sound and the content of the voice. Advertisement They found the main difference between the two conditions was the level of activation in a cortical region known as the supplementary motor area (SMA), which contributes to the control of movement. When participants heard voices, there was significantly less activation in the SMA, which fits with previous hypotheses suggesting that recognising actions as one\u2019s own might rely on signals from motor cortical areas reaching sensory areas of the brain. Of course, none of this is to say that understanding what happens in the brain is the only, or the most important, aspect of research into hearing voices. We also need to understand what the experience is like, how we can help people who are distressed by it, and when there\u2019s a need for psychiatric care. But to do any of this, we first need to know what typical inner speech is like, and the underlying neuroscience is part of that understanding.

{"id": "1mdgxv", "input": "In regard to cars, what is the practical difference between torque and horsepower? I.e. what am I meant to think when someone specifically highlights a high torque number?", "output": [{"answer": "So there seems to be a little confusion with the relation between the two. This is because they stand for two different aspects of work and horsepower is calculated based on the torque. Torque is strictly measurement of force. Torque is defined specifically as a rotating force that may or may not result in motion. It's measured as the amount of force multiplied by the length of the lever through which it acts. For example, if you use a one-foot-long wrench to apply 10 pounds of force to a bolt head, you're generating 10-pound-feet of torque. Horsepower is defined as the amount of energy required to lift 550 pounds, one foot, in one second. From this definition you can see that the components of horsepower are force, distance and time. The measurement of torque is stated as pound-feet and represents how much twisting force is at work. If you can imagine a plumber's pipe wrench attached to a rusty drainpipe, torque is the force required to twist that pipe. If the wrench is two feet long, and the plumber pushes with 50 pounds of pressure, he is applying 100 pound-feet of torque (50 pounds x 2 feet) to turn the pipe (depending on the level of rust, this may or may not be enough torque). As you may have noticed, this measurement of torque does not include time. One-hundred pound-feet of torque is always 100 pound-feet torque, whether it is applied for five seconds or five years. **So, if you want a quick answer to the difference between horsepower and torque, just keep in mind that horsepower involves the amount of work done in a given time, while torque is simply a measurement of force and is thus a component of horsepower**. To see how torque and horsepower interact, imagine your favorite SUV at the base of a steep hill. The engine is idling and the gear lever is in the \"Four-Low\" position. As the driver begins to press on the throttle, the engine's rpm increases, force is transmitted from the crankshaft to each wheel, and the SUV begins to climb upward. The twisting force going to each wheel as the vehicle moves up the hill is torque. Let's say the engine is at 3,000 rpm, the gear ratio is 3, and the vehicle is creating 300 pound-feet of torque. Using the following formula, we can calculate horsepower: Take the torque of 300 multiplied by a shaftspeed of 1000 (3000 rpm divided by a gear ratio of 3) for a total of 300,000. Divide 300,000 by 5,252 and you get 57.1 horsepower that the SUV is making as it begins to ascend the hill. **It is interesting to note that, since 5,252 is used to calculate horsepower by way of torque and shaftspeed, it is also the number in the rpm range at which torque and horsepower are always equal. If you were to view the horsepower and torque curves of various engines, you would notice that they always cross at 5,252 rpm**. At low speeds the transmission's gears work to transmit maximum torque from the engine to the wheels. You want this because it takes more force, or torque, to move a vehicle that is at rest than it does to move a vehicle in motion (Newton's 1st Law). At the same time, once a vehicle is underway, you want less torque and more horsepower to maintain a high speed. **This is because horsepower is a measurement of work done and includes a time element** (such as wheel revolutions per minute necessary to maintain 75 mph). So to answer your I.E. a high torque number means the engine produces a lot of force. This is useful for moving more weight. That's why heavier older muscle cars need high torque while smaller lighter rice burners can get away with much lower torque. *Fun fact: Electric motors like that in the Tesla produce maximum torque at 1rpm. Most of this information was taken from and edited from [this article]( URL_1 ) from Edmunds. Edit: Here is a graph detailing a power curve of a Tesla motor.  URL_0 "}]}

You have no idea how well you are setting yourself up by looking into this at 18. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. It all depends on you, or more accurately, things about you like what you want to do in life, what obligations you have/take on, will you work a stable job or not, etc? The good thing is, you have time to get out in front of it. Take some finance classes. Learn a little bit about how businesses handle money, and apply those principles to your own life. So many things are bought and sold everyday on this gap in people's knowledge. This will teach you the time-value of money and how to calculate the true cost of a thing. Example: let's say you decide to get a fancy watch. You figure you'll spend a couple of hundred bucks every 5 years or so, or you can just spend a couple of thousand once and get a nice Rolex or whatever, and you'll pass that down to your grandkids. What you may not take into account is the insurance costs of owning the watch, and the fact that you'll probably spend a few hundred getting it serviced every 5 years. Suddenly, your \"one time\" purchase is a constant drain on your finances. None of anything else you learn about finances will help you if you spend more than you have. Debt is the ultimate killer. It takes away all of your freedom to make decisions. That doesn't mean it's *never* a good idea to go into debt, but it does mean you should be very sure that you would rather have the thing you're getting now than the freedom you're giving up to make decisions later. When it comes to investing/saving, that's a different ball of wax. You can buy those lame books like *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*, or you can let me save you $10 by telling you what they all say: buy low, sell high. How do you do that? Well, the books will carry on for several chapters explaining different strategies that people have used in the past that worked. Each of these examples is immediately followed by the proviso that this doesn't mean the strategy itself is sound, it could mean the person got lucky. Wait, what? Come on, what's the real secret of these books? Ok, here it is, for real: write books that are essentially meaningless, sell a buttload of them. That's a great way to make money."}]}
{"id": "57h6ke", "input": "What is going on with the U.S. and Russia?", "output": [{"answer": "Russia is a communist country with communism being losely defined as a system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community(government) and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs. The USA are a capitalist country with capitalism being losely defined as an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. Because both countries have such diferent social organization systems, they have a hard time time being friendly with each other. After World War 2 ended, the USSR (today's Russian Federation) used their military influence and power to establish communist governments in a lot of countries in eastern Europe, with one of the countries being Germany, one of the defeated nations in WW2. The country was divided in 2, West Germany, under the protection of the european allied victors of WW2 and also the USA, and East Germany, under the protection of the USSR. Since both nations were on complete opposite sides regarding social systems, they tend to be unfriendly to one another. But shortly after WW2 ended, the USSR had no way to compete with the USA regarding military power because of the atomic bomb. But this changed in the 29th of August of the year 1949, with the USSR first successful test of the atomic bomb. Given the destructive power of the weapon, you could say both nations were somewhat balanced in terms of military power. But what happened next was something that was defined as a race to reach superiority over the opposing nation. The Cold War Both countries started developing technology that could tip the scales, giving one of the nations an edge. Most research was military grade, like tanks, missiles, even more power atomic bombs like the Tsar Bomba, that was over 1500 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in WW2. Fortunately, research also focused on space exploration, with USSR putting the first man in orbit, Yuri Gagarin and the USA putting the first man on the Moon, Neil Armstrong and the second.. wait nobody cares about the second. However the space exploration race aided in the creation and improvement of more powerful weapons, like missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads over vast distances. This so called Cold War reached a critical point when the USSR decided to carry nuclear missiles to Cuba, a country under communist influence. As you know, Cuba is very close to the USA, so the american president was very concerned about having nuclear missiles so close to them. This incident was called the Cuban Missile Crisis. The missiles were transported by sea, so the USA Navy blocked the way for the USSR convoy carrying the missiles. The russian captain decided not to go any further, preventing armed conflict and possibly WW3. Lets keep in mind that at this point both nations had enough nuclear warheads to destroy the planets surface. Fast foward some years, and both countries are at each others throats again, with the USSR invasion of Afghanistan. The USA wanted to fight against the invasion but could not risk direct confrontation with the USSR, so they engaged what is called a proxy war. They decided to give weapons to the afghan people to fight against the USSR. The USSR was well aware that the USA was providing weapons to the afghans, but they had no real proof, could not afford to to lose even more face in the international stage and also could not afford full scale conflict with the USA. Eventually they retreated from Afghanistan due to the severe loss of equipment and some personnel, in what was considered the only defeat of the Red Army in armed conflict. A few years later, a man came to power in the USSR, that almost single handedly diminished the hatred between both countries and created a more open minded government: Mikhail Gorbachev. His policies of open mindeness and the restructuration of the political system in the country helped soothe all the bickering between the USA and USSR. This marked the end of the Cold War and the fall of the USSR, giving birth to the Russian Federation and several other independent nations, most former soviet states, like Latvia, Lithuania. Georgia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan, to name just a few. The Berlin Wall also fell and West Germany and East Germany were reunited as one country again. All was well with the world (well not even close), and there was something that could be considered peaced between both nations. This so called peace last for almost 20 years, until a man called Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia. Putin was a former KGB intelligence officer, that retired from the military to pursue a career in politics in 1991. He quickly rose through the ranks and was even acting president in 1999, after Boris Yeltsin resigned. Vladimir Putin reworked the russian economy, managing to increase the country's GBP for eight consecutive years., gaining a lot of support from the russian people. After he ran 2 consecutive terms, the russian constituition prevented him to run a 3rd consecutive term. The following presidential election was won by Dmytry Medvedev, that appointed Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister. After the constituition was changed to extend presidential terms from 4 to 6 years, Vladimir Putin ran for a 3rd term and won again. Old hatreds resurfaced between both countries over the years, and Vladimir Putin disgruntled with the USA global influence and more specifically, their influence over the Middle East, started escalating actions to gain influence over their immediate neighbours, namely Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. The annexation of the Crimean Peninsula happened shortly after revolution deposed the Ukranian President, that was aligned with the Russian Federation. The Russian Federation claimed they were acting in the best interests of the Crimean population, namely the desire to return to the Russian Federation. One of the aledged reasons was that with the ukrainian shift of power happening and the loss of free movement by the Russian Federation on ukrainian soil, their major naval instalations capable of operation during the winter, would be cut off from them, preventing most military maneuvers by sea in that region during the winter. Fast forward to now. Elections are happening in the USA and the Russian Federation has increased its threats and bold actions, knowing that current president cant do much, and putting pressure on the next president. Donald Trump is on friendlier terms with Vladimir Putin, so he is not that big of a threat to them. But Hillary Clinton's foreign policies might be less friendly. Some say a second Cold War is already underway and if things dont slow down, a full nuclear war could follow, leading us all to the middle ages again. Just on a side note and something to make you sleep better at night, there were once rumors that both countries might have a defined security policy called the M.A.D doctrine. MAD stands for Mutual Assured Destruction, which states that in the event of the majority of the chiefs of staff are unable to perform their duties, for being dead or for being captured, all nuclear warheads should be fired against the opposing nation. This should prevent a nation with enourmous nuclear power to use it against another nation with similar power, preventing all out war. **TL:DR** Diferences between communisn and capitalism, arms race, Putin's rise to power, aftermath of current US elections and what it means in the near future. And also the fact that i cant do TL:DR, so go read. I wont say im sorry for the wall of text, if you dont feel like reading its cool , im not the boss of you, just dont leave the stupid comments regarding how much of a wall of text it is.

{"id": "3mxbqx", "input": "What happened to the documentary stations (History, Discovery, TLC, Nat Geo) that caused them to focus on reality TV in lieu of documentaries?", "output": [{"answer": "Alright, sit yo ass down and get ready for a story. The TLDR is indeed ratings and production cost. But if that's the why, we must ask ourselves \"why now?\" What happened to these stations, and why did it all happen at the same time? Well, the seed of change (or pestilence if you wanna be poetic) is TLC. Before The Channel Formally known as Learning gave us child beauty pageants and whatever the fuck Honey Boo Boo is supposed to be. You see, in 2007 Discovery was kind of in a hole. As you may know Discovery owns, TLC, Nat Geo, Animal Planet and more. Despite their wide net, the brand was tanking. So they brought in a man from NBC (who would soon sell out to Comcast) to liven things up. The Discovery Channel store was closed, the main station started doing documentaries more fit for history channel with \"True crime\" exploitation pieces. This would in turn hemorrhage viewership from History (A sister network of A & E) who began showing programs like Gangland. Modern Marvels (which had existed since 1995) got a shiny update, and the content of the History Channel become the closest content rival for Discovery. But then, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, or more accurately here comes TLC's shit shows. Ya see, part of the way Discovery was able to have so many networks was appealing to different demos for each one. History had been nailing the males over 40 crowd and discovery had been shooting for educated younger males. TLC was basically discovery channel marketed to women in their early 20s to early 30s, and you know what bored women of that age-range were watching? Soaps, MTV/VH1 reality shows and celebrity gossip. Taking a \"documentary\" series about child fashion shows and editing it like an MTV reality show with a healthy bit of exploitation (the fans of these shows are watching to laugh at these people, make no mistake) and they suddenly had a the right ingredients for what would become a network of cheep, exploitative, schlock across all Discovery Networks (well, except the Science Channel). So What really happened? What really changed? Demographics. Say what you will about these networks being crap, they do a good job of not internally fighting with each other for attention. The Honey Boo Boo crowd doesn't want much to do with \"are Megladon's still around\" the age range, income level, and general education of the demo they're trying to reach can be reliably expected to enjoy the TV click bait. They figured out something Buzzfeed did before you wanted to inexplicably punch it in the face: people don't want to learn, they want to have what they know and like confirmed. This is how Discovery Channels' most profitable stretch, year after year, is telling people sharks aren't violent murder machines (except when they are but it's okay because not to people) like it's the first time anybody has heard this information. Apologies to Shark Week fans, but how surreal is it that the most educational thing on the network is telling a demographic that didn't grow up with Jaws shit they already know from last year? And then there's history channel. History is, again, owned by A & E not discovery. History is a tougher nut to dissect. In short, as they became more direct competition for Discovery they began duplicating what was making discovery successful. Deadliest Catch became Ice Road Truckers, bad speculative science docs became Ancient Aliens. History duplicated the pacing of TLC and marketed it to men, but dumbed its content down to turn the stuff with potential to be good into a filter for Discovery Channel's scraps. A & E went the way of TLC and now theirs no real market incentive to change. If you really want to know whose to blame, look in the mirror. The original demographics have moved on. We're watching Netflix and are simply too educated to watch a show about convergent mermaid evolution. Discovery says they're gonna start making quality programming again, so demand might be returning as Millennials get more disposable income (Oh right, the other big reason! Because of the whole recession thing, cheaper shows became a must and Gen-Xers aged 34-48 had more money than the groups they were, on paper, marketing towards so include this disclaimer in the paragraph about TLC's market shift) and educated young people starting families in their late 20s is presenting itself as a important demographic to snag. In short: The Economy tanked around the same time as the networks underwent massive internal restructuring. Networks that were in mild competition with each other entered a full race to the bottom and neither one went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."}]}
{"id": "5v48cz", "input": "Why did infantry soldiers make a square formation against cavalry?", "output": [{"answer": "It was very effective against unsupported cavalry. At Waterloo, for example, French cavalry fruitlessly tried attacking allied/British infantry in squares for an extended period of time. Forming a square was a purely anti-cavalry tactic, as it had weaknesses, but it worked for at least three reasons (this list is probably not exhaustive): 1. As others have pointed out, there is no flank and all fronts. 2. Horses will not charge into things. 3. Squares are much more densly packed with arms than cavalry. In order, cavalry charging out of where you did not expect them to come and hitting your flanks or rear is an infantry nightmare. Squares prevent this by making sure there are no flanks. Wherever the cavalry is, it is facing an infantry front. This is no fun for the cavalrymen. And unlike what some will have you believe, horses will not charge into things. They will no more run madly into a wall of bayonets and musket fire than you will run into a wall unflinchingly. Anyone who has ever been on a horse will know this. The nearest thing to this happening was at Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez in 1812 when a mortally wounded horse stumbled into a square like a ram and thrashes about (opening the path to other cavalry which charged into the square and - unsurprisingly - had a field day as all the enemy were suddenly showing their rear). Finally, the firepower and bayonets of a square made it almost impenetrable to cavalry. Squares at Waterloo were mostly four ranks deep. The first rank would kneel and plant the musket butt in the ground, with fixed bayonets, creating a wall of spears. The other ranks were free to fire. The infantrymen would stand more or less shoulder to shoulder, many deep, meaning there were a lot of musekts and bayonets pr yard of square front. The cavalry, on the other hand, would ride about outside the square, needing room to manouvre, with considerable space between the horses, all the time sitting on an unstable platform (the horse moving about) whilst the infantry was densely packed and standing on firm ground. The disparity in volume of fire over the fronts of the squares was tremendous, meaning for every carbine or pistol the cavalrymen could fire at the square, many, many times that number of muskets would fire back. The weakness of the square was if it was broken, which it sometimes was when infantry panicked, it was done for. Then it became a death trap. Interestingly, in the movie Waterloo (1970) which was filmed with Red Army extras in huge numbers both as infantry and cavalry, you can in some scenes see squares disintegrating. These were extras in a movie - perfectly safe- but apparently the experience was still scary enough to break them. The real thing must have been very tough going. The other problem was the density. If cavalry was supported by infantry or artillery, the cavalry could force the enemy to maintain a square and then artillery would have a field day with an enemy presenting a perfect target. This was much of the reason for horse artillery, which could keep up with cavalry and help it defeat infantry squares. Or supporting infantry would be able to deploy in line and overwhelm the square with more efficient infantry tactics (essentially having all the infantry face one side of the enemy square, where three quarters of the square would be unable to use their weapons against them)."}]}

You pay a couple grand down payment, make monthly payments - just like buying your own car...but you never get the satisfaction of paying it off and actually owning it. I don't get it?", "output": [{"answer": "It depends what you want from a car. If you want a car to get you from A to B a few days a week using minimal fuel and don't care about how it looks or paying \u00a3100 a year for an MOT on a car that's probably only worth \u00a3500, then you're better off buying a \u00a3500 car as if it breaks beyond repair, it's only \u00a3500 to fix it and this will be cheaper than leasing if the car lasts for at least six months. If this is what you want, then **leasing is not for you**. However, take me for example. I lease cars because it means I get a new car every three years, as I live in the UK this means: * 1) No having to worry about MOTs, as it only needs them after three years of being registered. * 2) No having to worry about servicing, all included and most modern cars don't need it really anyway. * 3) No having to worry about tyres, all paid for, just like servicing. * 4) Gadgets, everyone loves gadgets! * 5) Efficiency. This means all I have to worry about is insurance, fuel, tax and I'm fine with that. Especially as my car has likely paid for itself in fuel already, it can average 75mpg on the motorway at 70mph, and ~60mph in urban traffic, those efficiency gains add up so fast it's unreal. But let's do a little maths, shall we? Basing this off personal and family experience. If I want to have a new car, I can buy or lease, let's take my car for example, a BMW 1 Series M Sport F20.  >  **Buying brand new:** ~\u00a334,500.  >  **Leasing per month:** ~\u00a3500 a month over 36 months. This means that over the three years, I will pay:  >  **Buying brand new:** An unknown amount in servicing/tyre fees, likely somewhere around \u00a33000 over three years, plus insurance and fuel.  >  **Leasing per month:** Nothing other than insurance and fuel. Even if we ignore all those factors, and just do total paid for the car:  >  **Buying brand new:** Paid ~\u00a334,500 up front, paid for and done.  >  **Leasing per month:** Paid \u00a318,000 in total in leasing fees. Yes, I give the car back at the end of three years, so it seems like I'm paying \u00a318k and getting nothing for it right? Wrong! Remember that a new car loses around 25% of it's value the MOMENT you drive it off the forecourt and that odometer ticks \"00001\", bang, a lot of money gone, and then around 10% per year from then on for the first five years or so, let's do the maths: \u00a334,500 - 25% = \u00a328,875 \u00a328,875 - 10% (1st year) = \u00a323,288 \u00a323,288- 10% (2nd year) = \u00a320,959 \u00a320,959 - 10% (3rd year) = \u00a318,863. That means after three years of ownership I have lost (\u00a334,500 - \u00a318,863) \u00a315,637 in depreciation and, trust me, this is a conservative estimate. Some cars drop *much* faster than this, in the UK some cars lose around 50% of their value within the first YEAR. So, final comparison of just \"paying for the car\" costs:  >  **Buying brand new money lost:** Minimum \u00a318,637  >  **Leasing per month money lost:** Maximum \u00a318,000. The reason it's maximum is because nothing is spent on the car as it's all included, as I said above I just pay for insurance, fuel and tax. Plus, I don't have to go through all the hassle of advertising the car, meeting buyers, getting my time wasted, worrying about keeping it \"all perfect\" because, remember, any blemish on that paid-off car of yours drops the resale value! The easiest way I can explain leasing is \"Six of one, half a dozen of the other\", sure, sometimes buying brand new will cost you less, but I'd rather take the security of leasing and have the peace of mind that every three years I have a brand new car that I don't have to worry about in any way, shape or form and that I avoid all the bad bits of car ownership whilst keeping all the good bits."}]}
{"id": "1nfirp", "input": "What are night terrors, and what causes them?", "output": [{"answer": "I had night terrors when I was younger for a few years (8-11) also slept walked during this time. My parents were initially afraid and had me checked out by a psychologist. The psychologist thought that it was due to watching TV/reading just before sleep, leading to being mentally stimulated just before gong down. There is also a genetic per-disposition to having them (several of the men on my mom's side have had them when they were young. My parents didn't know about this until they found out while talking to my mother's siblings). For parents who don't know about Night Terrors they can be crippling. There is nothing they can do until the terror is over to comfort the child. My parents being in the room helped a bit, but the feeling of dread didn't go away until my mind calmed But from personal experience I can remember a few of the times vividly. Imagine having one of your worst nightmares but being completely conscious during it. You are completely inconsolable during the event and hallucinations seemed to happen a bit. I remember waking up and feeling intense dread each time, to the point where I wanted to scream but couldn't or did and woke everyone in the house. One time I woke and was absolutely convinced that my teeth were becoming trees and trying to plant themselves, breaking open my mouth. The muscles around my jaw clenched up and I couldn't talk or communicate with anyone. I tried to move all of my limbs to climb out of bed, but my muscles were taut and wouldn't let me move. My parents eventually checked on me and were able to help me sit up, but I was still scared out of my mind. The feeling that my teeth were going to kill me (as crazy as that sounds) was the forefront of my mind. Another time, I woke up sleep walking into the living area. I sat down on the couch with my parents (and aunt/uncle) and they wanted to know what was up. My parents initially just thought i was sleep walking, but I can clearly remember them realizing that I was in the middle of something. They had my aunt/uncle and one of my parents went into the other room while I stayed. During this particular event, I felt that the ground was giving way slowly pulling me into it. I remember hallucinating a flying green skull that was screaming just on my periphery. This caused me to emit one of those blood curdling scream. A part of my mind knew it was false, but I couldn't stop feeling completely helpless and about to die. There were a few times when I wanted to run out of the house and my parents had to restrain me, which just leads to a larger sense of dread on the sufferer but probably helped me stay safe. If you know someone who has them (or have a child), most grow out of them in adolescence when the body can process most stimuli. Be aware that this can make sleeping over at other people's place a nonstarter."}]}

You have an incalculable amount of information floating around in your head, but obviously you don't need access to it for the overwhelming majority of your existence. It's just sitting there, waiting to be called upon or activated, which can happen quicker than a ray of light. One of the major ways we learn things is through association. If this, then that. Your brain forms tiny little connections between stimuli* and outcomes, which might seem \"random\" or even arbitrary. For example, whenever I hear my niece's dog Stacy suddenly get up from lying down on the couch, the bell on her collar rings and moments later her Mom walks through the door. I start to associate the bell with her mom coming home. This is a ELI5 version of classical conditioning, but I hope you take my meaning. The point is that it's not a conscious thing, and it can happen with stuff like \"I heard this song while I was jogging once, and I saw a person jogging which reminded me of the song.\" We don't always catch these things, because again, they can seem so disjointed and \"random\" to us when we consciously consider them. You might find yourself listening to a song on YouTube one day and suddenly something in the video reminds you of this comment. The mental assocation happens so fast, and in an mmmbop it's gone, but you find yourself at the end of the song wondering why you're thinking about Reddit comments. *EDIT: Said stigma. Meant stimuli.

{"id": "4zijn3", "input": "How do doctors know that patient is about to die?", "output": [{"answer": "Working in aged care, you get to know the signs. What doctors and nurses call \"work of breathing\" gets harder. The sounds of their breathing get either slower, or raspier, or shallower. Sometimes it sounds like they are snoring. Blood begins to not circulate as well, so the extremities (fingers and toes) get colder and turn faintly blue. Capillary refill is extremely sluggish - if you press the end of the finger or toe and release it, the finger or toe remains white for much longer. The heart tends to beat more slowly and with less force, the different sounds of which can be detected with a stethoscope. Consciousness may fade in and out. The brain starts to shut down, and hallucinations are quite common. The eyes may track objects we can't see, they may speak to people who are not present. Generally speaking, there's no deathbed confessions or last words, they usually slip into unconsciousness some hours before death and everything just slowly winds down. It's not uncommon for the kidneys to stop producing urine, although I do remember helping my mother in law to use a commode about an hour before she died. Usually we apply a continence pad, but it's almost always clean and dry due to digestive processes having stopped. Usually the appetite and thirst mechanisms have closed down up to several days before they die. We offer food and water in small amounts, but it's more for the comfort of the family than the patient - the digestive system stops working and they just don't want to eat. As I told one family who wanted to give their mother food so that she wouldn't die - they don't die because they are not eating, they don't eat because they are dying. There is no hunger, but the mouth can sometimes feel dry so we will often swab the mouth with glycerin swabs for comfort, and apply lip balm. They tell us hearing is the last sense to go, so even if the loved one appears unconscious, it doesn't hurt to say \"I love you\" one last time. It is a privilege to care for someone at the ultimate end of life, and I know I for one do not take it lightly. Our elders have sometimes been in our care for years or even decades, and can be like family to us. I have shed tears leaving someone's room for the last time. I have hugged their family and felt their loss as my own. I have worked in my current job for over 8 years, and there is now only one resident left who was there when I started, but over a hundred have gone in the meantime. I remember them all."}]}

I cannot add anything but an anecdote that was a powerful enough experience to convince me that more than the placebo effect is at work with acupuncture in some cases. My first girlfriend many years ago had an older greyhound rescued from the track. One day it was on its last legs with arthritis getting bad in her neck and legs. She got to the point one morning where she could not get up and was just whimpering in pain. I told my girlfriend we couldn't let her remain in pain; we needed to put the pup down. My girlfriend had heard about a guy that did acupuncture on animals and wanted to try it, but agreed to take her dig to the vet to euthanize her if acupuncture didn't work. I carried the pupper in to the place and laid her on the mat he had on the floor; the dog was in so much pain she couldn't even pick up her head. The guy did his thing and poked her here and there. I had to step out to take a call but about 20 min later the pup came sprinting out of the room and centrifuged around the waiting room like a 9 month old border collie. She lived another 3 years and when she started to get bad again, which usually was around 3-4 months, my girlfriend would take her back to see the guy. The pup died comfortably in her sleep something around 3 years from that day. I find it hard to believe the dog was convinced of anything in such a way that could cause the placebo effect. I have tried acupuncture myself a few times and got no recognizable benefits. I am not convinced there is nothing to acupuncture. Perhaps we have not done enough rigorous science to find it. Perhaps there are many crappy acupuncturists like the are many crappy Western doctors. Perhaps we should give it a few more looks before writing it completely off."}]}

Where is the border between consciousness and unconsciousness?", "output": [{"answer": "Your brain activity can be measured in waves, these waves are measured by an EEG. When we are awake and active, our brain produces beta waves. When we are deeply relaxed but still awake, we produced alpha waves. Theta waves define the first sleep stage. You could say that you could base the moment you fall asleep on the appearance of theta waves. Stage 1 and 2 have them, if you woke somebody up in these stages they may say they weren't even asleep yet, you've probably experienced that feeling before. Stages 3 and 4 become deeper sleeps and the brain produces delta waves. These are the longest waves and signals a deep dreamless sleep. After you move through stages 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, a person generally goes back through the stages backwards except instead of stage 1 they go into what's called REM sleep. REM stands for rapid eye movement and that is what characterizes this sleep stage, you may have witnessed this in someone else. This is the stage where you will dream. This whole cycle takes about 90 min. You will continue cycling though the stages this way but REM stage will get longer and the time you spend in stage 3 and 4 will get shorter as the cycles go by. I apologize if this is messy, I'm exhausted and on my phone. Looking forward to cycling through these stages myself in a moment"}]}

Mathematicians think it's \"wrong\" because they believe that there is no evidence for these claims. As a consequence, they feel that sacred geometry has nothing to do with mathematics. Furthermore, you'll find many scientists, mathematicians and psychologists go further than simply considering a pseudo-scientific claim \"wrong\", but they will get actively perturbed by it. I find I'll do this as well. I think there's an analogy to free jazz or contemporary art. These fields are complex and nuanced, and you need to understand a good deal to appreciate them at all. To a layman free jazz might sound like indiscriminate tooting, and contemporary art may be reduced to a man nailing shoes to a wall and calling it art. Sacred geometry is akin to that layman getting on stage at a free jazz show and making noise with his saxamaphone or nailing his shoes to a wall at an art exhibit; he perceives no difference between what he does and what the artists do because he never actually understood what the artists do in the first place. You, as a professionally trained and dedicated free jazz musician or contemporary artist, have dedicated your life to this field and find the layman's performance a celebration of ignorance. To you it seems disrespectful that the layman has so little faith that there are deep levels of meaning to your artform, simply because he cannot perceive them. It feels like an effort to reduce your way of life to a gimmick. So, beyond not believing in sacred mathematics, you'll likely find mathematicians outwardly derisive and hostile to the idea because they perceive it to be not just incorrect, but a mockery of the great catalogue of understanding compiled by centuries of geniuses who dedicated their lives to it."}]}

{"id": "2nravh", "input": "Why don't Americans/English take off their shoes when entering a house, even their own house?", "output": [{"answer": "It's easiest to explain this initially by looking at why people of many Asian cultures DO take their shoes off. I can't speak for all Asian cultures, but I've spent a good amount of time in Japan and over there, the floor plays a far more significant part in daily life than it does in the west, despite the increasing modern popularity of western furniture and beds. Traditionally, the Japanese sit directly on the floor, possibly with a cushion, around a low table. This is where you eat, socialise and work. When you sleep, the bedding material is rolled out directly onto the floor, and then put away again the next morning. On that basis, it's clear that having a clean and pleasant floor is *extremely* important, and as a guest it's culturally significant to take your shoes off as a mark of respect for your host and for their home. Compare that with the west, where we have historically always raised our living space upward. Chairs and dining tables for eating, matresses on bed frames for sleeping; in stark contrast to Asian attitudes it's culturally accepted that the floor is a dirty place, and that it's *okay* for it to be dirty. So it's not that we *don't* take our shoes off in the US/UK, it's merely that there is no specific culturally mandated rule that we must, and so people are free to make their own house rules based on their personal preference, upbringing, and living situation. Some people mix and match and have intentionally hard-wearing and easy to clean floors downstairs so that it's no problem to keep your shoes on, and then a \"no shoes upstairs\" rule where it's carpeted. I personally take my shoes off in my house as it has carpet throughout. As a guest, your behaviour is generally expected to conform to that of your host, and whether you may leave your shoes on or not when you visit someone is dependant on what they themselves are doing."}]}

I've worked for Playboy (yes, they used to own hardcore porn sites) and many other big names. We make our money from a variety of methods. Nowadays, that money is very much a shadow of its former self. It used to be very easy to monetize surfers, and we all got wealthy in a hurry. In the current industry climate, consolidation has been the key. Where once sites could stand on their own, now larger players buy the smaller players and group them into networks, creating economies of scale and synergies. One of the largest of these companies, Manwin, has been on an acquisition spree in recent years. Ancillary revenues are now important, where once they were ignored. The signup used to drive revenue. Now, it's much more diversified. We do cross-sales (selling a membership to more than one site when you sign up) to wring more money out of each customer. We also sell dating services (Adult Friend Finder, Fling, etc), and cam services. The signups are drying up due to all of the people giving it away for free, and it has put a lot of people out of business. Those who continue to survive are typically focus on niche or micro-niche content (which is harder to find for free), or have huddled together into the aforementioned larger networks.

For the few people that don't have enough bandwidth, Youtube added an adaptive quality feature that automatically makes the video shit if your internet isn't as good as they think it should be. Because the video quality can keep changing for people with sub-par internet, and because the people with fast internet don't care, Youtube figured that storing the video for seeking purposes isn't worth the effort to program or the space that buffer takes up.

While math is completely universal, how we represent that math in numbers is completely man made. We use a base 10 system, mostly because we have 10 fingers (some cultures finger count differently and they tend to use a different base for their number systems). All base 10 means is that we represent the number 10 by place a 1 in a new column, and start our counting again at 0. Now for any given base some fractions are going to be easy to represent, and some are going to be hard to represent. In Base 10 the fraction 1/9th is hard to represent, which is why it ends up as the awkward 0.111... . This leads to what looks odd, and that is that 9/9 = .999... = 1. But there is nothing special about base 10 math. If we take one common way to show how .999... = 1: 1 / 9 = .111... 2 / 9 = .222... ... 8 / 9 = .888... 9 / 9 = 1 = .999...

Stress can cause these because it puts the person persistently in a \"fight or flight\" mode.

Your brain is basically saying hey body, you need to be ready to react and move, so be a little tense. If it lasts a long time it is thought to cause possible damage to muscles. This damage may become evident as knotted areas in muscle fibers. This is of course an oversimplification, and knots can be a subject of debate when it comes to scientific evidence. I hope this helps when it comes to a possible theory."}]}
{"id": "2noyqz", "input": "How do we automatically know to say \"black leather chair\" rather than \"leather black chair\"? Is there a formal way to order adjectives?", "output": [{"answer": "Some adjectives are cumulative, which means that we order them so that the most defining feature is nearest the noun. This rule is clearer when we say \"spotted Dalmatian puppy\" or \"green Christmas tree\" or \"fast police car\" because the adjectives police, Christmas, and Dalmatian are so closely tied to their respective nouns that people tend to (mistakenly) think the words \"police car\" count together to form one noun. In your example, leather is more closely tied to the chair because lots of things are black, but fewer are leather. So \"leather\" defines the noun most specifically. It should also be noted that cumulative adjectives stand in contrast to coordinate adjectives, which *can* be reordered without sounding strange. Example: \"The noisy, smelly cat ran away.\" sounds just as natural as \"The smelly, noisy cat ran away.\" The cat is equally smelly as it is noisy. Additional note: as in the examples above, cumulative adjectives are not separated by commas, but coordinate adjectives are."}]}

It may be that it was simply a way of making the victim call out for help from a grownup, thus proving his or her weakness. Alternatively, it may have started as a way of forcing the victim to grant the victor a title of respect \u2013 as in \"Call me Uncle!\" \u2014 for in Roman times, one's father's brother was accorded nearly the same power and status as one's father. The chosen form of the Latin word for \"uncle\" (\"patrue\") tends to support this theory, in that it specifically denotes the paternal uncle \u2013 as opposed to the brother of one's mother (\"avunculus\"), who occupied a somewhat lower rung in patrilineal Roman society.  > The 19th-century England theory says it comes from an English joke about a bullied parrot being coaxed to address his owner's uncle. Upon further digging, here is the joke, which [appeared in various forms in American newspapers]( URL_0 ) between 1891-1907:  > A gentleman was boasting that his parrot would repeat anything he told him. For example, he told him several times, before some friends, to say \u201cUncle,\u201d but the parrot would not repeat it. In anger he seized the bird, and half-twisting his neck, said: \u201cSay \u2018uncle,\u2019 you beggar!\u201d and threw him into the fowl pen, in which he had ten prize fowls. Shortly afterward, thinking he had killed the parrot, he went to the pen. To his surprise he found nine of the fowls dead on the floor with their necks wrung, and the parrot standing on the tenth twisting his neck and screaming: \u201cSay \u2018uncle,\u2019 you beggar! say uncle.\u2019\u201d It seems no one *really* knows for sure, but it sounds as if the expression began as a bully's taunt on Roman Empire-era playgrounds, survived long enough to form the basis of an English joke, which then crossed the Atlantic and became the idiom we use in our vernacular today."}]}

It may *seem* like a reusable vehicle would save money, but that's only true if you're building the Enterprise. Outside of science fiction, you have to deal with the limitations of real world materials and the very real problem of having them survive multiple re-entries. You also have to deal with the truth that technology is not frozen in place, so when you're creating projects intended to last decades they'll spend the bulk of their operational life being obsolete. In the world of engineering, building something that can last for a long time is not better than building something that can only be used once. The point of engineering is to make the inevitable failure predictable. A bridge that is guaranteed to collapse after a year of use is not a bad bridge - it's just a bridge you need to rebuild in a year's time. If it's cheaper to replace your one-year bridge every year than it is to replace your 50-year bridge every 50 years, you build one-year bridges."}]}

The military does not follow the constitution or bill of rights pertaining to military members, but rather the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). It\u2019s a comparative document to the BoR, but it somewhat limits freedoms compared to the BoR. Example: 1st Amendment of the Constitution says you can belong to a hate group (KKK) without recourse. The UCMJ says the same thing, but, it also says you cannot be a active member or attend protests, esp in uniform. Also, it covers rules and regulations during times of war and conduct of members while fighting. The UCMJ also covers what is called Rules of Engagement (ROEs) and Law Of Armed Conflict (LOAC) during times of war. They govern your conduct, who you can and cannot engage, standard procedures during war, and the basic wartime rules (example- It\u2019s unlawful to use a .50 Cal machine gun on personal. They are anti-vehicle and material weapons, and using same against personal could make you subject to Courts Marshal action) The UCMJ also covers conduct in regards to behavior and following lawful orders of NCO\u2019s and Officers, behavior on and off duty, order and discipline, and also allows for what is called Non-Judicial Punishments (NJP) or Article 15 action. Basically instead of going to jail or getting kicked out, you loose rank, get fined, and get extra duty (at the discretion of your Commander) Also, the military does not have trials, but rather Courts Marshals. Military courts marshals are completely different in terms of prosecution and defense as the UCMJ is more in depth than the BoR. Lastly, a Courts Marshal is composed entirely of other military members. The Judge, Jury, prosecution, defense and all other officials are Active Duty or Reserve.

{"id": "3tx4hf", "input": "Why are ideas like Socialism and Communism great in theory, but not so much when actually implemented?", "output": [{"answer": "Your question is harder to answer than you would think. - There are many definitions of socialism and communism. - \"Great in theory\" depends on your political values. - Actual implementation is debatable and its success depends on what you would consider favorable. - People will give you their thoughts on both systems, but you should be wary that it is an extremely politically charged question. **Many definitions**: They come with more varieties than a Japanese Kit-Kat collection and they are often contradictory. They have been reformulated as many times as it was politically profitable. For example, many here cite Marx as the basis, but if you were to read him, you would find him opposed to other communists thinkers that followed him. So let's try very basic definitions. Communism: A governing system where workers are owners of the means of production and actual production. Socialism: A governing system where capitalistic actors are allowed to operate, but wages and capital are heavily taxed and wealth is redistributed to the poorest. **\"Great in theory\"** Let's clear socialism first. In theory and in practice, you would find it similar to what you know in your country (I'm assuming you're from an industrialized country cuz this is Reddit). The main difference would be on your paycheck: a very high wage tax (or a capital tax if you are more well off and trading equities). Government would be involved in a lot of daily life affairs through regulations or public enterprises and would be politically expected to do so. Democracy can be the form of government, but it is not necessary the case. Communism is more difficult to pin down due to the multiple takes on it as I described before. Historically, it was tried with a centrally organized economy and it was tried with letting some form of capitalism survive within. But the theoretical goal is to make the workers the owners of what they make. Old-stock communists see the factory owner as an opportunist who steal the workers \"added-value\" in the products they make. This comes from Marx's views that value comes from labor only and capital and risk are not factors of growth. This, by the way, is thoroughly wrong in the modern economic theory (irregardless of your political stance). More contemporary communists (a rare sight) make a more humanist appeal, saying income gap or capitalism's inefficient waste management are grotesques, for example. Democracy should, in theory, be the goal of communism since it is supposed the promote the worker's power, but... **Implementation** ... it failed to appear in all attempts so far. While communism achieved industrialization in most countries, it generated terribly despotic regimes. In Benjamin Moore's *The Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy*, Moore hypothesized that communist regimes form when the aristocrats ally themselves to the people to squash bourgeois ambitions. In other words, the movement might start as a popular revolution but will be hijacked by the elites to perpetuate their power. The workers are supposed to govern their workplace and enjoy the best conditions, but they are often treated like lemons to be squeezed. Socialism's successes and failures are more subtle. Scandinavian countries enjoyed both growth and fair redistribution of wealth for years, but they had (and still have) complications. Wage taxes reached highs of 70% at one point in Sweden. At this stage, people start to think what's the point of even showing up for work. Public businesses often operate as monopolies which give a rise in prices and lower the number of choices. It's harder to start a business or save money and all of the potential success depends on the efficiency of the government. Some African countries learned this the hard way when they got their independence and corruption just siphoned the money away. The upside can be great healthcare, education system, solid infrastructure and a wide social net. Modern liberal democracies do try to balance some of those goals and the individual's aspirations to a better life. **Politically charged question** This is Reddit. The average user is American, male, white and in his 30s. Americans usually don't like extremes in politics and give the individual a place of choice when thinking about society. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against that. But you won't find a lot of persons here advocating a violent overthrow of the government in favor a subjugation of the people to common ideals. See the other comments in this thread that don't dismiss communism outright: they are downvoted and objected to. I made this one in hopes that it is more explicative and neutral, but as I said, I'm not socialist either. Read what you see here with that in mind if you want a critical view of those theories."}]}
{"id": "xdwox", "input": "why Accutane is dangerous, and why it's still being prescribed by doctors.", "output": [{"answer": "I just finished a 5 month trial of Accutane, and I have been incredibly happy with the results. Background: I am a female in my late 20s, and have been struggling with cystic acne for my entire adult/adolescent life. I was lucky that my problem was not as severe as many others, but my acne was persistent, resistant to **any** other thing I tried, and incredibly emotionally painful. There is almost nothing that can sap your confidence faster than having eye-catching, unsightly problems... with your FACE. I was reluctant to go on Accutane, as I had heard about the potential for serious side effects and had someone close to me experience serious psychological effects that I believe were tied to the drug. The good thing is use of the medication is extremely closely monitored, particularly if you are a female of childbearing age. This drug can **only** be prescribed by doctors or nurse practitioners. You must have a blood test performed 1 month before taking it, and then every month thereafter while you are on it to ensure there are no adverse effects to your liver. As a female, I had to have a blood test to assess for pregnancy every month as well as a urine test in the dermatologist's office. You must use 2 forms of birth control simultaneously to make sure you do not get pregnant, as the drug causes some serious birth defects. You must terminate the pregnancy if you become pregnant. Every month before getting your medication, you must complete an online quiz to ensure you understand the importance of birth control, what methods are effective, etc. In short: they don't play with this shit. The most important thing to do: **REPORT ALL SIDE EFFECTS TO YOUR DOCTOR**. There are some that just about *everyone* will experience, namely dry skin, dry lips, and dryness in the nose. With the right skin care products, this can usually be kept at an annoying, but bearable, level. You also want to invest in a shitload of sunblock, because you will burn very easily while on the med. Accutane works similarly to taking a HUGE dose of Vitamin A (and you will have to make sure you don't take any additional Vitamin A while on it. e.g.: I was forbidden from taking multivitamins) and the side effects are similar. Side effects like depression, suicidal ideation, etc are not very common at all, but are very serious and should be monitored carefully, particularly for those with existing mental health concerns. Many dermatologists partner with PCPs and psychiatrists to ensure continuity of care. In short, talk to your doc. Ask all the questions that are making you concerned. Accutane might not be for you. Some people have had some very bad side effects that they feel are not worth it. For others, Accutane is like a miracle drug. At my last appointment, my doc said \"Your results are amazing. Now you could model skin care products\". I think she was laying it on a little thick, but there has been a **vast** improvement in my skin and my confidence. **TL;DR** *Talk to your doctor.

What is the history here?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm assuming you're asking something like: Why does a 3TB drive cost more than a 2TB drive and the answer is yes, there are material costs involved. First take into consideration what a hard drive is made of: * Enclosure (the casing) * Controller (that green thingy on the bottom) * Drive Platters (basically shiny discs that actually store your data) * Drive Head  &  Etc (How the drive is read) The enclosure and drive head are pretty unimportant in this argument since they rarely change between drive types. What increases the cost is usually in the controller and the drive platters. Let's start with platters. Each platter has a certain physical capacity. Say for example you can fit 1GB of data onto a platter -- It would take 1000 of these to be able to store 1TB -- there's no physical way you could fit 1000 of these into a hard drive (which has certain height, length, width restrictions). So, you'll need to engineer some way to fit more space on a platter. You spend $$$ on research and development and finally (years later) you figure out how to get a whopping 250GB per platter. Now you can take 4 of these put them together to get 1TB. But ... you just spent a fortune figuring out how to store more data on these platters. So how do you recoup your costs? Make the price higher -- the high price reflects the huge investment made in figuring out how to make the drive in the first place. This is also why the price decreases as times goes by. The technology is mostly established for that drive, there's no more costs involved other than production (and occasional maintenance). Now, on to the controller. The controller, as the name might imply, controls how the data is read or written to the drive; it's the interface for your computer to talk to a hard drive. Imagine you spend very little on making a controller. All it does is blindly read and write data -- there's no error checking. So if by some weird mishap data becomes corrupt, it won't bother telling you or even noticing. Sounds like a pretty shitty drive, right? Well, that's why a lot of work goes into making more robust controllers that are catered to the drive. A specific hard drive model will probably have a completely custom controller that cannot be swapped with the controller for a different hard drive model. And this, again, goes back to the R & D in making said controller. After those factors, there's also supply and demand to take into consideration. Spinny drives on the smaller side have a smaller amount of demand, so supply is usually limited which drives the price up a bit. So the price per GB is usually higher than larger sized drives."}]}

You're wrong. The muscles on one side of my leg or arm don't tighten up while I sleep. Physical therapist here (or a \"physio\" for you English blokes) and here's the deal: The neck or cervical spine, is comprised of 7 bones, called vertebrae, that are stacked one on top of another. Between the bones are small, spongy shock absorbers called intervertebral discs. The discs are made up of two parts: the outer part is like a stiff cartilage, like your ear, and the inner part is like a jelly-type stuff. Think of having a small jelly donut between the bones in your neck. There is a small forward curve in your neck called a lordosis. When you sit slouched or bend your head forward, the lordosis straightens. This puts stress on the front side of the discs in your neck, and some of the jelly can push out of place if you stay in this forward bent position too long. When you sleep on your back and your head is being supported by your pillow, your lordosis temporarily goes away, and pressure may be placed on the front of your jelly donut discs. The jelly pushes out of place, pinches a nerve, and you wake up with pain and difficulty moving your neck. As you move around a bit, the jelly squeezes back into place, and in a few hours or days, you're back to normal. If the jelly pushes out of place a whole bunch, then you've got a serious problem. To prevent a stiff neck in the morning, sleep with a neck roll tucked into your pillowcase to support the forward curve in your neck. Don't sleep on your tummy, and learn a few exercises to do prior to going to bed and when your first wake up. Also, learn to keep proper posture during the day. Read any simple book by the great physio Robin McKenzie (from New Zealand) for more info. \"Treat Your Own Neck\" is a good one. tl;dr The small discs in your neck push out of place when you sleep. Use a neck roll to keep them in place and learn a few stretches to do (perhaps from your physical therapist trained in the McKenzie Method)."}]}

What am I going to do with all this space now? If it wasn't a mansion, would my house have been less expensive?\" During sleep, it is believed that memories formed during the day are being stored away into long term memory. Dreams are believed to be the signals that the brain picks up on and erroneously interprets as perception during this process. It seems as though stressful memories are more likely remembered, so you know how to deal with stress later, and dreams are accidentally a way for you to practice dealing with stress without the risk of failure. Also, scientists performed experiments with people falling asleep hooked up to brain scanners. During early stages of sleep, they were woken up, but they reported that they didn't feel like they even began to fall asleep at all. This suggests that awake/asleep is more like a sliding scale, and we don't always know how conscious we are. Therefore, when you try to fall asleep, your brain is probably already preparing to store away stressful memories and have a dream."}]}
{"id": "2985yt", "input": "Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area?", "output": [{"answer": "Itching early in the wound healing process is created from histamine. Histamine has been scientifically proven to increase the rate of healing. But it does not itself cause the itching - it causes inflammation and this makes your nerves go nuts. Your skin is covered in nerves and cells that cause the itching sensation from either mechanical motion (bugs, wind, etc), chemical interaction (irritants), and very low-voltage electrical signals. A scientist discovered that the voltage at the base of a wound is different from the regular voltage of the skin elsewhere. Why this is the case is up for debate but the mechanism at work here is that new nerve cells can follow this ever-decreasing electrical signal so they know where to go. Once there and bonded with other nearby cells the wound slowly pulls itself closed. Or if this is early in the process the bonds are stretched and pulled at by the histamine-aided inflammation and produces the same result. Both the inflammation and the repair cause a small variation in the electrical signal and simulate motion. The inflammation or removal of inflammation is the movement and the nerve cells getting the local voltage back to normal is the electrical. Combined, these make your wounds itch like a motherfucker.

Internet culture. To explain, I don't think anyone knew what the internet would be capable of. We all used it, but for the time (early 2000s) there wasn't lot of communities. 2. Enter the age of the internet war sometime after 2005. Websites began having social conflicts between users stealing memes. I think the main of this conflict was Reddit, Tumblr, and 4Chan. Reddit was also just going through the Digg migration. 3. The meme wars escalate with the parallel rising of third generation feminism, social justice warriors, and flooding Facebook with political garbage during the first Obama presidential run. 4. Once politics got involved in the content wars, everything turned into a culture war fuel by proto versions of SJWs, Black Lives Matter, Alt-Right, etc. The biggest issues that still plague the culture was is hyperbole (over exaggerations). 5. Media saw this as marketable during the years of Obama's presidency and over time it just got worse. That's why we have seen large media shaken a ton after Trump. \"Fake News\" has made a huge wrinkle in media for every one because we really don't know who to trust anymore. 6. Finally, Poe's law, going back to hyperbole. This law essentially defines how people cannot tell parody from extremism which is dangerous. 4Chan parodied social movements a ton but only their worst qualities. Over time, these jokes that are usually going around the net as memes, lose their source. They may get picked up by actual extreme or fringe members of movements, and bam, you get a group of people who accidentally believe bullshit because they think its their \"team's\" bullshit. 7. HOW DOES THIS ALL LEAD UP TO LIMITING SPEECH -- The thing about the social movements going on today is they have a good message. End racism, bring about equal rights for all sexes and beliefs, etc. Here is where it gets funny. 8. The rise of people against free speech -- the social movements mentioned above have the belief that the way we talk about things perpetuates the kinds of changes they want to see in the world. Things have gotten pretty bad where now in New York you can be fined for not referring to someone by their pronouns. People are choosing self censorship to avoid getting in trouble, but it's sometimes like bending over too much for these crybaby extremists. Thing is, again, no one wants to get in trouble. Especially with a group of people who have been known to seek you out just to make you lose your job or something. The American government cannot easily destroy free speech but I do feel there are powers that recognize a way to limit it by influencing our culture and it appears to be working. 9. The ultimate blame is identity politics. People who believe they are owed something or have a right to something just by merit of their identity. Thing is, we all have an identity that we use to define who we are to be shared with other people. The issue became using this identity to get special treatment. Universities and public schools facilitated identity politics to create rules because they don't want trouble from parents or losing students. Now, identity politics is a real power to be feared by people who live under the policies. 10. Tribalism by identity politics -- the real great thing about identity politics and I suppose you could say, identity psychology, is right now it's divided people. You pick teams that match your beliefs. Political leanings, race, sex, or sexual direction groups. Pages on facebook, content creators, etc. They have grievances with other groups that they occasionally complain about and these complaints, existing in the group, make **echo chambers**. An environment where an idea get repeated too much and grows in its communal pathos, ethos, and logos. The thing is, they also tend to go unchallenged because of what can be arguably seen as \"Over Moderation\". Have an opposing view? BANNED. DELETED. HIDDEN. Then you post \"Some people these days. Crazy [descriptor here].\" And its championed. Frightening stuff. It's a crazy multifaceted issue that is still developing today."}]}
{"id": "qiuzl", "input": "Why it hurts so badly when you get in the balls", "output": [{"answer": "There may be no bone or muscle protection but the layer of tissue that encases the testes (the hardest outer part of them) is made of stuff called dense irregular connective tissue. That stuff doesn't stretch like skin or muscles do. When you hurt any part of your body, you increase the blood flow to the region, like when you get slapped and the skin swells. When the soft tissue inside the teste swells after being hit, there is nowhere for that pressure to go, the connective tissue doesn't stretch. Pressure builds and crushes the nerves in the area, causing even more pain. This explains the short delay between a light hit and pain sometimes. If you press on your eye a similar thing happens, pressure builds and sets off pain receptors as the connective tissue around the eye doesn't allow much swelling. Edit: It's actually pretty difficult to cause permanent damage unless you damage the vas deferens. The guys on Jackass aren't sterile, if that says anything."}]}

{"id": "5uz5kd", "input": "Why does going to bed later than usual but sleeping the same amount of hours as you normally would, feel worse when you wake up?", "output": [{"answer": "The major contributing factor is your circadian rhythm. This rhythm is basically your natural biological clock. However it does not run exactly on a 24 hr cycle, there are slight deviations naturally and other factors can contribute to altering your biological clock. The next factor to take into account is which stage of the sleep cycle you are waking up from. There are typically 5 stages of sleep, stage 1/2 are \"active\" sleep cycles, your brain activity is still highly active and almost indistinguishable from a wake person. In stage 1/2, you are also more likely to respond to stimuli, such as someone calling your name. Stage 3 is regarded as \"inactive\" sleep cycle, this is the stage where your brain activity drastically drops, preparing your brain and body to enter stage 4. In stage 3, a person is much harder to wake up and waking from this stage leaves a person exhausted and generally disorientated. Stage 4 sleep is where actual rest and rejuvenation occurs. In this stage, your brain activity is picking up slightly but still in a mild manner, not too much to be called wakefullness, but enough to signal repairs in the body. Lastly is REM stage, this is where your brain is now increasing activity and causing dreams. After REM, the cycle repeats back from stage 1. Basically as you sleep, you go through this 1-4+rem cycle over and over, with each cycle lasting about 90 mins. Depending on what your body needs, stage1/2 will shorten as you go through the sleep cycles and lengthen stage 4 for rest and recovery or REM sleep. If you wake from REM, you will feel refreshed and ready, that is why most people dont remember dreams or recall a dream suddenly disrupted by waking up. If you wake up during stage 3/4, you will feel tired and exhausted, your brain was trying to turn down the power after all, and signal the body to recover from things like exhaustion or injuries. So thats it, a bit long for ELI5, but its a complicated question that takes many things into account, as is common when talking about neurological issues Edit: forgot to talk about sleep deficit and how that also contributes alot, but im on mobile and cant continue forever."}]}

{"id": "m25s8", "input": "What causes the pain from a headache?", "output": [{"answer": "It really depends. There are several types of headaches: tension, cluster, migraine, and some others that are much more rare. ELI5, round one for the major causes: Little pipes full of blood pump that blood to your brain. Sometimes the pipes get too big, which causes little pain wires to get excited. This hurts. (ELI20: vasodilation causes stimulation of the nociceptors, which your brain interprets as pain.) ELI5, round two: sometimes we tense our muscles too much, which causes the same pain wires to fire. This hurts. (ELI20: tension headaches can be caused by muscle tension, often secondary to stress. Eliminate the tension or stress, or both, and the pain should subside. One way to do this is to flex the muscle that is causing the pain- often the trapezoids- shrug your shoulders to your ears until the muscles are very tense, then allow them to fall limp.) ELI5, round three: Sometimes our bodies suck. Your head can get ouchy because of this. (ELI20: genetics can predispose us to migraines. This is unfortunate, and we should try to avoid any \"triggers.\" Triggers are usually things like caffeine, coffee, chocolate, etc.) NB: If you want to know more, I suggest reading [this section]( URL_0 ) of the wikipedia entry for headaches. It has a lot of information, but what you should try to key in on is the type, location, and duration of the pain. This can help you when you talk to your primary care provider about fixing the problem. Hope you feel better! :)"}]}
{"id": "7c0lcl", "input": "Why are there such drastic differences in salaries between different countries?", "output": [{"answer": "I think the real question here is \"Why are some countries developed more than others?\" The other answers do a good job of explaining why high development gives higher wages (High development means a lot of labor is far more productive, and therefore more expensive. This then trickles into jobs that aren't dependent on development, because (a) more money in the local economy and (b) you have to pay workers comparably or they change fields) but none really explain why some countries are more developed than others. This is a major question in macroeconomics, but there are a few theories / causes. One of the accepted theories explaining this difference is called \"premature de-industrialization\" [1]. Normally, a developing country moves from a largely farm-based economy to one built on manufacturing. Manufacturing is a good way to develop a strong middle class, as it's both high paying and relatively low skilled. As manufacturing gets more efficient with better technology, though, the number of manufacturing jobs required to make a certain number of goods goes down. This allows people to move into service jobs without decreasing the total quantity of manufactured goods. Finally, the higher standard of living achieved during the shift to a manufacturing economy allows people to invest in education, which further boosts innovation and growth. This process has gone wrong in the third world. Because developed countries have already developed a strong manufacturing sector, especially highly automated or high skill manufacturing, a newly developing country cannot compete. This forces the country to either compete in very low skilled manufacturing (via sweatshops) that pays workers very poorly to compete with the higher technology of the 1st world, or shift into a service-based economy without the strong manufacturing middle class to support it. Another compelling theory is one of institutions [2]. This theory suggests that countries with good institutions see high economic growth, which in turn supports the very institutions that created it. For example, developed countries usually have democratic governments that strongly defend civil liberties and personal property. They also have a strong financial sector that allows for investment, which is crucial to growth. If a company cannot sell shares to raise money or even take out a loan, it's very difficult for that company to expand. At an individual level, the ability to take out loans allows people to buy houses and cars or invest in education. Finally, a well-developed country has a strong education system, with secondary and post-secondary schools creating a much more skilled workforce. These institutions often depend on a strong economy, but are also necessary to maintain one. Finally, no comparison would be complete without at least a passing glance at colonialism [3]. Colonialism, especially in Africa, allowed for the direct exportation of low-skilled labor from underdeveloped countries to more developed countries. (Remember premature de-industrialization? Imagine that, enforced with guns.) This obviously hindered the growth of African nations and increased the growth of nations that owned the slaves. Furthermore, colonial governments were not usually set up as democracies with the native's best interests at heart. A government designed to export wealth to the colonial power is not one that will foster the strong institutions needed for growth. As evidence for this, consider Singapore and Hong Kong. Both were colonies of the British Empire, but the lack of natural resources meant that they were more useful to the British as trade hubs. Thus, no real exportation of slaves, and they founded strong financial institutions and a framework for democracy. 200 years later, they're still very prosperous, while many former colonies in Africa are not. There are of course more reasons (Malthusian traps, initial factor endowments, regional cohesion, capital accumulation, etc), but this wall of text is a little beyond ELI5 already.

I can't speak for hydration of yesteryear's beers. I don't think anyone has actually been able to prove this. What i can do is clear up some things here. Before WWII beers tended to be lesser ABV. These table beers were thirst quenching quaff-able beers that refreshed workers and helped restore morale. Much like you'd go and get a pesi or a redbull or some other beverage of choice. You dont grab these things for hydration. The point was they were full of nutrients that you would lose throughout the day, and you'd feel a lot better after a hard days work than a measly glass of water. These beers were in affect somewhat safer than poor water resources because of the boiling process. however, during the fermentation process you're inviting all kinds of nasties bugs to come settle in. Brewers are looking for saccaromyces for Wort fermentation. Some styles look for brettanomyces, and lacto. However, before Louie Pasteur we didn't know about them. There weren't yeast banks, or packs of viable strains you could get on the market. Most fermentation was a wild fermentation, and that can be tricky. As for hops. They're not anti-microbial, and they're not antibiotic. They're a preservative. While they do share some antimicrobial assets its mostly the prevention of becoming rancid, browning, and mold growth. As for the special beers (higher ABV) we see them really come forward during industrialization.

The reception is just plain better to start with. Don't forget, the autonomous system is far more than just GPS. Speed sensors keep tracking even if signal is lost (like many modern cars now have). Even if a GPS fix is lost, if you have the last position and an accurate log of distance and direction traveled, it's not hard to figure out where you are now. Cameras and radar (and LIDAR-thanks /u/PangoriaFallstar) are constantly checking around you to react to the real-life traffic and pedestrians that GPS can't help with. GPS isn't what keeps it in a lane or on a road, it's the various sensors. GPS is mostly used for location/routing.

Cynical asses, all of you. Whatever's going on or not, it *must* be due to someone's conniving, right? Election Day *used* to be a holiday, if you go back far enough. It was part of a larger, multi-day event known as a 'muster'. The muster had to do with the 'militia' referenced in the first clause of the Second Amendment: Before the modern republic took shape, the nation had no standing army (\"regulars\") and instead relied on volunteer militias. Or *mostly* volunteer, that is, in the sense that these people were more similar to reservists, if reservists only showed up once a year. Mustering was in some ways similar to the draft, in that it was required by law for 'able' men of appropriate age, though enforcement was mostly in the form of local peer pressure and the social appeal of being one of the manly men who participated. Mustering was a scheduled annual event, and that was a convenient time also to have elections, since at the time it was mostly the same people (landed gentry) who had the franchise. (The womenfolk and others who stayed home didn't vote anyway, so it didn't matter that they weren't there). This was, in that historical context, a very obvious confluence of priorities. Since the muster meant that most men weren't available for regular work, it was an ideal time to hold elections, and so in that respect Election Day was a kind of holiday. It was on Tuesday (in most places) on the logic that most people would attend church on Sunday, then leave for the muster, and it might take time time to get there on the roads of 300 years ago, if you lived in the country -- which most people did at the time. In many places, Election Day was the single biggest event of the whole year. We inherited most of that, but the muster is long gone. If you ever wondered why federal elections are on a Tuesday, though, now you know. It's got nothing to with our parties, which didn't even exist at the time this tradition started. And it started under British rule, not even our own national government, so you can't blame Washington (which also didn't exist at the time). It's just an old habit, one that continues to serve its original purpose well enough that so far, there hasn't seemed much need to change it, or at least no one's come up with a better one and convinced enough others of it. That's all. It's not conservatives or liberals, Republican or Democratic schemers (or even Whigs and Tories), unions, corporations, or any of that other modern-day cynical bile. It's just an artefact of history, okay, folks? Calm the fuck down.

Salt fluoridation reflects the position of the World Health Organization, which has recommended that \"salt fluoridation should be considered where water fluoridation is not feasible for technical, financial or sociocultural reasons.\" Fluoridated salt reaches the largest percentage of residents in Germany and Switzerland.

And that's ALL astrology, there are dozens of different kinds, each with its own contradicting sets of rules. Most astrologies are based on real observations of the motions of the heavens, but typically, these observations were made centuries, even millennia ago, and are not very accurate. For example the 12-sign astrology used most often in the west is based on the Sun being in a certain constellation at the moment of your birth. But because of various factors, those points have drifted over time, and today, your astrological sign is no longer the *actual* constellation the Sun was in when you were born. As far as horoscopes go, they use vague, generalized statements that apply to just about everybody. So no matter what your sign is, most of the the stuff you read will seem to be written specifically for you (and you'll just forget the parts that don't apply to you). Do this: have somebody cut the zodiac signs off a bunch of horoscope stuff, then read through them and see if you can identify which one is \"your sign.\" Spoiler alert: you can't. All of them will contain stuff that sounds familiar, all of them will contain stuff that's not quite right. \"Real\" horoscopes, ones written by an astrologer for a specific person, are already bullshit, but newspaper horoscopes aren't even up to THAT level, some bored intern just cranks out a truckload of standard feel-good aphorisms at random. James Randi, the famous paranormal debunker, used to do a cool demonstration with school classes. The students were told that a famous astrologer was going to come and do their horoscopes for them, so they were asked to write down all the specific details about their birth they could: date, time, place, etc. It was emphasized that they needed to be as precise as possible (which is what we call \"selling the con\"). So a few days later, Randi \"the astrologer\" shows up, and hands out the \"personalized horoscopes.\" The students read them, and then are asked to rate them for accuracy. Overwhelmingly, the horoscopes are rated as exceptionally accurate, dead-bang on. Then Randi tells everybody to swap horoscopes with the person next to them. Yup: every single horoscope was identical."}]}

When people jump out of planes for fun and they are close to the ground, about 3 miles up or so, they are jumping through air that we can breath, and it is really thick. Felix was jumping from so high up, about 24 miles up, that the air was very thin, almost too thin to even notice. This means that when he was falling for the first minute or so, there was very little air pushing against him, which means gravity could make him go faster and faster because there was no air to slow him down. He went over 800 miles per hour! The thing is, both of Felix's parachutes (his main one, and his backup) are only supposed to be opened when you are falling slower than 175 miles per hour. Thankfully, as he fell closer and closer to earth, the air became thicker and thicker. This slowed him down to where he could safely open his parachute and come home! Air resistance, my dear Watson.

With OTA the stream is always there, and it's always on, all you have to do is grab the first decipherable packet and start deciding, you know the next one will be along immediately because it's guaranteed, furthermore if you drop a packet there is nothing you can do about it, so the stream is encoded to be able to continue with minimum disruption but obvious glitches. With internet streams the computer fetches a bunch of data because it doesn't know for sure when the next packet is arriving, the connection might at any moment stop delivering packets for a few moments, so you have to have sufficient data available to ride the gap and this riding the gap /can/ be invisible if you don't run out of buffer, so streaming video will pause and recontinue from the same location because in some cases you can do it without the user noticing. Why the gaps happen is because the internet is a series of pipes of different diameter.... the wire from your house to the exchange can handle less traffic than the wire from the exchange upstream, so obviously when you request a big file somebody has to rate limit the transfer because the internet itself isn't going to hold huge files in transit, the way that any part of the network shows it's over capacity is to randomly not transmit a packet - so YouTube thinks it's sent you the next instalment, but you never receive it, think of what this would do to a game of chess by post, how do you know that your move has been lost in the post? The answer is to resend your last move if you don't get a timely response, but this delay when viewing video causes skips. The most obvious restriction you can ease is the one between yourself and the exchange, buying fast internet means less dropped packets which means less stalls and a faster refill of your video buffer."}]}

They can get shares in a company in another country rather than a salary, so they can avoid paying tax on some of their income. Again this means the poor end up paying more tax. If all of the loopholes were closed this wouldn't be as much of a problem, but that's difficult to do when someone is willing to spend $1M to find ways around the tax laws. Efficiency. Why a percentage of income. If taxes are to provide services, why shouldn't everyone just pay an equal share (e.g. $10,000/yr)? If we do that, then taxes are limited to what lowest earning workers can afford to pay, which is pretty close to nothing. If I earn 10x what my husband does, and we insist we always split the costs, then I end up living and eating very cheaply, but if I contribute more then we both end up with a better house, car, and food. Happiness. $1,000 means more to someone making $10,000/yr than it does to someone making $100,000/yr. It's one thing to not be able to buy a new iPhone, but it's another to not be able to buy food. Starving leads to desperate acts like crime, or armed revolution, which ultimately make the rich unhappy also. Having the rich contribute more leads to an overall happier society. Fairness. There is an idea, particularly in the US, but also in the UK, that people are morally entitled to their income, because being rich is a reflection of pure skill. However, in reality almost everyone\u2019s income results largely from factors beyond their control -- what country you're born in, the quality of schools, the road, water, sewer, and healthcare infrastructure, the legal and regulatory enforcement system, and their parent's income. Imagine being born in Tasmania 1,000 years ago, vs Rome 2,000 years ago, vs India today. Some of being rich is about hard work, but most of it is about luck. From a moral point of view, the rich aren't really entitled to all of that money, so society can fairly ask the wealthy to pay more. By having the rich pay more the society can improve and be happier. However, the society also wants to encourage hard work, so there needs to be some incentive to work hard and be productive so we can't make the tax rate so progressive that the rich lose all of their money. Ultimately even with the progressive taxes, there are enough advantages to already being rich that the rich are making more money much faster than the poor (or even the average), so the existing tax rates probably aren't progressive enough."}]}

{"id": "4cjw63", "input": "Order of operations in math (BODMAS, BEDMAS)", "output": [{"answer": "It's not purely arbitrary. There's a logic behind it. First off there's the brackets, this has to be first because this is how you force an equation to do what you want and override the other rules,if it was after then you'd lose the ability to do something. Next is exponentiation, multiplication and division. This group of three are all united under the banner of product actions. Things that multiply and divide. The order actually doesn't matter for multiplication and division. After that there's addition and subtraction. Again the order of addition/subtraction doesn't matter. So we'll put them under the banner of sums. So why are products given priority over sums? This is one of those things that mathematicians the world over and throughout history have sort of silently agreed with one another. The best suspicion is that all products of sums can be rewritten as the sum of products. EG: you can write (A+3) x (B+5) as (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5), but notice how many more brackets are in the second one. If you made sums have precedence over products, you could write (A+3) x (B+5) as A+3 x B+3, but then you have to write (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5) once you expanded it out. Now if you put products before sums (A+3) x (B+5) stays the same but (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5) becomes AB+3B+5A+5B, it's so obvious you don't even need the 'x' symbol anymore and you save time writing parenthesis. So why exponentiation before multiplication? Similar book keeping reasons. Exponentiation is basically A^2 = AxA. And the product of sums for (A+1) x (2A+1) = 2(A^2 )+(2xA)+(Ax1)+(1x1). But the situations where you want to multiply before exponentiating come up less frequently then quadratic equations and such, at least to early mathematicians, so they just save the brackets and write 2A^2 +2A+A+1 #TL:DR math people are kinda lazy/efficient, they came up with this because it takes less time to write it down that way."}]}

{"id": "44ns7s", "input": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "output": [{"answer": "I shouldn't do this. But I've been drinking and watching football. So what the hell. I'm a PhD and study human evolution. The endurance running hypothesis (which is being promoted by several answers in this thread) is bunk. Eventually it will become consensus in the scientific and public community that Dan Lieberman and his co conspirators have over interpreted natural selections power and did so to fit a particular and biased agenda. The endurance running hypothesis is no more valid than the aquatic ape hypothesis. The best and most simple reason humans are hairless is because we are bipedal. Being bipedal having extra fat within our abdominal cavity could cause herniations or prolapses in our lower bowl areas. Moving the fat outside out abdominal wall released this risk. However. Having this extra layer of fat on the outside also served to insulate. So we needed to ride ourselves of hair to prevent over heating Yes. Over heating is the same root cause. But long distance running is a delusional dream of Lieberman that I can't wait to trash once I have tenure. EDIT: sober follow up: If you want to read a good peer-reviewed paper on why the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis is just adaptive story-telling, find: Langdon, JH (1997) Umbrella hypotheses and parsimony in human evolution: a critique of the aquatic ape hypothesis. Journal of Human Evolution Vol 33:479-494 This is an excellent paper, and all of his points can be easily applied to the endurance running hypothesis. But to boil it down: Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (AAH) has no real evidence to suggest its true other than the appearance of parsimony. That is AAH purports to explain many strange features of humans all at once with a concise adaptive narrative. Features explained are: hairlessness, long hair on our heads, holding our breath, being able to speak, bipedalism, natural-swimming behaviors in infants, etc. The problem with AAH is that other than the ability to explain all these features at once with a single over-arching adaptive scenario, there is no evidence for it. We don't find hominin fossils in marine deposits. The fact that some modern peoples swim/dive for their food is cherry-picking (its not a dominant behavior among modern humans), hairlessness and other features can be explained individually if maybe not collectively, etc. But the most damning part of the AAH is the double-treatment of evolutionary constraints. For those not in the know: evolutionary constraints are forces which 'prevent' evolution. In general terms we think of there being 2 of these. 1st is the 'constructional constraint' which boils down to the laws of physics. Why don't humans have steel teeth? Or wheels instead of legs? These seem like absurd questions, but they only seem absurd because we intuitively understand the constructional constraint. A wheel-like mechanisms can't be built with the biological building materials we have on hand AND steel cannot be forged and shaped within a biological entity. These things are beyond biology's reach because of the laws of physics. 2nd we have the 'phylogenetic/historical constraint' which is basically heredity at work. You look more like your parents than you do any other random person (save for dopplegangers, but you get my point). This is heredity and it can be applied to the species level as well. Our species looks more like its parent species than some random other. And so on up the tree of life into larger and larger clades. This has some important consequences. The first, which is not intuitive, is that without this restriction on form, natural selection cannot work. For it can't be an effective filtering mechanism without there being some reliability of the outcome after reproduction. Second, and more intuitively, it restricts the types of forms organisms can take. You are bound by your heredity to stay within a certain range of features. Why don't we have 6 arms and legs? It would be so useful in the kitchen while making dinner. Other animals do. Why don't humans? Well because we are the descendants of tetrapod fish. That's a lame answer, but the true answer. (Back to AAH) The thing that AAH does is it argues constraints 2 ways. First, that our ancestors apart from chimps were radically re-made (morphologically) because of natural selection working on our form while in the past aquatic niche. BUT we retained these features after this aquatic phase\u2014which we no longer have need for\u2014because of evolutionary constraints. So, constraints are weak and do nothing, then they turn around and do everything. This is theoretically bankrupt. (Sound familiar? yeah, I'm looking at you, all you at the top of this thread promoting your adaptive story-telling and making Dan Lieberman at Harvard seem so smart). To some others in this thread. Dan Lieberman is part of the \"academic establishment\". When you're a lowly post-doc like I am, you don't take on the establishment since they can deny you job opportunities, funding opportunities, and publications. Waiting for tenure is the only way to really rock the boat on a popular idea. Tenure\u2014for all its imperfections and abuses\u2014is designed to give people academic freedom to pursue ideas/hypothesis/concepts without fear of backlash. It does work in that regard. But being a post-doc I don't have that... yet. Lastly, I apologize for using the argument from authority in my original post. It was lazy and un-necessary. Having the PhD in Evolutionary Anthropology does not entitle me to short-cutting claims/ideas/concepts. Also, thanks for the gold and the people who liked this post. But I think this will languish down at the bottom of this thread. I'm not sure if that is good or bad given the shots I've taken at Lieberman."}]}

{"id": "3746j7", "input": "those bidding sites where people pay pennies for stuff", "output": [{"answer": "\"Penny auctions\" and \"All-but-winner-pays auction\" Penny auction is a type of auction that started appearing on the Internet around 2005 and 2006[1]. It works by having everyone participating pay a bidding fee, usually to the auctioning website, which gives you X amount of bids. Each auction has a time limit and a starting price (usually 0$). Each bid raises the final price of the item by 0.01 cent and adds Y seconds (for example 20) to the time left timer. Lets say a site gives 100 bids for 20$, and an item sells for 50$. Bids = 50$/0.01$ = 5000 bids; which has a total price of 1000$. So the seller earns 1050$, which is usually a lot more than the value of the item. The winner can earn a bit if he did not waste too many bids, but everyone else looses money. All-but-winner-pays auction (abwp from here on) is a type of auction where everyone pays what they bid except the winner. It is similar to Martin Shubik's Dollar auction paradox and the All-pay auction model, but differs in that the winner of the auction does not have to pay anything, which is meant to boost incentive to keep bidding on the item. Like the Dollar auction paradox, lets assume we are going to auction away one dollar. We have four players in this game: A, B, C and the seller S. A starts out the auction by bidding 0.05$, B proceeds to overbid A - lets say 0.10$. C joins in with 0.15$. The three buyers continue to increase bids by 0.05$ until one of them, lets say A, reaches 1.00$. At this point A has a potential payoff of +1$ or -1$ if one of the other people overbids hem. For B and C they have a payoff of about -0.90$ / +1.0$. B may bid 1.05$ to still have a chance of winning and minimize his loss. This may keep going until the dollar sells for several times its original value. Let's first look at ABWP auctions from a game theoretical standpoint We have the seller S and the players A, B and C. The players are perfectly rational and will do whatever they can to earn as much value in the short term as possible. At any stage in the game the players are either the highest bidder, or have a chance to bid to get an item for free. Each bid increases the price by Epsilon, so the potential loss for each bid is small (Going in rounds of A, B, C, A, .. the potential loss is whatever you have already bid + 2*epsilon (The other two peoples bids) ). Epsilon is incredibly small, almost zero so players will just keep increasing the price to infinity. So why does this happen to this type of game? In normal auctions both seller and buyers gain between 0 and TV (True Value) value. That is all parties gain something from the trade. We can look at an auction as two groups of players - the seller group and the buyer group. The seller group have a valuation for the product of X, the buyer group have a valuation of {B1 .. Bn}  > = X, where B is the highest valuation. The final price the product sells for is Z. The seller groups profit is in the space {0, Z-X} and the buyer groups profit is in the space {0, B-Z}. Now lets look at ABWP in the same way. The seller group still has a valuation of the product X, and the buyer group have a valuation {B1 .. Bn}  > = X where B is the highest valuation. Z is the price of the money transferred which means the sum of all the bids the loser of the auctions have to pay. At the start of the game when the bid is 0 Z is also 0. Each bid increases Z. The seller groups profit is still in the space {0, Z-X}, so when Z increases the seller group as a whole earns more and more. On the other size the buyer groups profit is still in the space {0, B-Z}, so when Z increases the groups profit decreases. This means that from the buyer groups point of view - each bid they put into the auction lowers their potential earnings, even to the point where it goes into negative. This means that if the buyer group cooperated they could earn value, but if they play as individual players they will lose. In the real world, still using rational people - this means that the only way buyers will gain  > = 0 is if there is no buyers (buyer group has a gain of 0) or a single buyer, in which case the buyer group would gain the true value of the item. In other cases the price and Z will accelerate to infinity. Penny auctions use a slightly different mechanism. It makes the prices look ridiculously low by making most of the price of the item bleed out through a side channel - the bidding fees. A rational player will enter the game and see an item with a price a lot lower than TV. He will buy some bids and bid on the item. It may not seem like much, but when the buyer bid the seller earned money permanently and buyer lost money permanently. This repeats for several rounds with multiple buyers until the price is around TV. Putting this into the equation from ABWP from before we need to change Z a little. The new Z is the sum of the price of all the bids purchased by the buyers plus the final price. Variables would be the following: * PB - Average price per bid * N - number of bids * PI - Price increase per bid Z = N*PB + N*PI = N(PB+PI) The trick to this auction type is that the seller only shows the buyer(s) N*PI (the current price of the item), leaving out N*PB (The price paid for all the bids so far), which is half the equation. We have again that the seller groups profit is in the space {0,Z-X} and the buyer groups profit is in the space {0, B-Z}. With the same equation we draw the same conclusion - that this type of auction unfairly favours the seller group. There are other problems with these type of auctions as well. The most common of the two - penny auctions is notorious for being involved in scamming operations where site admins go in and bid on items in order to artificially increase the prices of items, or prevent users from getting items at all [2]. One of the more commonly used CMS system for setting up a penny auction site - PHPPennyAuction had build in support for bidding bots that would keep bidding on items last second until they either reached a pre-determined price or would make sure to always have the last bid (if a bot wins the site doesn't get any complaint if they don't send out the item on sale).

{"id": "35ogzw", "input": "What socialism actually means.", "output": [{"answer": "EDIT: Done Socialism is the social/democratic ownership of the means of production. It's considered bad because socialism took over a third of the world and was the biggest threat to the American way of life since Nazi Germany, and even then that was a European war. The rallying against socialism movement started when the US put the CPUS (Communist Party of the United States) on trial, and arrested them due to fears of an American Bolshevik revolution which would topple the capitalist system.  URL_0  This event destroyed socialist leadership. It was very public and served as a warning to ALL socialists in America. This is the origin of socialism's lack of precedence in the US and its hatred. Socialism is no longer practiced by any countries except Cuba. Europe is not socialist, but a Social Democracy. Now, I want to explain what the definition of socialism means, and I am a socialist and have been for a few years now. Social/Democratic ownership. This means that society as a whole has ownership, and society can democratically control whatever they own. Think of a table of kindergarteners and they have a box of crayons in the middle. This type of ownership would look like 5 of the kids voting that they use yellow to color the sun, while 3 kids vote for the sun to be colored green. Because 5 > 3, they color the sun yellow. This is opposed to capitalism's private ownership, where instead of society as a whole having ownership, it is one person or a group of people. Next, means of production, the thing that society is owning. Means of production means any facility, resource, or tool that can create a physical and tangible product. Factories, assemblies, oil, uranium, trees, maybe even basic tools like a hammer and nails. (though sometimes the tools are considered too insignificant to qualify) Under socialism, personal property still exists. Family photos, heirlooms, personal belongings, and cars are things you can still privately own because they are NOT means of production. Money does not count as a means of production because it does not directly create a physical or tangible product. Rather, it is used as a medium to exchange for products created by the means of production. Ok, so thats the definition. Next I am going to talk a bit about the different types of socialism. Left Libertarianism: Anarchism and socialist minarchism. Contrary to popular belief, anarchism denotes a socialist economy unless specifically stated to be anarcho-capitalist. These socialist ideologies actually make up the most of the socialist community right now. Most socialists are libertarian socialists. Democratic Socialism: A type of socialism where a representative democracy like what all western civilizations have now is used alongside a socialist economy. Contrary to another popular belief, Europe is not democratic socialist, and one of the more famous examples of this was the Paris Commune. Market Socialism: I'm not a market socialist and I'm not too clear what the exact mechanics are here, but socialism does not always mean planned economy. This ideology wants socialism AND free market to coexist. Market socialists, feel free to expand on this. Marxist Socialism: I don't really want to call this a well fleshed out ideology, because Marxism was a critique of capitalism, not really an ideology of socialism in itself. However, Karl Marx did vaguely go over his idea of socialism.  > Karl Marx had said in his works that socialism is ONLY possible if the transitioning country is INDUSTRIALIZED and DEVELOPED.  > His thought process on how society would transition was something like this:  > **PreCap(feudalism?)** **- > **  > **Capitalism(industrialization/developing)** **- > **  > **Proletarian Revolution** **- > **  > **Socialist state** **- > **  > **Abolishment of state(communism)** Leninist Socialism/all derivatives(Marxist Leninism, Maoism, etc)/Communism: BEFORE I explain this, I must first note something that even socialists get wrong. The word 'communism' is a capitonym. This means that its definition changes based on capitalization. 'C'ommunism is what I will be talking about right here. It refers to Leninist states or states with a vanguard/Communist Party. 'c'ommunism on the otherhand, means stateless, classless, moneyless society. It is the end goal of most socialist ideologies, including the one I am going to talk about here. So, Leninism/Communism is when the 'best of the best' of the workers take control of the government and establish a Communist or Vanguard Party, which should mean a technocracy because the government is controlled by the workers, but this elite group in the government, the state, owns everything as opposed to society. This is justified by saying that the technocratic government is representing the interests of society, so it is social and democratic ownership by an extension. Unlike Marx's idea of socialism where socialism can only be achieved in a developed capitalist state, Leninism was practiced ONLY in undeveloped, newly capitalist or precapitalist states. Lenin seemed fine with this, but he agreed with Marx that the best place for revolution was in a developed country. (which at the time of the early 1900's was Germany) Additionally, when the 'conditions' are 'right' (world socialism has been achieved) the state 'withers away' and the end goal of 'c'ommunism is achieved. In Leninism, there is supposed to be a counteracting 'checks and balances' system called the soviet councils. These are councils across the country made up of workers. Just like how in the US the courts scale all the way to the Supreme court, the councils scale all the way to the Supreme Soviet. This was supposed to exist to counteract the power of the Communist Party. When Stalin came along, he consolidated his power by stripping many of the capabilities of the soviets, including the Supreme Soviet, so that the checks and balances was weak to nonexistent. Next, Social Democracy: Social Democracy technically means 2 different things. It originally meant socialist reformism: the idea that socialism can be attained through reforming of the current system. Social Democracy calls for the reform of our system to democratic socialism. This was unpopular at that time (1800-early 1900's) as most socialists were revolutionaries and believed that the only way for socialism to exist is through a revolution. (democratic socialism was still popular, but most supporters were revolutionaries) Now? Social democracy means a powerful welfare state and a government that actively looks after their citizens. Progressive taxes, free healthcare and education, some state ownership, all hallmarks of a social democracy. This definition of social democracy is NOT socialist, nor does it actually want to be socialist. I'm not going to talk about how socialism could be good or bad for Americans, or how if it works well with other countries, because it seems to boil to opinion and semantics on what 'works well' and 'good and bad' means. If someone wants to share their opinion, yeah go ahead, but OP you will always get a different response. I will finish this off with a real ELI5 example to help understand socialism:"}]}
{"id": "1kfbfm", "input": "What exactly is the church of Scientology and why is there such controversy around it?", "output": [{"answer": "A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time \"The real way to get rich is to start your own religion.\" He later wrote a book called \"Dianetics\" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google \"Xenu\" or \"Thetans\". There's a fairly recent book called \"Going Clear\" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit."}]}
{"id": "8povos", "input": "Why do babies/toddlers scream and cry for a long time when they are tired instead of just going the eff to sleep?", "output": [{"answer": "The behavior you describe indicates that the child is overly tired or had little warning that it was time to rest. Children who are up past the time that their body needs sleep become fussy due to stress hormones building up. Their level of frustration increases, while they also begin experiencing rushes of adrenaline as their body attempts to cope with the stress. Hence why these children can be silly one second and weeping the next. Their ability to cope with minor set backs decreases to a critical point at which most caregivers will go \"Ohhhh, you're tired\" and immediately attempt to put the child down for nap. But interrupting whatever they were doing and going straight into nap is also a potential conflict, as they don't perceive themselves as ready for nap. They're busy trying to rip the wall paper down (or something similar). So now, you've got a baby who is stressed (due to exhaustion) and frustrated (due to having to stop what they were doing for this 'nap' thing you're raving about) and over stimulated (due to adrenaline). And we're expecting them to lie still and go to sleep.... all three of the above things are reasons children cry. It defuses energy and expels stress hormones, and it communicates to you \"I need help, something is wrong with me\". So, how to prevent this. Have a routine... it doesn't have to be extensive. Even just 1)diaper change 2) a lullaby and 3) I put you in your crib can be enough for some children. And in addition to their routine, you have to notice their first tired cue and begin the routine. Rubbing eyes, bags forming, yawning, slowing down, becoming clumsy... these are all cues and each child is a little different. Once you know a child's cue, begin the routine as soon as they have one or two and BEFORE their tiredness upsets them. Other helpful nap time tips - - limit screen time. Children under 3 especially are highly influenced by tv and other video devices. Not only do programs and games make them sedentary so they are not burning energy through physical or mental play, but the blue light messes with their circadian rhythm and sleep hormones. -get outside. Sunlight is best for helping children's sleep hormones regulate appropriately. -avoid relying on tricks or devices to put children to sleep if possible (swings, cars, on top of the washer etc.) These limit a child's ability to learn what it feels like to fall asleep and build this skill. Some families desperately need them to survive the first few years, and if it's what they have to do, that's fine. But a young child will eventually have to unlearn those habits... many healthy infants and toddlers can learn to fall asleep with minimal support. But it does take a lot of trust and patience from caregivers."}]}

There are plenty of non wartime examples of the US military getting sent somewhere to enforce peace to get the job done and leave. What about Haiti? The tsunami in the pacific a few years back? Delivering aid to Africa? The US is the world's largest and most powerful military. It is also the most well funded and effective logistics platform for humanitarian aid. No one argues and claims that's a bad thing, thus no masses of protesters, because generally speaking everyone views it as a good thing. There's also ongoing missions that are not combat related that the US military is vital for. Protecting shipping lanes. For the most part there isn't a great deal of piracy. There is some, but the shipping lanes are relatively safe, protecting worldwide trade. You can thank the US military for that. Flights over the pacific are safe because the US runs air traffic control over the Pacific. US military bases project US protection around the world for allies, allowing them to focus efforts internally and the presence of US military bases are overwhelmingly positive for the local community (despite what people seem to think) economically. Simply put bad shit will happen if the US just pulls out of everything around the world and just stays home. The Iraq war, while incredibly stupid, is really only a tiny bit of what the US military is actually responsible for. Most people don't know about what the rest of the US military does because it's under the radar of public outrage. In time will the world adjust in such a world? Of course. But expect very rough times for a few decades. Don't expect to live your modern life during this time, expect it to relapse to something similar to pre WWI/WWII until the world reorganizes itself."}]}

It could be done, sure, but doing so would be expensive, increase tensions with Muslims living in the west (leading to more fighters for ISIS), cause more bombings of civilian targets (leading to more fighters for ISIS), and continuing a trend of unwanted Western meddling in the middle east... leading to more fighters for ISIS. You can't just bomb a political/religious ideology, and such extreme actions only strengthens the perspective ISIS fighter have that they are standing up against evil- he who does battles with monsters. The biggest problem is, despite trying to start a government, ISIS is an NGO (non-government organization). They're bases of operation are civilian buildings meaning bombing them takes out more civs than it does bad guys. They keep their brass scattered. We don't fully know where they are. And, possibly the biggest reason, because they're already on a shoestring budget anybody that fights them can only bleed themselves dry. They just need to lie dormant and survive until it's too expensive to continue fighting. All the while, other nations' economies grow weak, their people lose the will to fight and the fight against ISIS grows more brutal. Such is the nature of terrorism."}]}

I think Celtic people tended to have more red hair, and they were historically enslaved by other Britons and discriminated against. A red-headed English friend told me he endured all kinds of abuse in school because of his coloration. Growing up in North America in the 80's and 90's, nobody I knew ever had a problem with redheads. In fact, it was seen as a very attractive trait in women (Gillian Anderson is a good example). South Park basically started the whole thing as a joke against discrimination ... like \"What could possibly be a dumber reason to make fun of someone?\" Unfortunately, the creators of that episode really underestimated the stupidity of their audience, and so a lot of kids totally missed the point and subsequently picked up on it (along with the term \"ginger\" which had never really been used outside of the UK) as an excuse to pick on people. Good example of how a well-meaning message actually made a situation worse."}]}
{"id": "2hdsao", "input": "Why do blacksmiths use tungsten inert gas to weld?", "output": [{"answer": "TIG welding works something like this: You have a tungsten spike that is hooked up to the welder (the machine, not the person) and has a handle attached to it. Tungsten is used because it has an *extremely* high melting point. You also have a big metal clamp that you attach somewhere on the thing you're welding; it also goes to the welder. The welder then tries to push a lot of current through that circuit: welder-- > tungsten-- > part-- > clamp-- > welder. Everything in that circuit is a very good conductor of electricity *except* the small gap between the tungsten and the part. Thus, that gap gets extremely hot. So hot, in fact, that it can melt steel. Melting the steel (or other metal, but steel is popular) is only part of the challenge. Once you have the steel melted on both of the sides of the weld you usually need to add just a little bit more material to fill whatever small gap is present, or to fill in a corner to have a small rounded area (a \"fillet\"). For this you hold a piece of steel wire in the other hand and you feed it in or dab it as needed, to build up an appropriate puddle of steel that you're working with as you move along the weld. While you're doing all of this the metal is incredibly hot and therefore quite willing to start reacting with the oxygen in the air. In order to keep this from happening the whole process is covered with a layer of inert gas (Argon, typically). This is dispensed from the same thing that is holding the tungsten spike. The whole process is typically controlled through a pedal, much like the throttle on a car or sewing machine. Properly TIG welding requires you to coordinate the power with your foot, the heat with your dominant hand, and the fill rod with your non-dominant hand. Once you're coordinated enough to handle all of these at once, though, you can make really really pretty and strong welds with incredible finesse."}]}

It's more frustrating for them than terrifying. I worked with a girl who is similar to Helen Keller over the summer last year. The job wasn't the best fit for me, but I stuck it out as long as possible. The girl I worked with was 12 years old, completely blind, and smaller than a fraction of hearing in one ear. With what minuscule hearing she had, she was fixated on music. It was the one thing that kept her grounded. She knew a few signs and could understand tactilly, but with a lot of repetition and patience. I was basically her eyes, ears, interpreter, only way I connecting to the world around her. I had all the patience in the world, but I still couldn't work with her any longer. When we had to put the music away from group activities, she would throw tantrums (verrrry similar to Helen Keller). Because that was her only way of connecting with the world. I give all the props in the world to Anne Sillivan. She is an angel among angels. I had to quit because it was too much for me. She would hit me, kick me, throw my phone (the only way she could listen to music), tear apart multiple pairs headphones and get mad when she couldn't listen to music anymore. I love working with deaf-blind individuals, but I had to do what was best for my health (mentally) and well-being. I was extremely close to withdrawing from working with this group forever. This job required a lot of trust from her, and she didn't have it for me. The kicker? She lives down the street from my parents. Maybe when she gets older I'll stop by and reintroduce myself to her.

You are less noticeable, less threatening if it does see you, and you aren't provoking it into chasing you by running, so other members of the herd that run get noticed, and chased down first. or you fight, and with the adrenaline you may buy yourself time to run, or for others to assist you, or you may even ward of the predator by being too tough for it to be worth it. Or you run, and the adrenaline makes you fast enough that you aren't caught(or faster than the slowest of the herd) I know when I'm hunting deer and it hasn't snowed, if they freeze and are far enough away I won't even notice them. They blend in so well that I typically just watch for movement because every dark bush looks like a deer from a distance to my eyes until I scope it out or see movement. For people who freeze, and never unfreeze, evolutionary anomaly, they would get weeded out. If things go south they should turn to run or fight. EDIT: To add, in modern society it isn't very useful because you are typically freezing in situations when you need to perform some task or move out of the way of something, when historically you just need to not be noticed or run away."}]}

{"id": "3vrml9", "input": "How is the ketogenic diet at all healthy if you're eating lots of fats, which clog arteries?", "output": [{"answer": "If you have to assume something is true to come to a conclusion, and then cannot prove your assumption is true, then your conclusion isn't true, either. So, having said that: Lots of fats do not clog your arteries, in general. As China pointed out there is no link between saturated fat and heart disease, although I'll touch on a paradox that is making rounds in the ketogenic scientific community regarding fat composition of the diet and cholesterol levels increasing in an unhealthy manner. Think of your artery as a 4-lane freeway. If there are 10 cars driving on it at any given time there's less likely a chance of an accident, and it's probably 3 AM. Now imagine that it's just before rush hour and there are a few hundred cars passing the same spot, per lane. There's much more likelihood of an accident happening simply due to the increase of cars. Now, what is a clogged artery? It's the deposit of a CHOLESTEROL (very, very, very important point here, do not forget it) molecule behind the artery wall. It shouldn't be there. The cholesterol was like a car without wheels being transported on the back of a big rig (since cholesterol cannot move freely on the highway). So imagine now that instead of 10 big rigs carrying cars, there are 200. Or 4000. Doesn't matter. If one of those big rigs gets into an accident, it's more likely that the car (cholesterol) is going to get dumped off the top of that big rig to somewhere it shouldn't be. In this case, because there is an increase in the particles that carry cholesterol in your body there is an increase in the chance one of those particles is going to enter the artery lining and cause a cascade of inflammation that results in cholesterol getting deposited, which causes the site to interact even more with the cholesterol-containing particles and the cycle continues until you get the plaque formation (artery clog). Enough of this and it can dislodge and kill you, but before doing so will increase your blood pressure and cause all sorts of other issues. So, when it comes to the ketogenic diet, the increase of saturated fat **seems** to be able to cause an remarkable increase in the particles I mentioned (LDL-P). LDL-P is one of THE driving factors (if not **the** factor) that drives risk of cardiovascular disease, because it's physically impossible for cholesterol to get into an artery unless it's being carried there. More big rigs with cars, more accidents with cars. Now, some people on this diet with the increase of fat start absorbing more cholesterol through their gut lining or start mass producing it. This is simple genetics. So for those people, their freeways are now JAM PACKED with big rigs with cars, so much so that there is a legitimate concern of long-term health. So while the studies show no link, there's seems to be a direct increase of LDL-P on the diet initially for some people, which is a bona fide concern for clogging your arteries, but even then only if the mass of that cholesterol (LDL-C) is also high. I have all sorts of graphs on this but since this is ELI5 I'll leave them out unless you want to see them. However, after 6 months, those levels balance out and can be further thrown off if one is also losing weight at the same time. TL;DR: **Too many cholesterol-carrying particles clog arteries, not fat.**"}]}

Would be great in northern states. - More durable: video shows nice demo of being hit with direct force - Power generation: certainly less efficient than a panel system because trade-offs were made for aesthetics, but makes up for it in a few ways. 1) greater area covered, look at traditional panels, they only cover part of the roof, this would cover the whole thing. 2) Not all panels face south allowing capture during all times of the day instead of losing late-afternoon or early-morning sun with south-only facing panels ( URL_0 ). 3) If install truly is easier as claimed then more houses will have it 4) No more pre-planning for installation, hiring a solar company to assess your site to determine whether installation on your house makes sense - if you need a new roof you just install this instead, similar process and similar effort to a regular roof making it a practical option even for those who would normally never think twice about installing solar. As to how they work, I can only assume they've developed a click-together system to make quick install with special pieces for the top and edges. IMHO there would be no point in distributing a product much more complicated than this; their company doesn't already have a network of installation specialists so spending a little extra on R & D up front to make it installable by someone with minimal training would make sense for them. If you think about Tesla, Musk already has a network of supercharger stations all over the US even before tesla has become numerous enough to make sense to allow rapid growth of tesla as able. If these needed specialized equipment I would have expected him and the company to already be involved in developing a network of installers and companies to train them. Lets say these shingles pan out and are a practical and cost effective roofing alternative, we're probably about one, maybe two, generations away from general use. to amp up production in a meaningful way I would estimate would take 5-10 years (look at how long it's taken Tesla to increase production from small-scale to large-scale production although subtract some time from this number because they've got the gigafactory already rolling). there will likely be some adustments, recalls and bugs to work out in the first few years. the majority of people won't adopt this until it's been proven for a decently long period of time, and then the rate of replacement of a roof is 20 years so most people wouldn't switch over until they're due for a new one even once the practicality and longevity is proven. TLDR: I'm going to go out on a limb here and guessing that this will be wildly successful technology that will ultimately help decentralize power generation for all the reasons listed above, but will still take a long time to become ubiquitous."}]}

Fathers usually have a position of power over their children, so if they have sex with their daughters it's very likely that this power is abused. In your case they don't know that they are related, so there's no power to abuse. Incest may lead to genetic defects, but it's not that big of a problem if it doesn't\u200b happen at a regular basis. (Just consider the odds that someone is accidentally sleeping with his daughter. There are other reasons for genetic defect which are much more likely to happen.) Inbreeding is a problem in some aristocratic families, yes, but they married their relatives at a regular basis, not just once. Edit: Some countries, mine (Austria) included, don't allow anonymous donors. Every donor is recorded and when the child reaches a certain age, they have the right to ask for the identity of their biological father. It's not to prevent incest, though. Some governments just believe that everyone has the right to know who their biological ancestors are. (I don't share this belief.)"}]}

In France you can spend your hard earned money on a tiny portion of some beautiful delicious delicacy, but people don't do this in America. We (Americans) want as much food for our money as possible. We love good deals, and lots of food. It's all very utilitarian, perhaps dating back to World War 2, the Depression, or all the way back from Pilgrim roots, etc. etc. Now that food is plentiful, this utilitarian food culture is a huge disadvantage. Nutritional science is stuck back in the days when we barely got enough to eat. Vitamins use to really matter for normal people. Now, normal Americans eat so much they never have to worry about how many vitamins you eat (except for alcoholics, some vegans, the elderly, and pregnant women). So, we're stuck in the mode of looking for \"nutritional density\" or the most vitamins per calorie. But, the whole idea has become meaningless for the normal American (note \"normal\", not all Americans). Utilitarian, but also ignorant. Everything is apparently bad for us. Surprise, you ate *tons* of something and it turns out to be terrible for you. Our ancestors barely ate any sugar, and most didn't even have a consistent supply of carbohydrate for millions of years. Sugar wasn't bad for them, we just never evolved to handle the vast amounts that we eat today. We never really had much evolutionary exposure to plentiful food. Diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease... merely a evolutionary mismatch. Why is this ignorant? Our food culture over simplifies and twists this idea. The fructose in high fructose corn syrup is bad for us, but the same fructose in fruit is good for us somehow? Coconut oil has gone from a something terribly unhealthy for you into a miracle food. And a million other nonsensical nutritional claims that show the ignorance of our food culture. This is when I get to orange juice. It's a great source of vitamin C. So... it's great for pirates so they don't get scurvy. Unfortunately, for you and me, it's just sugar water. Sure, some pulp will give you a trivial amount of fiber (compared to our ancestors who ate a lot of vegetation), but don't miss the orange juice reality: Orange juice is a modern and highly processed version something our ancestors use to eat, metabolically similar to any other sugared drink."}]}
{"id": "5c466t", "input": "Why isn't there so much ancient architecture left in Africa (compared to Europe, America, Asia, etc.)? Was the soil too bad? Because most African tribes were nomads?", "output": [{"answer": "A lot of people have highlighted Egypt and other centres of African heritsge already. But the question is why there's not as much of it, and that IS still a fair question. Africa is a huge continent but there is still a fairly restricted number of extant historical sites that are comparable. The main reason, as.many have pointed out, is the nomadic lifestyle. The same can be found in Australia, and is directly related to the climate in the region. The inability for farming to grow beyond a subsistence level in many areas of the continent is the main reason that a nomadic lifestyle remained prevalent through the ages. Those areas that have built from stone, or even more permanent mud-based bricks in some areas, tend to correlate highly with floodplain areas of large rivers, either with large rich floodplains like Egypt, or a lush forest area that still provides rich fertilisation. The requirements for making larger and more.oermanent structures are quite heavy; often a society would require dedicated craftsmen for both tools and stonework to make quality materials. Those craftsmen can only dedicate to their craft if society can provide for them without them hunting, gathering, herding or subsistence farming. With few exceptions, most areas that develop lasting ancient architecture are those with a temperate climate that support fertile soil, a reliable water supply, and can sustain this for several generations. This allows a society to put down roots in an area, building into a permanent settlement that cultivates larger areas of land more efficiently, providing. A surplus of food that can feed non-food producing workers. Most of Europe, Asia, and south America can provide much of this capacity, as well as the flood plains of predictable large rivers, like the Nile. Access to stone is the final key factor to this, which also tends to be why, despite their pre-disxovery population size, Native Americans lack much ancient architecture. They did in fact build quite large settlements comparable to European cities, however a combination of the preservation of their naturalistic cultural roots, and the additional climate struggles of north-america's varying geography and seasonal extremes, alongside a massive availability of wood, led them to mostly avoid permanent stone buildings. So there you go. The short answer is because Africa is a hot, dry continent in many areas, where people didn't have time to develop crafts not immediately associated with imminent survival, except in a few safe zones."}]}

There's multiple paths to this in terms of reproductive strategies. One strategy, is to maximize the number of offspring, even if that reduces the chances of any particular individual surviving. An alternate strategy is a lower number of offspring, but taking more care to ensure their survival. Dogs are somewhere in the middle, while humans are basically at the far end of the \"fewer offspring\" side. And following those different paths through evolution has resulted in significant biological differences. The human brain is significantly more capable than a dog's, but it also needs much more time to fully develop to the point where you get a human being capable of self preservation and successful reproduction. A wolf (which dogs were bred from) is physically and mentally fit enough to reproduce and care for its offspring within a couple of years of its birth, can create a few litters of puppies, and then get old and die within a decade. Over that same 10 years, a human baby will still not even be developed enough to live on its own, much less create and care for a baby. If you assume about 15 years for a human to develop enough to be in a position to successfully create and care for a child, and then another 15 years for them to care for their child to the point where that child can be independent, then that's 30 years. And that's just for one kid. Before modern medicine came around, children died much more often, so the average mother might give birth to 5+ kids, so you're looking at being 35+ when your last child doesn't need you any longer. And 35 was a pretty typical life expectancy for much of the history of humanity."}]}

Secondly, air is a pretty good insularor and since these garments are relatively wide, you have a layer of air between your body and the fabric that keeps the most intense heat away from your body. Furthermore, your sweat will evaporate and thus cool that air significantly. The cotton then allows the humidity to escape relatively easily. The combination of the loose fit and the light breathing fabric is absolutely killer, although it sounds counter-intuitive at first glance."}]}

The reason they all test \"STD-free\" is because there's no reliable HPV (genital warts) test for men (as far as I know), and HSV-1/HSV-2 (oral / genital herpes) is so common (HSV-1 affects about 75-80% of the population, HSV-2 affects about 1 in 4 women and 1 in 5 men), that they don't include it on the standard STD screening. The standard STD screening mostly screens out those STDs that are fatal (HIV) or treatable (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, etc., etc., etc.). Sorry to ruin the fantasy. (Those of you that are sexually active, when you get STD tested (and you should), you may want to ask for the HSV-1/HSV-2 tests to be included to make sure you're not a passive carrier, as something like 50% of people with HSV have no idea.)"}]}

Other Africans or Westerners? Could you clarify? If you mean selling to Europeans and Americans - you need to remember that you are applying a modern and Western definition of blackness that does not apply to Africa at this time. African nations do not really consider themselves \"Black\" in the American sense. They consider themselves African and whatever nation they come from. This also applied to pre-Atlantic Slave Trade Africa - they were not \"black\", but instead identified based on whatever kingdom or city-state they lived in. Taking this into consideration, Africans were not \"selling their own\" because they did not consider these people their own. They were often selling prisoners of war from rival states. They did not relate with these people. It would be like Italians selling French people into slavery - just because they are both European doesn't mean they consider each other their own. There were also economic and political pressures for African kingdoms to do this. And after the Atlantic Slave Trade boomed - Westerners began to kidnap many Africans instead of buying them directly. The demand for slaves was just so high that Westerners resorted to this and could get away with it. You also need to recognize that these African states did not realize what the Atlantic Slave Trade would entail. They didn't know that people would be chained and packed into slave ships where they would be laying in their own vomit and filth. They did not realize that many of these people would die before even reaching America and that the rest of them would be brutally beaten and dehumanized. American slavery is talked about even today because it was a vile and gruesome form of slavery that was unprecedented at the time. So while, yes, Africans did sell other Africans into Western slavery initially, that does not mean that you can hold them accountable for the atrocities that American slaves lived through."}]}

With the development of the atomic clock in the early 1960s, it was decided to use atomic time as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun. Following several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 \u00b1 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the SI second of atomic time as stated above. This SI second, referred to atomic time, was later verified to be in agreement, within 1 part in 1010, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations (the previous SI for 1 second) Although, for specialized purposes, a second may be used as a unit of time in time scales where the precise length differs slightly from the SI definition. One such time scale is UT1, a form of universal time. The SI second is not the 'legal standard' for timekeeping throughout the world, only that \"over the years UTC [which ticks SI seconds] has become either the basis for legal time of many countries, or accepted as the de facto basis for standard civil time"}]}

If you go to some third-world country and drink the water the locals drink every day, you'll likely get a bad diarrhea. Basically, the water contains lot of bacteria - and your guts aren't used to it. The multitude of new bacteria invades your bowel and proliferates, so your bacterial flora can't work like usual and can't digest properly. Locals flora is used to this horde of strangers, actually, it has lot of them in it so it doesn't get shook so bad. However, most dirty stuff in it is still harmful. Same for animals, it is harmful but they are used to it so they don't get diarrhea from it, at least. But there is a reason why captivated animals live longer than wild ones, they generally end up having safer water and food. Related topic: many animals need less water than we do, to the point that many can avoid drinking raw water altogether. We use lot of water to termoregulate trough sweating and our kidneys don't produce highly concentrated urine, which saves water. Many animals don't sweat or sweat far less (they termoregulate trough respiration, like dogs, or are cold-blooded, like reptiles) and have more efficient kidneys. Also, some animals eat lot more food than us and more watery food (erbivores, for example). Lot of animals are also small enough to make relevant use of natural, pure water sources (a squirrel can get lot of water from a dew covered bush). There is also methabolic water, H2O that comes from chemical reactions, which is more relevant for animals that can save mroe water and animals that have faster metabolisms (small animals)."}]}

You will obviously find greater diversity in places like NYC. The dialect situation in America is very complicated. For example, one of the dialects of New Orleans is the 'yat' dialect, which can trace its ancestry directly to Brooklyn. In general, the **Inland North** is fairly 'standard.' It exhibits the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The **East** and **Northeast** typically resists merging pin/pen, cot/caught, mary/merry/marry. As a result they have more vowel variation. Some NE dialects are non-rhotic and nasal. You will find larger differences between individual states here. The **Midlands** have some diversity, like in Ohio/Indiana... I'm not familiar with them. The **South** has a good deal of diversity, but most dialects are characterized by the Southern Cities Vowel Shift. Some also have drawls, where an extra schwa vowel (uh) is added after glides. Some dialects have double negatives. Again, there is sometimes non-rhoticism. The **North Central** typically merges the vowels I mentioned resisted by the NE accents. This accent is on the UP of Michigan, and northern WI/MN. They have strong rhotics and unreleased final consonants. \"bag/flag/tag\" are pronounced \"beyg,fleyg,teyg.\" I believe there is a California Vowel Shift as well, but everything west of the Mississippi river is a mystery to me. Some dialects round their lips when pronouncing \"sh\" and \"r\" but I don't know who does/doesn't. **Caveat: Do not confuse vowel sounds with vowel letters. Our alphabet has 5 vowels, but the alphabet is irrelevant. Most Americans have 10-12 vowel phonemes, not counting diphthongs.**"}]}

None of them comprehend anything they just switch exactly like their build to switch. And we engineers just set them up i a way that solves math and simple logic problems. You can basically break it all down to AND and OR. Probably the simplest logic question is, is this switch turned on? To solve that problem you just need a single switch and some way to show whether or not it's turned on, usually a small lamp or a screen. Simple. And you basically build up fom there. Want to know when two switches are turned on? Just put two switches in a row. Now if you interpret this circuit as calculator you can interpret a turned on switch as 1 and the output led is part of the result switch 1 + switch 2, if both are turned on (1) the result led glows that means the answer to your calculation is 2. A problem is that if the light doesn't go on you only know that the result is either 0 or 1. Not that great so you have to build another circuit that makes a lamp turn on when any of the switches is turned on. Not that hard either just take two wires and two swtiches and connect them both to the lamp. Doesn't matter with switch is turned on a light will go on. It will only stay off if both switches are turned off. So now you have two result LEDs. One turns on if both switches are turned on (AND circuit) and one circuit makes a led glow when one or both of the switches are turned on (OR circuit). If the AND circuit glows the result is 2, doesn't matter what the other circuit does. If it doesn't turn on you have to check the second circuit is it on? The result is 1, is it off the result is 0. And from here you just keep going and make it more and more complex. It helps that there's already math that works with only 0 and 1 so you just learn that and keep building bigger and bigger circuits. Turns out you can break down almost all problems into a combination of AND, OR and NOT problems. Which is great. But this is on a very low level so usually if you look at a computer you just ignore that part and look at the big circuit that adds 8 bit numbers. You now it adds but you ignore how all the AND, OR and NOT circuits are connected because even for a simple addition you need tons of them."}]}
{"id": "6punjq", "input": "Sharks, crocodiles etc. When they eat in the water their prey, where does all the water goes when they swallow? Do they somehow filter meat from water or do they just swallow it all?", "output": [{"answer": "As others have said, crocodiles have a false palate to avoid too much water in, but they still swallow amounts of water (they don't wait for the food or even their mouth to drain before swallowing). Think of when you eat meat in broth or soup. As for sharks and if they would ask if humans eat air, it's actually true. We ingest air which is why we burp, especially when eating fast (it's not all stomach gases like cows and methane). Moms have to make babies burp because they ingest air, and if people want to force a burp, you need to swallow air. In fact we also get water from food. It depends on the food content because some food needs water to be digested, but there are some desert rodents that get all their water from the food they eat (seeds, insects etc). The point is that food and water consumption are not separate. ~~There~~ The body doesn't go into \"food mode\" then \"water mode\", but our digestive systems separate them. Edit1: There/The Edit2: To clarify about 'water burps', that was to explain the comments about 'eating air' in humans. Adding much more detail, trying to keep it Eli5: Crocodiles, as humans, could get water into their lungs when eating. Humans avoid this when swallowing, when our tongue and other muscles close the way to the thrachea (airway) while letting food and water into the oesophagus (let's say 'foodway'), but we can still breathe while chewing. Crocodiles, as OP asked, need to bite underwater which would mean water getting into their lungs. That's why they have the palatal valve, like a trapdoor, but it actually closes both airway and foodway. This helps while biting (they don't chew, they break off chunks small enough to swallow), but they need to get out of the water to open the palatal valve and swallow. Bonus fact, they have a special tube from the nostrils to the airway, letting them breathe even with the palatal valve closed, like a snorkel. They can close their nostrils when swimming. Sharks of course don't breathe air, and they don't have lungs. They get oxygen by getting water though their mouth (and spiracle, a hole behind the eyes) and filtering the oxygen then throwing water out through the gills. They actually need water getting into their mouth to survive and many species need to move to help this. When they eat they just take water in as usual, and some goes to their stomach, becoming part of what they digest and then expel. Like others said, [urea in sharks keeps water concentration in their body balances with the sea water so they don't need to 'drink' as other fish do]( URL_0 ). If we keep talking about water burps then these would be when they expel water through their gills, although sharks can vomit and even turn their stomach inside out to clear it (you can search shark stomach eversion)."}]}

Sheep are one of those species. Prior to domestication sheep would have grown a much smaller amount of wool up to the point where it served their needs, like the hair on a bear or a wolf. It doesn't grow indefinitely. Then humans came along and found these relatively docile sheep sitting around and someone realised their wool was very useful to make things like clothing out of. Over many generations humans captured and bred these sheep to harvest their wool from. Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents. By repeating this process over time we ended up with the types of sheep we have today, who are completely reliant on humans to regularly shear them and remove the wool. This is domestication and selective breeding. Without us they would suffer many problems like overheating and being far too heavy."}]}
{"id": "2rqi4r", "input": "Why did Mohammad marry a 6 year old?", "output": [{"answer": "Historical records can be spotty. There are diagreements about her age. The most generous view is that she was married at 9 years old, which is what I heard originally, and she had sex at age 12. This is what I believe. So, my simplest explanation for this behavior is: 1. Morality changes based on the conditions in which a society lives. When circumstance changes, generally speaking, so does morality, or what is acceptable, and not acceptable. For example, it's generally thought of as cruel to kill another person. However, when they are threatened the views change, and then it turns into \"self defense.\" Morality, or what we call morality, is not rigid, or fixed. 2. People didn't live as long back then. Dying younger was very common. There was no saving anything for the future. It was do it today or never. However, it should be noted that the low average life span was due to babies dying. But in terms of how society perceived their own longevity that is the most important part. If people thought they would die in their 40s that is a rather short time to live. Therefore people would be more pressed to do things that they would think beneficial, including marrying earlier, and having a family. 3. Giving birth was no easy task. It isn't now, but today in a proper hospital you will generally come out alive. Back then birth was an extremely perilous task. It was of crucial importance a woman, or girl rather, be in the best shape to give birth; otherwise, that would result in her death. So, it was the general view that a young girl would be best suited to have a baby. 4. Men often went to war and died, or were involved in deadly conflict. That meant a woman could be left as a widower, which would have devastating consequences. If she was too old, somewhat like today, that meant she could not get remarried and/or be capable of taking care of her child. Therefore, having a child at a younger age would be beneficial. Imagien that you had a baby when 12, and then your husband died, 10 years later. You'd still be attractive at 22 years old. Nowadays many people have babies at age 30. But imagine that 10 years passed. Then she would be 40. No problem today, right? Because a woman can earn. But back then that was not the case. A woman could not earn for herself. So the idea that women marry young was largely perpetuated by sexism, and inequality."}]}
{"id": "41fyvp", "input": "if copper is too toxic to use as a spoon, then why is it's safe to have implanted an an IUD without toxic side effects", "output": [{"answer": "This has two parts that we need to look at. First part: the difference between things entering the mouth, and things entering the vagina/uterus. Second part: copper toxicity. **Difference between things entering the mouth and things entering the vagina** Things entering the mouth are exposed to: digestive enzymes, stomach acid, bile (basic solution compared to stomach acid), lots of absorptive surfaces, water, and most importantly, time and lots of mixing/churning. Things entering the vagina are exposed to a less acidic environment compared to the stomach, basically none of the enzymes, less mixing/churning, and are basically never submerged in liquid for very long. Additionally, although stuff can be absorbed through the blood vessels in the female reproductive system, this is nothing compared to the stomach and intestines. Another thing to think about with the acidity is that stomach acid is between 1.5 and 3.5 (3.5 will be with lots of food in the stomach, neutralizing the acid). The vagina should have a pH of 3.8 to 4.5, but can be a little higher or lower if they have a vaginal infection. Remember pH is on a logarithmic scale, so the difference between a full person's stomach contents with a pH of 3.5 and a healthy woman's vagina with a pH of 4.5 if actually 10-fold. Meaning, the stomach acid is 10 times more acidic than the vagina. If they had more acid and less food, and had a pH of 2.5, then their stomach is actually 100-times more acidic. Then, once food leaves the stomach, its exposed to bile, with a pH of 5.5 to 6, usually. That quick reversal of pH protects the sensitive intestines from stomach acid, but it also further helps digestion, because some stuff dissolves better in more basic conditions. Giving the food a deadly one-two punch. So, eaten copper is exposed to a much harsher environment than a copper IUD, and the ratio of \"amount you put in the body to amount in the blood\" will be higher for eaten copper than the copper IUD. **How much copper is even toxic?** The dose that kills half of the rats exposed to it (LD50 in science/med-speak), for copper, is 30mg/kg. So, assuming a 70-kg (~145 lb) adult human... 2.1 g of copper could be enough to kill you, and it would definitely make you very sick. The level in US drinking water is supposed to stay below 1.3 mg/L. If you're getting copper from other places in your diet, though (even aside from the spoon), it could build up. Copper tends to form salts, especially with acidic foods, which are pretty easily eaten and absorbed, so if you're worried, I'd keep that in mind. **My two cents** I don't think I'd be worried unless I also had a copper IUD, was cooking with copper pots/pans, and/or drank everything from a copper mug."}]}

Think of it like a wet carpet that has miniature water sprinklers, if you will. The function of such an arrangement is to make sure that the air reaching your lungs is not dry (which would in turn make your lungs dry, which is dangerous), amongst other things. Come winter, and a large number of viruses find it a very conducive environment to harbour themselves in your nasal mucous membrane. These in turn cause the glands secreting the mucus (the miniature water sprinklers) to work overtime. The purpose of this is to wash out the virus, broadly speaking. But as a result of this, mucus is produced in excess. When you're awake, this dribbles down the back of your throat due to gravity, not making its presence felt for the most part. When you're asleep, it becomes difficult for this to happen. So, it accumulates and dries up. This is why you get a clogged nasal passage. Another reason is that the miniature arteries carrying blood to the mucous membrane dilate themselves in response to the infection. This swells up the mucosa, giving you a sensation of a stuffed nose. Not exactly the most comprehensive explanation, but hope it helps."}]}

My assistant 99 times out of a 100 is the one who types the prescription and counts the actual pills. Common physical things I catch are wrong doses (2.5 mg instead of 25mg), wrong drugs (doxycycline-an antibiotic to be avoided in pregnancy vs doxylamine a morning sickness pill) and illegal prescriptions (narcotic forgeries). Some trained technicians can perform this step but IMO the above are easier to spot with pharmacist training. - Check prescriptions for \"drug related problems\" such as interactions. In my experience, pharmacists tend to be overly cautious people. So yes, we will run certain drug combos through our computer, or glance at the patient hand-out to \"double check\" ourselves-this is a good thing. Sometimes I need to remind myself of a drug I haven't seen in a long time! Once we get the information we can interpret its severity quickly, which a lay person could not. As others have pointed out, there are tons of interactions that get \"flagged\" and a pharmacist is able to determine which is important based on the individual patient. For example, I have prevented very serious problems by contacting doctors over a dangerously high dose of antibiotics in a child, or a drug interaction that was only meaningful because it was for a frail elderly lady. This is a pharmacist's job-doctors are trained for diagnosis, not drug interactions. - I help people understand their medications. For example, the man who just had a heart attack and is leaving the hospital overwhelmed with a pile of meds. Without me they usually will stop taking one or two (or go back to smoking, or try a over-the-counter snake oil instead) and be at risk for a second heart attack. I sit down with them, and based on their personal needs talk about the risks vs benefits of the meds. Then I call them in a few days and follow up, making sure they've made an appointment with their family doctor. Or, I do a medication reconciliation with an elderly woman who has too many medications with side effects, and work with her doctor to see if some can be stopped. - I answer people's questions 24 hours a day with more accuracy and clarity than google. (We are open extended hours) For example- its 2 AM and someone comes in with a sick child: what medication do they use? Should they go to the ER? This saves the healthcare system (or you, if you're American) money. - I give flu shots which saves the government money as they pay us less than doctors, and the patient time. I also give other vaccinations, such as hepatitis B, so if you're going to Mexico you can be protected without the need for extra doctor visits. - I prescribe certain medications for minor conditions, again saving the healthcare system money and the patient time. - I can change some prescriptions with the patient's ok, for example if a product isn't available or something is missing from the prescription. - I specialty make a lot of drugs, for example certain seizure medication for children isn't sold in liquid form- I will make this for you at 3AM when you realize you are completely out of doses for your kid. - I dispense and monitor methadone, helping former addicts come off narcotics and re-integrate back in society (in partnership with their awesome nurses.) - I deal with insurance agencies to try to get medications covered, sometimes contacting your doctor to see if an alternate drug would be acceptable. - I consult on the phone with doctors, nurses, homecare workers etc deciding what course of action would be in the best interest of the patient. - I use math calculations to be able to figure out the correct dose of things like Tylenol for infants too small to be listed on the box, again at 2 AM. Or help someone self-adjust their insulin. - I get annoyed when someone is yelling at me from across the counter wondering why their order isn't done yet, asking what the heck I do all day. ;) TL;DR: Pharmacist's are drug therapy experts who can help you take charge of your health and decide if a certain medication is right for you.

Judges enforce and interpret laws. A liberal judge can be asked to rule on the legal proceedings in a conservative area, and vice versa. Judges are required to uphold laws that they disagree with. Secondly, it's really hard to determine where a judge falls even after the fact. A good example of a justice in this case would be Sandra Day O'Connor. She sided with the conservative branches of the court many times in issues involving affirmative action, campaign finance, voting rights, education reform, and first amendment protections. However, she generally (though not universally) opposed abortion restrictions, before her appointment, throughout her career, and afterwards. While that's only a single issue, it's a big one. On other issues, she's a conservative, and she was a Reagan appointee (his first appointee, to be specific). We generally think of her as a moderate today, not because of her ideology, but because later appointments were more polarized, leaving her to effectively function as swing vote in the early 2000s. That wasn't something that had been true about her position over time. If you go by the data, [from 1994, to 2004, in 5-4 decisions, she sided with the conservative bloc 82 times, and the liberal block 28 times]( URL_1 ). That isn't moderate. That's pretty solidly conservative....for a justice that was often facing criticism by conservatives, and still does. Nobody would agree on her position in this respect. Moderate? Conservative? Who's to say? And at which year we would examine to determine it. The reason she's in this quirky position is largely because of point #2: 2 - Liberalism and conservatism aren't neat little packages. Take a libertarian judge. A libertarian is generally described as somebody who advocates economic measures like lower taxes (or the abolition of taxes altogether) and less government interference and intrusion--economic conservatism--but also generally oppose restrictions on private matters like abortion, marriage, adoption, immigration status, etc--social liberalism. Such a person doesn't fit in either box, but he also couldn't properly be called a moderate. More examples outside of the Libertarians? The Unity Party. Log Cabin Republicans (they dissent from the Republicans on many social issues, not just the LGBT ones, and they take no position on abortion as a whole). Modern Whigs. The Faith and Family Left. The American Solidarity Party. These groups don't fit the mold because political beliefs are more complicated and nuanced than a single continuum captures. 3 - The meanings change over time. Liberalism once denoted freedom from government interference; libertarians correctly point out that they believe in the *original* meaning of the term, not what it became over time. Back in the 1960s, the Republicans, despite being economically conservative, supported expanding civil rights. The Civil Rights Act actually [passed with more Republican support than Democratic support]( URL_0 )...yet we definitely see this as a liberal issue. Meanings change. The only beef for a minority of the Republicans? They didn't want to force businesses to serve everybody, thinking that a store owner should be able to refuse services to anybody as they see fit; that's definitely a conservative position on both property rights and economics...but they put that aside for an issue that we would now call a very liberal notion. A judge might be elected on an ideology, but if the ideology changes its specific supports, the judge may not be on board, and thus be seen as no longer fitting the partisan mold. EDIT: Grammar"}]}
{"id": "19jyp2", "input": "How did South Korea go from being a completely backwards and impoverished nation to one of the world's top economies in 60 years?", "output": [{"answer": "Here is what I know. Up till the 60's North Korea was far better developed compared to South Korea due to the backing of the Soviet Union and China. Since South Korea's first President Rhee Syng-man, South Korea was politically very unstable. South Korea was backed by the U.S. ,but if you know you're history. There was a lot going on in America in the 60's: Cuban missile crisis, civil rights movement, JFK assassination, space race, Vietnam war, and etc. So that is where Park Chung-hee comes in picture. On May 16, 1961, then Major-General Park and his military allies launch a military coup. The coup was successful and even the U.S. government recognized the new government. Park then won the election in 1963 and served as President 6 terms till his assassination in 1979. Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea like a dictator with laws: not allowing men to grow out hair, women can't wear miniskirts, curfew, and etc. Having a KGB type state police that would arrest/kidnap people torture and/or killing them, if they had a plot against the government or were linked to North Korea. Park's decision to work with Japan was very unpopular. Korea was only freed from Japan rule 20 decades then. Park was actually an officer in the Manchukuo Army. Park and his military/government allies were all fluent in Japanese. However this Japanese relationship is what helped South Korea rapidly grow. Park's government introduced Chaebol ideology, which comes from Japan. Where a company does only work in one industry, but are intertwined in multiple industry. Hyundai is a good example. Hyundai cars are made in Hyundai factories, transported on Hyundai trucks, transported on Hyundai freighter and sold overseas. Park introduced the Five-Year Plans of South Korea. Park's government also helped created the freeway, which really helped by connecting the capital, Seoul to Busan/Pohang a port city. Park also kept a close relationship with the U.S. government. Even sending 320k troops to Vietnam during the war and being vocal against Communistism and North Korea. Park even went to the extremes by sending small number of troops into North Korea without the approval from the U.S. Through aid during Vietnam war, U.S. government aided South Korea with tens of millions dollars from funding, technology transfer, investment, loans, grants and etc. So here you have Park Chung-hee who left a very odd legacy. A dictator in one hand, but without him South Korea would be very different now. By the way Park Chung-hee's daughter ,Park Geun Hye was just elected as South Korea's first female President."}]}

There exists no technical justification for them. They are 100% arbitrary. - ***Muh spectrum though?*** Spectrum is limited, both on cable and mobile networks, more on the latter. This means the total effective bandwidth on any network is limited, and as a result, the bandwidth for users. Quite logical. A common myth is that this would justify data caps. It does not. Spectrum doesn't limit the total amount of data you can download. Only the *rate* or speed at which you can download. - ***Muh congestion though?*** Another common myth is the one about congestion. People try to justify data caps because otherwise, due to overselling (the ISP selling more bandwidth than they can offer since not everyone uses the network 24/7), congestion would occur because too many people would download too much at once. However, congestion means saturating the network bandwidth, so that by itself is more a spectrum issue than a data issue - data caps do not prevent congestion at all. It's still possible for people to log on at the same time and overload the network. Data caps instead serve to prohibit users from connecting to the internet. Congestion is also already solved by dynamic bandwidth adjustment, which is a fancy way of saying the ISP temporarily (on the scale of seconds to minutes) reduces the bandwidth for some users to prevent congestion. So, it doesn't occur anymore - the worst thing that could happen is a temporary slower internet. You don't notice this with normal usage. Data caps, on the other hand, prevent usage of internet altogether. I mean, this is not a difficult comparison: 'Slow' Internet versus no Internet. Easy choice right? Someone will inevitably argue against this, then I'll present a simple calculation to destroy them. The fact is that you're able to get far, far more data (hundreds of times more data) without data caps with congestion, than with data caps without congestion. And as for the latter - even on capped connections, congestion still occurs. - ***M-muh money?*** Well yeah, that's the point. The ISP wants more money. That's why they do it. - ***But they have to earn back the costs for maintenance and such!*** Yes... so? Doesn't justify data caps. It would justify either increasing the price of connections - which is already high enough anyway, it's a total lie that they don't have enough money - or to reduce bandwidth. - ***If everyone has unlimited data, something something Netflix something something congestion!*** See the big rant about congestion above. And if the network couldn't ultimately handle an increase in, say, streaming - the solution is not to make users pay more or to make them less able to use the Internet. The solution is to improve the network to enable users to stream that much. Shitty analogy time: If there are congestions on highways, does that justify forbidding people from driving 6 days per week? (Fun fact: 1/7th is still way more than you'll get with data caps, so it's not an extreme example. It's a mild one.) - ***[Insert argument in favor of data caps]*** [Insert rebuttal of argument that is probably not justifying data caps at all.]"}]}

To give violin as an example (because the situation is a bit more complex for cello), composers think about how their material is going to fit into various standard \"positions\" - if they want to write a fast passage that the instrumentalists will have to learn at speed, or sight read, they have to rely on stock figurations that fall conveniently within one of the standard positions, to minimise shifts up and down. Over time the anchor location of these positions becomes second nature and violinists can just look at a long sequence of notes and figure out how they are going to finger it in the most efficient way.

This is definitely not real money. But you want convenience of a modern system designed to be used online. Also, savings, do you store bank notes under your mattress? Or maybe gold?

Once you leave the protection of the Earth's magnetic field, you begin to die of radiation exposure. Just a \"fast\" trip to Mars is enough to significantly increase your risk of developing cancer. To live on Mars full-time, you'd need shielded habitats, covered in, say, a meter of concrete. But how do you intend to BUILD those habitats? Schlep cranes and bulldozers to Mars? And how do you propose to shield people when they go outside (or when they're building the habitat)? A shielded habitat also means no windows to look out of and no sunlight coming in. Hope you brought lotsa Grow Lights or a fuckton of vitamin D. Actually, even full Martian daylight doesn't contain enough sunlight to be healthy to humans. --The atmosphere. Mainly CO2, very low pressure. A colony will need air. Now, if you have plenty of water, and plenty of energy (solar power probably ain't gonna cut it here, that's a whole other can-o-worms), you can break water down into hydrogen and oxygen...but air is almost 80% nitrogen, and that's something Mars is noticeably short on. The ISS requires regular resupply of both oxygen and nitrogen, but that's low Earth orbit we're talking, not Mars (and oh yeah, by the way, for practical reasons, you can only launch a vehicle to Mars from Earth about every two years). --The gravity. The gravity of Mars is only about 38% that of Earth, so long-term colonists are going to find that they lose significant muscle and bone mass, even with exercise. We have no idea what the long-term effects of living in reduced gravity are. --The soil. You wanna grow food in dirt on Mars? Then it sucks to be you. The soil on Mars contains toxic levels of perchlorates. That's good news if you want to open a planet-wide chain of dry cleaning stores, not so much if you wanna live with the stuff. Be careful not to track any back into the habitat when you go outside (to, um, frolic in the deadly radiation), because that shit will start to build up in the atmospheric system. For a permanent colony, keeping it from building up in the habitat is essentially impossible. --The habitat. We simply don't know how to build a self-sustaining habitat on Earth, let alone someplace where the environment wants us dead. Not a clue. We don't even know *for sure* that it's possible on a small scale. Resupplying a small colony, let alone a large one, from Earth would be ruinously expensive, and perhaps not even technically feasible. And those are just the big ones. On top of all this, howzabout a reason it SHOULDN'T be done? I mean, aside from the obvious that it would cost hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, yet serve no useful purpose beyond the gee-whiz factor (we can do the science for about a *tenth* of the cost with robots). Contamination. We have had a few tantalizing clues about past or even current life on Mars, but the moment we plant the first muddy human bootprint there, it's game over for science. It's hard enough to sterilize a robot without reducing it to a pile of ash, but people are walking contamination machines. It is simply not possible to put people there and NOT hopelessly contaminate the environment. After that moment, any discovery made of life on Mars would come with built-in doubt about whether it was pristine, or the result of Earth contamination."}]}

Hundreds of thousands of parents worldwide now mistrusted a lifesaving vaccine, and as a result thousands of children suffered and died as a result. He is lower than sh*t in the scientific community. There's always risks with vaccines, unfortunately there is no magic shot that cures you with no complications. The reason you should get vaccinated is the benefit outweighs the risks. Here's an excellent example: ever wonder why the smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine is no longer used? Two reasons: it's officially eradicated, but also there was a risk of complications from it. When it was administered, smallpox was such a horrific, deadly disease that it didn't matter, but now the risk of getting smallpox is so negligible, there's no point in the potential risk of complications from the vaccine, so it isn't given except to members of the military or if you have a specific need. Another example is with the flu shot you may feel sick (but not actually be sick), but you'll be protected from the flu. Autism simply is not a risk from MMR or any vaccines, though."}]}
{"id": "5q0c8x", "input": "How can the President sign all these executive orders without approval? What's to stop them from making all their campaign promises and their party's agenda into executive orders?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm a presidency scholar, so I can answer this pretty well. In inhibiting executive action, there are four really key things. The first is that the POTUS is not the Executive. By that I mean that the man signs the thing, but the institution must do any of the actions. If, for instance, Trump wakes up cranky and decides, by executive order, to have arrested on sight anyone who makes fun of him, many will simply not do it. Their reasons for disobedience will vary from moral to legal arguments, but many will not. It wasn't an order, rather a firing, but this scared Truman shitless when he wanted to fire MacArthur. Second, there is Congress. Congress can pass law contravening Executive orders, in which case the law takes precedent. Congress can also de-fund offices, projects, etc. that try to do the will of POTUS. So if, for instance, Trump decides we should not do trade deals, but congress signs laws mandating him to do so, we'd be headed in the direction of #3... Third, there is the Supreme Court. If someone sues POTUS for doing something wildly illegal (for instance, violating the fourth amendment by requiring us all to wear ID badges indicating citizenship status), SCOTUS would then decide the issue. Fourth is political expediency. In the past, presidents would have rather used orders sparingly; they really piss off Congress and have the nasty attribute of being tied to the man himself very, very directly. This may be lessened if, for instance, the POTUS has no idea what political capital is and is already willing to simply ignore congress. This, I think, is the most common but hardest to study insomuch that it is the non-event, the deed that gets done without order that matters here. More orders happen under divided government or when the party in power has no one single mind on an issue: executive orders are a desperate tool to try to get something done when the normal legislating process works. I am willing to make the scholarly argument that Obama had to use so many for the sole reason that the modern GOP would have filibustered everything Obama wanted, even if it was a proposal for a bill to have the floors waxed in the Senate to keep the building nice."}]}
{"id": "6m6bc0", "input": "What makes us legally bound to follow the law, even though we have never formally signed a contract or agreed to it like you would read and agree to the TOS for a game?", "output": [{"answer": "There's an entire field of philosophy called Social Contract dedicated to this thats as old as the field itself. It goes back thousands of years to Socrates, though it didnt really gain momentum until the 'modern' era (1500s-1700s). Like all of philosophy, it gives possible reasons but no \"100% true\" answers. A very, very brief (to the point of possibly being interpreted inaccurately) breakdown of some of the well known theories: * Socrates (Crito) - at some point, he chose to live in the society of Athens. By choosing to live in Athens instead of leaving, he implicitly agreed to follow the Law of Athens, since he always had the choice to leave. Socrates might say something like, \"You chose to live in Canada, be a Canadian citizen, enter into contracts protected by Canadian law, and benefit from the Canadian law. Therefore, youre bound by that choice - even if you want to break it\" * Hobbes - people are rational and people will act in their best interest. The 'original' way of living was the 'State of Nature' - kill or be killed, everything goes, and no morality or laws (since it was kill or be killed). But because people are rational and want to live outside such a brutal world, we came to the conclusion that giving up some of their freedoms to a sovereign will be better for their lives as a whole. He doesnt say this is exactly how it went down, but this is the reason why societies existed and why we derive our morals from the laws - we want to escape the State of Nature, so we internalize the laws of the society to become 'justice' and 'morals'. Hobbes might say something like, \"Living in Canada is better than living in the state of nature. Even if that means being bound by laws you never agreed to or never learned, anything is better than the State of Nature\". * Rawls (contemporary philosophy) - he goes through a thought experiment about 'Behind the Veil of Ignorance'. Basically, imagine yourself creating a society, but you dont know where you will eventually fall. You dont know if you will be male or female, rich or poor, what ethnicity you will be, etc. He that this \"original person\" will act in their own self interest - and because of that, there is no reason to give power to one side over another. You wouldnt give males more power than females, because you dont know if you would be male or female. Therefore, the \"original person\" would want a society thats fair for all sides, and this is from this position that morality and justice come from. He might say something like this, \"If you were behind the Veil of Ignorance you wouldnt know if you were the one wanting to kill or you were the one being killed. Therefore, you would want a set of laws thats fair for both sides - in this case, you would rather give up your freedom to kill but protect yourself from being killed.\" TL;DR Philosophy tries to answer this question in different ways, but at some point either implicitly or explicitly, you decided to follow the law and live with others who follow the law. You never signed anything saying you wont kill people, but you agreed to it - you dont kill people and people dont kill you. If you dont like that agreement, you can leave the society and all its protections or break the law and get punished for it. Edit-formatting"}]}

{"id": "5jogr3", "input": "Why is reverse-racism/reverse-sexism not the same as regular racism/sexism?", "output": [{"answer": "The way it's been explained to me, and this has caused rifts among me and some friends, is that racism is a complex and wide-spanning systematic effort of the government, culture, and a general way of thinking. This I can agree with, I won't deny that the system has been rigged against minorities for decades. But what I consider to be racism is simply treating someone differently because of their race. I'm not talking like, buying SPF100 for your white friends, which is probably aside from genetic medical conditions the only context in which I believe race matters. I mean, if you look at someone and treat them differently than you would treat someone of a different this or that, it's unnecessary bias to be categorized accordingly (racism, sexism, -phobias). However, some of the more far left don't see it this way. Because the system was designed to cater to white people, especially people with more money, since other races and people with less money have less opportunities, the system disadvantages them and is therefore racist against them. Because of the system failing to prevent these challenges to the rich whites, this racism does not exist for them, prompting people to claim that you cannot be racist against white people. I find the logic a bit convoluted but stick with me. Let me use myself and my partner as examples. I'm Latina. My father was an immigrant, but my mother is white. Because of this, I look white and have never experienced someone stereotyping me based on what they see, so I safely say I have not experienced racism. Since I am still Hispanic, and my parents are suburbanites (middle class) I had opportunities a lot of people never did. I was well educated and was designated a National Hispanic Scholar because of this, and in turn received auto-admission to a lot of colleges and a full tuition scholarship. My partner, on the other hand, is a cis, straight, white male, from a lower tax bracket than me. The university I go to has a whopping 80% acceptance rate. Despite having average grades, because he was a poor, white male, he was not admitted. This of course begs the question, did the system favor me for being a minority and scorn him for being white? I will fully admit that I have led an easy life. I get the benefit of being Hispanic (scholarship, national recognition) without ever having any of the drawbacks of being exposed to racism. Doesn't seem fair, does it? I recognize that this particular case could very well be an exception to the rule but it's hard to base racism off of the system when the system changes who it favors depending on the situation. That's why I don't believe people when they say reverse racism doesn't exist. It may not be as enforced by society as racism towards minorities, but it is still treating someone poorly based on race. I think you can disagree on what to call it all day long, but the underlying message needs to be that IT IS A SHITTY THING TO DO."}]}

Rodman has met quite a few NK people, and been seen by many thousands. The NK people (only some of them) now have to process that people can look like that, behave like that. Its a shocking experience I am sure. We should not underestimate the importance of these events. Rodman is an ambassador of sports sure, but also of American culture. What he is not is a directly political ambassador. I think it is awesome that these exchanges takes place.

{"id": "33q55y", "input": "Sunlight takes 8 minutes yo get to Earth but in the perspective of light how long would it take to get to Earth?", "output": [{"answer": "Something traveling very incredibly close to the speed of light from Earth's perspective would experience less and less time. There is no lower limit to the amount of time that they would experience, except for the fact that they would experience some time. If they experienced no time passing at all, then at a single point in time, they would be in multiple places. ie: t=0 you are at point A, t=0 you are at point B, at t=0, where are you? As you approach the speed of light from another observer's perspective, the time you experience relative to them decreases (if you were to go and meet up with the observer, where the observer doesn't go accelerating off in the interim) But since you can't reach the speed of light, you can't really say what happens if you get there, because getting there doesn't really make sense. Ultimately what reaching the speed of light would mean, would be that you stopped moving. Because moving would mean traveling some distance over time, and time would no longer exist. It would mean that this mass would be everywhere at once, which can't even make sense because matter is composite and it has forces that don't really make sense. For instance, matter gets held together by forces that act on it over time, gravity pulls mass together over time, electromagnetism attracts or repels based on charge over time, but that relies on some timeline. If you're at A then at B, these forces affect you at your configuration at A, and then affect you at your configuration at B. But if you're at point A and point B without some progression of time, so there's no A then B, then what? Does A experience any of these forces at all? Do forces from you at B affect you while you're at A? It ultimately doesn't make any sense at all. Now if it's a photon it does make sense, because it plays by different rules. It doesn't interact with near as much, it is allowed to act like it's in multiple places at once, and when you think it is everywhere on its path at once, some of the experiments like the dual slit experiment or the quantum eraser experiment make intuitive sense. But then you have to stop kind of thinking of light traveling at a speed at all. It definitely has a direction, but it propagates without time, and the fact that we see it travel in time is more because we see it travel through space and we experience time. It's like asking how the volume of a cube drawn on paper is. It doesn't really make sense. It definitely looks like a cube when we look at it, so why can't we get a volume? Say we have a cube made out of clay, we know the volume of the cube and we can flatten it so that it looks the same shape as its outline we drew on the paper. We know that the volume stays the same when we flatten it. When we flatten it it seems like it gets closer to the height of the cube on the paper (0). We keep flattening it trying to get it closer and closer to the height of its outline. We ultimately get it to the point where it's a 1 molecule high film over the paper, but still that's taller than the space indicated by the outline, so we even imagine what would happen if we could keep flattening it out even thinner, and the flattened cube starts to have an area that reaches infinity. But this doesn't tell us anything about the volume of the 2d projection indicated by the outline. It's not because we don't know how to flatten a cube well enough to figure it out. It's because while a 2d projection might resemble what a 3d object looks like to our eyes, it simply doesn't have a volume. So light doesn't have a speed, because light doesn't exist in the dimension of time. It looks to us like it exists in time, just like it looks to us that a drawing of a cube is 3 dimensional, but like the way that the angles on a paper give us the perception of depth, intervals in space give us a perception of time. This is why spacetime is spacetime and not space and time. Since light doesn't experience time, it doesn't take an instant, because that would mean that there was some experience of time. It's like saying a square is an incredibly shallow cube. It's not a cube, it's a square, it doesn't have that dimension. You can't squash a cube into the shape of a square."}]}

At any time, you can go to your bank, or use a debit card, to withdraw some or all of your money. Usually, banks also pay you for your money by giving you interest. Years ago, that was it. Today, it's a little more complicated. Banks also charge you fees for using your accounts in different ways, and they offer several different kinds of accounts - some are designed to be used frequently, others for saving. Some let you write personal cheques, others don't. Some are online only! All of them offer some sort of interest rate, though. So how can a bank afford to pay you interest? The bank lends 90% of your money to other people, and charges them _more_ interest than they pay you. Assuming most people pay them back, they earn much more money than they need (and they lend it out again). There are two ways banks can fail. One way is for banks to lend a lot of money to people who don't pay it back. Too many bad loans and the bank will have money problems. The second way is for too many people to withdraw their money at the same time - called a \"run on the banks\". Remember when I said the banks lend 90% of your money to other people? They do that with everyone's accounts. That means that if a LOT of people started asking for their money, the banks wouldn't actually have the money on hand, and people would lose confidence in the bank. That's bad."}]}

For instance weve all been blinded by the sun and unable to see an object, well a digital camera can focus and take a clear photo of the sun but the object is not properly exposed and looks terrible, or it can focus and take a clear photo of the object but the sun isn't expose properly. Using Photoshop, you could combine these two images and get a single photo where the object and sun are properly exposed even tho we could never really see it like that in real life."}]}

Whilst a number of the stronger entities in the Empire changed the title of their rulers to king and most of the rest got gobbled up by these new kingdoms; Lichtenstein was too weak to promote itself and avoided getting eaten. Eventually most of the rest of Germany united to form modern Germany; but again Lichtenstein managed to avoid getting absorbed so it remains a modern state with a ruling prince. Just to be clear prince is a translation of Furst. It doesn't mean the same thing as the modern english definition of prince (ie male relative of royalty). Whilst there were a number of things that used the various forms of the title; generally it referred to something between a count (graf) and a Duke (Herzog)."}]}

But historically, when USSR collapsed, many state-owned industries like oil or mineral mines were privatized and granted to high-ranking party members (incl Putin, kgb) and he and many other oligarchs capitalized on their newfound wealth and power by working together politically to protect their assets. After decades of continued corruption, consolidation, and cooperation, the oligarchs still control Russia. Putin may be singular in his wealth and power, but there are many of his ilk, who thrive under his protection, and so his reign is very stable. He may or may not be the worlds best blackmail artist, and was known even early in his career for his cunning. This collectively silenced opposition that wasn\u2019t outright destroyed by his police and military forces (see Ukraine). As far as the question of trump and collusion, I believe DT may feasibly be an unwitting agent of Putin, handled by multiple advisors with more direct connections to the kremlin. There are many dirty fingerprints on his administration and our nations\u2019 politics, and indictments have already happened in relation to the ongoing investigation. DT is an easy candidate for manipulation because of his defiant compulsions and egomaniacal worldview. Putin\u2019s take from winning this hand is a USA too distracted internally to continue to progress technologically, culturally, etc, while other countries grow."}]}
{"id": "58a63d", "input": "I'm not American, what can someone do with your social security number and why you have to keep it secret?", "output": [{"answer": "Let\u2019s start from the beginning. What is a social security number? It\u2019s a 9-digit number you are assigned from either birth in the U.S. or when you move to the U.S. to become a citizen or permanent resident. Social Security is a program in the U.S. designed to provide the elderly with an income once they reach a certain age (currently 66 but changes depending on a few different factors). The income the elderly receive depends upon what they made in income over the course of their lives. It\u2019s more complicated than that, but you get the picture. When Americans file their federal income taxes every year, this is when they report to the government how much they made in income. In addition to that, over the course of the year, they have contributed to social security (through taxes). When they file the taxes, it is all filed by your social security number. Financial Institutions use social security numbers as a way of identifying individuals in the U.S. It is the only identification that every single (legal) American has. Not every American has a passport or driver\u2019s license or state ID. When I say Financial Institutions, I also mean Creditors. Your social security number is linked to your credit and credit score. What\u2019s a credit score? At the most basic level, this score tells Financial Institutions if you pay your bills and manage money well. Your credit score will be evaluated when you rent an apartment, apply for a mortgage, apply for a credit card, take out a car loan, etc. The biggest concern with this is identity theft. Someone could pretend to be you if they obtained your social security number. Now, a Financial Institution may ask for more than just your Social Security Number. But how hard is it now-a-days to get someone\u2019s birthday, address, phone number, mother\u2019s maiden name? Have access to Facebook? You now have all that information. If a Credit Card application comes in the mail, it\u2019s easy to sign up for a credit card with someone else\u2019s social security number. So, what happens if your identity IS stolen? If you like headaches, you\u2019ll like getting your identity stolen. Ideally, once you got a notice that a credit card in your name is due for $10,000, you would call the company, tell them your identity was stolen, and they\u2019d shut it down and fix your credit. In reality? Sure, they may cancel the card at your request, but they may ask for proof that your identity was stolen and you didn\u2019t really spend $10,000. How do you prove you didn\u2019t spend $10,000? And even if all of that was cleared up (ya know, in 5 years), they probably wouldn\u2019t bother fixing your credit score."}]}
{"id": "5jf3u5", "input": "Why do corporations who cause deaths only get fined, but people get imprisoned?", "output": [{"answer": "I'm studying criminology at the moment. A substantial part of the course that I'm studying is on the relationship between *power* and the definition of crime. It's argued that those with power can influence the definition of crime in order to preserve their own interests. For (hypothetical) example, in the war on drugs, the government may decide to be particularly punitive to dealers who sell dangerous drugs to university students. As most of these dealers don't have much of a voice (what with being outlaws) this law will be unopposed. If the same government decides to extend the mandatory length of testing for a new antidepresent, following reports of student suicides, there's likely to be a lot of money thrown at the campaign and lobby groups to get them to reconsider. So we consider one drug related death as a clear crime, whereas the other is never really criminalised, so can't be punished. Edit: or at least that's what I've gathered so far. I'm only about three months in to a year long course."}]}

None of the top comments at (this time) mention that the ball (in most ball-point pens) is spring loaded, and when depressed/touching allows the ink to flow around the ball and onto whatever it is touching. I can speculate; W/ the cap on, noting can press on the ball, and the spring is able to then close the ink off from the air. - w/ the cap off, the ball can be is depressed slightly b the seight of the pen, (or contact with the container) allowing air to dry the ink out. Since the ink (in most ball point pens) is gravity fed, storing the pens point up is not ideal, and frequently the pint will come to rest at the bottom of whatever cup or basket pens are stored in. Surface tension drawing the solvent from ink out and into/onto the pen's container may also have some effect. The hole is to make removing the cap easier."}]}

And all that hassle because some people can't figure out that USB plugs have a logo on it that clearly always goes on top or front of the plug."}]}
