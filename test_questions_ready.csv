"question: What's the deal with these CEOs raising prices on generic drugs? If they're generic, can't another manufacturer produce them for much cheaper?It seems like the only thing that will happen is that the company will get really bad publicity... ","answer: In the case of Daraprim (this is the one that is in the news currently), even though the patents have long expired, the distribution is still tightly controlled, meaning it's not easy for generic drug manufacturers to get ahold of it. They'll need to compare their version to the real deal in order to get FDA approval, and it's not easy to do when the distribution of the drug is tightly controlled.","answer: It should be noted most of the expensive drugs are USA exclusive.  You can get most drugs cheaper online.\n\nMy drug for example is $35 for 30 day supply, if I got name brand in the usa it would be $2,400 fr same amount.  That is how fucked up the system is.\n\nIn fact I buy all my perscription drugs online now, online pharmacy offer %100 resend of meds if customs takes it.  So really no reason to spend that much for mst drug s.",3
"question: Do dogs ever get lonely if they are exclusively in the company of humans, but never around other dogs? ","answer: Have two dogs. They fight for attention just like children would.\n\nThey get lonely if they aren't getting attention if they're on their own (locked away from a room containing humans) or if they're in a room with humans and another dog, both will fight each other for attention.\n\nThis observation is based on the two long standing dog family members both female, (An intelligent Collie and a Lhasa Apso) and their behaviour around the rest of the human family.\n\nThey appear to require humans more than other dogs.","answer: My friend had 2 dogs.  \nThey were inseparable, they played together every day.   \nOne day, one dog died.  \nMy friend worried the other dog would get seriously depressed.  \nThe remaining dog didn't seem to give a shit.",4
"question: Why aren’t there any diseases which benefit the human body?I know that some diseases can make a person feel physically (and mentally) weak. Why is the opposite of this not true? Surely a disease that would benefit the human body wouldn’t be cured on purpose? (Heightened senses, increased strength, etc.) ","answer: [Hookworms reduce the symptoms of allergies](_URL_1_).\n\nBut for the most part, diseases/infections are selfishly trying to re-produce inside you or they don't want to be in *humans*.","answer: That's like asking why aren't there any car crashes that make the car run faster afterward.\n\nThe human body is an incredibly complicated, delicately balanced biological machine.  There are millions of ways to through it out of balance, but only a few ways to improve it.  Any random change is likely to be a change for the worse.",5
"question: Why is it so taboo to ask about someone's salary?EDIT: Thank you for all your wonderful responses! I'd love to hear if it's taboo in your country (not the US). This is obviously a cultural phenomenon and I wonder if there is an anthropological explanation to this?\n\nEDIT 2: Ok ok, I get it, it's none of my *god damn business*. But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? ","answer: It's just a personal question. I mean, why is it taboo to ask a random person the size of their penis or how often they masturbate?",answer: I work in sales in commission in the UK. I'm so glad we talk about money all the time. Makes life so much easier.,3
"question: Why didn't the federal government give bailout money to home owners instead of the banks?Why didn't the federal government give bailout money directly to homeowners in pre foreclosure, with stipulation that money must be used towards their mortgage?  Wouldn't this have ultimately achieved the same result (bank getting the bailout money) without so many people being foreclosed on?  ","answer: The government acted as investor for 9 Trillion of the 12.1 Trillion involved in the bailout. Many of these investments have turned out to be money-makers for the government, lowering the overall amount of spending with the bailout. With households, there was no clear opportunity for the government to get their investment back. We would have each* gotten an unsecured, $40K loan. \n\nI agree that the bailout was the wrong move, not because of the way the bailout has performed (better than expected), but because of the precedence this set. Right now, our savvy business folks are knuckle-deep in shadow banking in China and another housing bubble in the US, predicated on private equity purchasing rental properties. How do I know that? Because these are both high-risk, high-return activities. Seeking the highest returns is a requirement of any public company (thanks for all the fees and dangerous incentives 401(k)!), so they *have* to get involved with stupid shit like this. Plus, we not only *told* them that we'd bail them out, we *proved it*. Bonuses for good performance, bailouts for bad performance. Oh, what the hell; keep that bonus. Uncle Sugar ain't mad.\n\n*assuming every one of US's 300 million citizens were eligible and received an equal portion of the 12.1 trillion.",answer: Get ready for a lot of angry people who know very little about economics,1.5
"question: Why are people allowed to request their face be blurred out/censored in photos and videos, but celebrities are harassed daily by paparazzi putting their pics and videos in magazines, on the Internet and on TV? ","answer: In Germany, you are allowed to take and publish pictures of big groups of people as long as no one stands out dominantly, like, for example, on a public square. \nBut if you take a picture or video of one person, or a few, you have to ask them for permission to publish it. If they don't you can still publish it, but have to make them unrecognizable. \n\nPersons of public interest are exempt, but their kids or family are not. \nOnly if you are the one that's actively looking to be in the limelight (mostly through your job), you have to live with your picture being published without you being asked. That's why stars and politicians are in the news all the time. \n\nI believe there might be something about when they could have expected to be in privacy, though. Like sunbathing topless on a remote property but being photographed via mega-zoom-lens by a paparazzi. They might try and get these removed. But I'm not 100% sure there.","answer: If you want to be a public figure, then you give up some rights to privacy when in public.",5
"question: People who are exposed to the cold more build a tolerance. Is this a physically built resistant, or is it all mental?Like does your skin actually change to become resistant to cold temperatures, or is it just all in your head?\n\nEdit: Yes! Finally got something to the front page. I got the idea for this topic because I just watched Revenant yesterday, and was thinking about it as I went for a morning stroll through my not-nearly-as-cold neighborhood.  ","answer: I'm literally allergic to the cold, so acclimatization isn't going to work for me. It's called cold urticaria, which essentially means when my skin remains in contact with something cold for too long, I get an allergic reaction which usually includes inflammation and hives.\n\nI could potentially die if I run into water cold enough that I asphyxiate withe the reaction around my face/neck or my blood pressure drops dangerously low. Interesting, huh?",answer: You definitely adapt to the temperatures. When I was in the Middle East in 2003 during my service it was about 120-140 every day during the summer. After a few weeks of suffering and drinking a few gallons of water a day it got much easier to cope with the temps and my water consumption went way down and I was still just as hydrated. When it got to November and the temps got down into the 90s we all wore sweaters and jackets because it felt so cold.  So I'd say your body adapts as well as your mind.,5
question: Why is there a blood shortage? Hospitals charge like $800 per unit. Why don't they pay $250 for a donation. Everyone would donate. ELI5 ,"answer: I'm a little late to the party, but oh well:\n\nLike previously said, you don't want to encourage people to donate when they shouldn't. As in:\n\n* they're sick, running a fever, etc.\n* they just donated a week ago, not giving their body enough time to regenerate the lost red blood cells\n* they are unsure of their status, as in hepatitis, HIV, etc, or have exposed themselves to this since their last donation and might omit this information\n* for women, they might be pregnant in the time between the last donation and this one\n\nAs for the hospital/blood center customer itself:\n\n**Yes, they may charge $800/unit to the patient, but this is NOT the cost that the hospital pays to the blood center.** The markup is due to the pre-transfusion testing that the hospital performs. It's not just ordered by the hospital and passed directly to the patient - further testing is performed to ensure compatibility to the recipient. It's a huge liability to give blood to a patient without prior testing and is heavily discouraged unless it's an emergency situation. My hospital paid around $225 for a regular unit without special requests (CMV status, irradiated, etc). That $225 pays for the person before collection to screen patients, the person to collect the blood, the time to collect the blood, the products used to collect the blood, and the post-collection testing (HIV, hepatitis, etc). Also... a lot of blood just doesn't get used before it expires. It's just the nature of the beast. We do our best to limit this, but a large hospital will still expire 2-3 units on a 'good' day. The hospital ends up eating a lot of the extra cost.\n\nSource: I worked in a level-one trauma center blood bank for five years. I've seen it all.","answer: I'm not American, but that price seems high. [This](_URL_9_) seems to indicate significantly cheaper costs to patients.\nIf you look at the cost breakdown for a unit of blood product, banking, testing, separating, and acquiring blood is not cheap and makes up a significant portion of the cost. \nAlso remember that just because ""everyone"" would want to donate doesn't imply those people would be of the needed type, disease free, and able to donate safely.",4
question: Why does sleeping for 8 hours feel like only 5 minutes? ,"answer: Your consciousness, the system of bodily functions you call ""you"", completely shuts down. Just like when you die. This ""you"" does not exist while you're asleep, that's why you can't notice the missing time. When the body wakes up, a new ""you"" gets started. As all instances of this ""you"" have access to the same sensory organs and the same memory, an illusion of continuity and unity from day to day is created.",answer: If you want to have some crazy dreams that you will remember and make your sleep feel longer try eating some stuff with B12 vitamins in it. The easiest way I've found is to eat some cheese or bananas before going to bed.,2
"question: Why does Google want me to use my real name on YouTube? What advantage does google gain from this?Clearly they already have my name from my Gmail and (now mandatory) Google+ account. Why should Google care if I want to go by xXsasuke420noscopeXx, they already have that information.\n\nEdit: Stop commenting. My inbox is full.\n\nGo home guys.\n\nSeriously\n\nstop\n\n^please\n\n^^i'm ^^done\n\n^^^no ^^^more ^^^replies ","answer: I'm getting sick of continually being prompted to use my real name, not only for this but other sites.  I found out Amazon posted my real name for comments on their site, pissed me off that they made a change and didn't notify me.","answer: In addition to integrating social media with YouTube, they're trying to detoxify the environment around YouTube comments by making you attach your name to them instead of remaining anonymous.\n\nI'm less likely to troll someone for their race, skin color, or native language with my name attached to the comment.",5
"question: A long time ago, a person was able to work 40 hours a week and support a family. Today two people need to work 40 hours a week to barely support themselves living together. What changed?[removed] ",answer: Two points some people are ignoring.\nExecutive salaries increased by about the same as middleclass lost (by stagnation)\nMost jobs lost through automation are middle-management not enrylevel or unskilled.,answer: Capital has suceesfully destroyed the labor movement. Simple as that's. Through propaganda they have convinced the people to vote out of their self interest and have undone the progress made in the 1880's through the 1950's,5
"question: What exactly is wrong with standardized testing in schools?Not that I am a proponent of just endlessly testing students, but it appears to me that, on average, those with the highest test scores are still the ones who are the most intelligent, creative, and dedicated. Top schools take these students, and let me them succeed to their full potential.\n\nObviously there are a few who score low but are still extremely intelligent, but they aren't nearly as common.\n\nWhy do people want to change the system so badly, and to what? ","answer: As a teacher:\n\n - It's hard to get a rounded view of someone's ability through a test. I've known a lot of students through the years that could get a high mark, yet tell you nothing about the subject a week later. ""Cramming"" doesn't embed the knowledge like using it or arguing about it does.\n\n - All subjects are somewhat subjective. Having an exam board means I have to teach the way they expect. For example I teach IT and I've seen what I'd call image maps called all kinds of things (hot spot, picture link, etc. and yes they all meant the same thing), similarly site maps and other technical terms. \n\n - Because the syllabus for the exam needs to be small enough to be taught, but broad enough to get a sense of the subject you are stuck learning about whatever the guy who make the test thought was important. That limits a teacher's ability to make the subject more interesting by for example going off on a tangent or looking at topics that your students in particular find relevant. And ultimately, if you don't care about something you won't learn it effectively. In some cases you can make something interesting, but it's harder if you don't agree with its importance.\n\n - It encourages teaching exam technique more than anything. I've just run a mock exam and most of the dropped marks are students either not understanding what's being asked or not being able to put their thoughts onto paper. When in real life can you not ask clarifying questions? This again rewards those who can remember the correct words and those with good literacy skills.\n\n - Exams are a completely unrealistic environment. When on earth will you be stuck on your own, with no Internet or phone and not allowed to ask anyone? These days most jobs are about finding and selecting information and being collaborative and creative. Exams focus students on remembering the ""right"" answer rather than thinking about the topic. A wrong thought is often more useful than a right fact if you see what I mean.\n\n - As already touched upon they reward ""middle class"" skills like memory, sitting quietly, neat writing, good literacy. While these are important, they are not the be all and end all to being a useful human being.\n\nHowever you will never get rid of them in the current political system because each party needs to have a number they can see go up and down according to the tale they want to tell. Also, as seen here in the UK with English GCSEs recently, the state can intervene to alter results to make them look worse.\n\nA basic level is needed in literacy and numeracy (and possible IT) that could be tested with a standardised reading/writing/maths test. Beyond that really you need a system like universities where teachers are well trained and trusted to grade professionally. Backed up by a strong inspection and support system to ensure standards.","answer: All the reasons presented here are spot on. I'd like to add another consideration that hasn't been mentioned.\n\nI grew up and a very diverse city, my high school had about or maybe just over 3,000 students from every nationality you would think of; there were over 40 native languages in my school. However, ALL of the standardized testing was done in English. There was no option for Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, nothing. Only English. So, as you can imagine, non-native English speakers often times failed due to just a simple language barrier. This always infuriated me, my high school was technically a ""failing"" school, but how can accurately assess someone's knowledge if you're not willing to do so in their native tongue? I just don't get.\n\nSo you have that issue on top of all the other issues mentioned in this thread.",3
"question: Do people reviewing alcoholic beverages really taste all the wacky things they claim to?Don't get me wrong, I love a good glass of wine or scotch, but I've been browsing r/scotch and reading the reviews confuses the hell out of me. I've never had a glass of scotch and tasted ""buttery banana"", ""Canned pears"", ""marmalade sweetness"", ""Robusta coffee with condensed milk"", ""fertile soil and rotting leaves"", ""Rock salt and minerals"", or ""Chili flakes and smoked paprika"".\n\nAll of the descriptions above were not compiled from a series of posts, but rather came from a single review of one type of scotch by one person.\n\nDo people who give reviews in this way *actually* taste all of these things when they take a drink? Do they just have far more developed palates than I do, and are thus able to distinguish these flavors, or are they just making it up to sound like they know what they're doing? ","answer: There is a good documentary about this called sommelier.  In it, five guys try out to become master sommeliers, or wine servers.\n\nPart of the test is to taste six wines and say where they are from down to the vineyard.  You do this by describing the taste.  They could be from anywhere, any continent, and you have nothing to go on but your senses.\n\nThey taste a lot of crazy stuff in there, but they could tell what wine it was.  So thats as close to proof that ive seen that at least for some people it is not bullshit.","answer: Yes, and you're tasting these things too, without the necessary means to describe them. In the same way as a child a German Shepherd and a Rottweiler were both just ""dog"", your palate just needs a better vocabulary. Consider that the taste of a drink can change wildly between multiple variables (age, temperature, etc;) and you're absolutely going to find more subtle notes the longer you spend critiquing it.\n\nThere's a pretty interesting (albeit pretentious) documentary on Netflix called ""Somm"" that takes a look into the world of sommeliers (wine stewards) I'd recommend if you wanted to see just how refined your palate can become.",4
"question: Decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house.\n\nWhat's changed in the past decades?\n\n & nbsp;\n\n & nbsp;\n\nEDIT: This is depressing. ","answer: In 1975 the price of gas was 74.9 cents per gallon (in the USA), a loaf of bread was 50 cents and you could get day old bread as low as 10 cents per loaf. Breakfast cereal was only $1.00. A new car was less than $5000 and a 4 bedroom 3 1/2 bath home could be had in most suburbs for as little as $50,000 with even lower prices in many small towns throughout the country. There wasn't cable or satellite and nothing like a cell phone was even thought of yet. Also kids moved out at 18 and didn't hang around until they were 30.\n\nAdd to that women entering the workforce giving families two incomes allowing them to afford better cars and bigger homes, not to mention better food.\n\nNow a loaf of bread is $2.50 or even $3.00, gas is still over $3.00 per gallon and a 4 bedroom home costs you over $1 million. More and more major road systems and bridges require a toll to use (in addition to any taxes you pay).\n\nAdding all that up, a family needs 3 or 4 incomes just to live.","answer: And they had more kids, too! Most people today have only one, and two at most.",1.5

question: how do most flamboyant gay guys sound so different then straight guys? Do they train themselves to sound like that? ,answer: The same reason guys/girls try to act cool/dress differently/flex/wear makeup: to impress or attract mates.,"answer: It's probably cultural, just like how the black community has it's own accent and cadences(which white people who grow up in black communities also have just like black people who grew up in white communities don't have it), the gay community adopted its own in an attempt to form a cultural identity. The preconception is that homosexual males tend to be more effeminate than their straight counterparts (whether or not this is actually true) so it just kind of became expected. What I want to know is what came first, the stereotype or the cadence?",5
"question: Why does everyone follow protocol when addressing people of seniority/rank? What's actually stopping me from walking up to the US president and saying ""Hi, Barack""? What would happen if I did?Thanks for the responses.\n\nI guess my original thought was pretty much right: it's simply a show of respect...and nothing much would happen if you didn't use their correct title. I can't wait to bump into Barack now.\n\nEDIT: and in case anyone misunderstood my question, I definitely didn't mean addressing anybody in a (purposely) disrespectful way. I was thinking more along the lines of a friendly but casual hello. ",answer: Nothing would happen. I wish more US civilians would understand this:\n\nThe government works for you! You are their boss. You out-rank them.\n\nI know it may not seem like it a lot of the time but that's how it works. The US military in specific is HIGHLY sensitive to public opinion. You can walk up to a four-star general and tell him he sucks at his job.,"answer: Nothing would happen if you called the US President by his first name in the US.\n\nHowever, the same can't be said for many other countries. It depends on the country and its laws.",5
"question: How does New Horizons avoid space debris for 9 years and three billion miles?Considering a tiny rock could devastate the spacecraft, is there a way NASA can mitigate the risk of impact or is it just a cross your fingers situation?  ","answer: Don't think of space as Han Solo flying through an asteroid field. Hell, even asteroid fields aren't like that.\n\nSpace is incredibly empty. Pretty much the only way that you're going to hit something in space is if you're *trying* to hit it.","answer: Our solar system is basically made of a bunch of really old vacuum cleaners. I mean REALLY old. And we call them planets and moons.\n\nOver about 5,000,000,000 years, they've been flying around in circles sucking up everything they could find.\n\nThey're really really good at getting rid of stuff floating around out there.\n\nImagine if your grandma and about 250 of her friends had been vacuuming the living room floor constantly for 5 billion years.\n\nIt'd be pretty clean.\n\nIf you go skipping across that floor, the odds of you getting even a spec of dust on your feet is as crazy low as anything you can imagine.

The trailer alone will answer your question.\n\n[**LINK:** Do I Sound Gay?](_URL_2_)",4
question: Why do I feel like I'm going to vomit when I get really hungry? ,answer: Cause your stomach is trying to digest your stomach.,"answer: Your respirations, or breaths in and out, become more shallow and rapid (ex. Hyperventilating). This causes your oxygen (good air) levels to drop, and your carbon dioxide (bad air) levels in the blood to rise. Blood sugar at this time is obsolete (irrelevant). Next time you feel angry, try to focus on slowing down your breaths. You will not get nauseous. \n\nEdit: Holy shit I read this wrong. Hungry not angry. I wondered why everyone was getting so off topic. Agree with first comment. Your blood sugars are not consistent. If you keep glucose levels...uh, level throughout the day you should never have that feeling. In other words, eat small meals every 2-3 hrs, even if you are fat. And don't freaking starve yourself. It's lame.",5
question: Why do zoos prepare animal food as if the animals were at restaurants? why not give the whole uncut vegetable instead of cutting it into pieces? ,"answer: Some reasons,\n\n- Enables all individuals in a group to obtain enough of each food type and reduces aggression.\n\n- Prevents wastage caused by animals taking one bite and discarding the rest of a large item.\n\n- Makes it so that you can scatter the food over a larger area to encourage foraging behaviour.\n\nThere has been some research about if it's a good thing or not since there are some downsides too.","answer: It also ensures that the animal is getting all of the nutrients they need. And, in animals that don't forage, the food is usually placed in a few specific places in the enclosure or on specific platforms that the animals are conditioned to know are used for feeding. That way, the least amount of food goes to waste as possible.\n\nHere's an example: I worked as a camp counselor for two summers at a small zoo near me. Because one of the camp themes was focused on what you need to do to take care of the animals (essentially turning the kids into mini zookeepers for two weeks) and we had to walk through everything we would be doing with the kids, we got to prepare food for and feed the animals.\n\nNow, one of the animals was a polar bear. Instead of throwing chunks of fish and whatever else into it's enclosure where the polar bear may not find them/where they'd rot, we would have to make special meatballs and roll them under a special door in the enclosure where the polar bear was waiting to catch them. These meatballs not only had fish, but also had vitamin and mineral powder mixed in as well as some kelp and a fair amount of fat and meat from some other meat source (I want to say venison or something like that) to ensure that she got as realistic a diet as possible living in captivity.",4
"question: Why does American culture put so much emphasis on ""moving out of the house"" and being independent from one's family, when other cultures (e.g. Asian and Spanish) live with their extended family under the same roof throughout their lifetimes?[removed] ","answer: Idk why but then they all complain about not having money and not being able to afford rent, bills, college debt, etc. You save thousands of dollars a month by not moving out. More people should try it (that is not moving out immediately after high school/college, not living with your parents til your 30)","answer: As an American I know what you are saying. I am a country manager of oil and gas companies in the middle east. My guys buy houses to move their parents in with them. I honestly ask them WTF but that is they way they think.

"question: why people in third world countries starve when people used to be able to live off the land?I am not trying to judge them in any way, just something I think about sometimes.  We hear all the time about people in Africa etc. dying of thirst and hunger.  People have lived there for a long time, and somehow survived off the land.  What changed? ","answer: OP, the use of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd worlds is out dated. The terms are now developed and developing countries. The 3 worlds theory was used to separate communists, the west, and other countries not involved in the cold war. Since the USSR no longer exists, the theory has no real value today.\n\n\nAs for your questions, I'll try my best to keep it ELI5.\n\nThe people who you see starving represent a small, small part of the developing world. Those people are starving because their governments are allowing them to. Their governments can't invest in sectors that would help the nation grow. In this case, it's agriculture. Agriculture is always the first step a country takes to becoming wealthy. It goes agriculture  >  trade  >  manufacturing. \n\n\nSo you see, the people dying aren't dying because they can't farm. They're dying because they live in an area that *can't* grow food and their government won't help them find jobs in areas that *can* so they can feed themselves.","answer: I always picture trying to explain the wide gaps humans have in technology levels to aliens. \n\n* Alien: ""Okay so these humans on this part of the planet live in climate controlled homes and drive SUV's, over here on this patch of land we have humans who live in huts and have trouble surviving their first year of life...""\n\n* Me: ""Uh well you see... it's uh... yeah... wanna play some Call of Duty?!""",1.5
question: Why is there a blood shortage? Hospitals charge like $800 per unit. Why don't they pay $250 for a donation. Everyone would donate. ELI5 ,"answer: This is a modern debate in the law: do you own your own body?  If so, can you sell your kidney?  If not, why not?  \n\nIf yes, can you sell yourself into slavery? (say, have the money go to your mother who needs an expensive treatment).  \n\nIf not, do you own the produce of your labor? If yes, what is the difference?  \n\nI could write hundreds of pages on the above questions alone.  It is relevant to your question because we presently cannot pay people to donate parts of their bodies.  \n\n----\n\nThe other part of your question is, why is there a shortage?  \n\nThe shortage isn't in the supply, it is in the distribution, storage, and allocation.  It costs a great deal of money to move, store, and efficiently allocate these products.",answer: This is how you get blood bandits. Do you *really* want blood bandits?,1
question: Why don't animals attempt suicide? ,"answer: I was reading about a kangaroo whose joey fell off a cliff and died. She paced back and forth for a long time, very distraught, and eventually jumped. Hard to say if it was a suicide or she wanted after her baby.","answer: A lot of animals are well known to commit suicide. A lot of new parrot owners may find themselves being instructed not to leave their bird alone. If you end up in a situation where your parrot is alone a lot, it could start self harming or commit suicide from loneliness. It may be recommended to purchase two birds for some species.",5
"question: Even though America has spent 10 years and over $100 billion to recruit, train and arm the Iraqi military, they still seem as inept as ever and run away from fights.

Almost* all Arab military units suck, because of lack of trust and cohesion. 1st and 2nd Cousin marriage and tightly-knit families are very common in the mid East. \n\n > In Iraq, as in much of the region, nearly half of all married couples are first or second cousins to each other. A 1986 study of 4,500 married hospital patients and staff in Baghdad found that 46% were wed to a first or second cousin, while a smaller 1989 survey found 53% were ""consanguineously"" married. The most prominent example of an Iraqi first cousin marriage is that of Saddam Hussein and his first wife Sajida. \n\n[One US officer puts it like this...](_URL_3_)\n\n > The Arabs are what the sociologists like to call “amoral familists.” This means that they are nearly or totally incapable of forming bonds of love and loyalty with anyone not a blood relation. Even then, the degree of blood relation determines where loyalty legitimately lies. The saying in the area is: “Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother and my cousin against the world.” This not only allows a superior to extort baksheesh from non-relations, but identifies him as an idiot – a weak idiot, actually – if he does not.\n\n > The Arab private? He’s no more a coward than anybody else. Indeed, as an individual, I might rate him above, or even substantially above, the human norm. But he is just one man, alone.\n\n > With us, the very broad us within the western military tradition and some eastern military traditions, or with Israelis, who are very western, “It’s all of us against all of them. They’re toast.” With him? With that poor dumb-shit Arab private? “It’s all of them against me alone. I’m toast.”","answer: Nation building is a waste of time and resources and is a failed  doctrine. When the people of Iraq collectively want peace, prosperity, security they will create it for themselves. This cannot be for forced on a society they must want it.

"question: People who are exposed to the cold more build a tolerance. Is this a physically built resistant, or is it all mental?Like does your skin actually change to become resistant to cold temperatures, or is it just all in your head?\n\nEdit: Yes! Finally got something to the front page. I got the idea for this topic because I just watched Revenant yesterday, and was thinking about it as I went for a morning stroll through my not-nearly-as-cold neighborhood.  ","answer: There's a lot of great info here by some people and others not so much. There's a synergistic effect of all these systems working together, and you can mentally steel yourself to the cold, but no one has seemed to mention the largest contributing factor; cholesterol.\n\nCholesterol is a very important molecule in physiology. Within this context its role is within cell walls. Cholesterol fits in-between fatty acids within the phospholipid bilayer. It's concentration effects cell rigidity or flexibility.\n\nGreater amounts of cholesterol will be sent to the cells to protect them from cold shock and increase an organisms tolerance to exposure. This cholesterol comes from diet or adipocytes and profound effects roll out from here. While the composition of lipids within the bilayer will change to less unsaturated fats and more saturated so that they stack better, cholesterol is the key to this whole ordeal. \n\nThere is a lot more going on from a biochemical standpoint but that's the main factor. Not very ELI5 but it's how it works.",answer: Both. As a 8th grader I spent the whole (european) winter in a t-shirt and simply told myself to ignore the cold and try to not shake.\n\nSimiliar like I tell myself that I don't care about anything to not be nervous when going into a presentation.\n\nAccording to *Psychology Today* there are many benefits in self manipulation via talking to yourself.,3
"question: If bullpen pitchers are so good (compared to starters, it seems), why do they see relatively little playing time?I think it makes more sense that you would play your best pitchers more than your less-skilled ones, but I'm not too knowledgeable about baseball. ","answer: Starting and relieving (and closing) are different kinds of tasks.  Starters play for a long time and have to face the same batters several times.  As hitters get used to the pitcher (and watch their teammates at bat), they'll start hitting better.  Combined with the pitcher getting tired, at some point they won't be effective any more.\n\nThen relievers come in and usually don't pitch long enough to see the same batter twice, and also know they won't be in the game for long so they can go all-out all the time instead of having to pace themselves.  These factors combined can make it look like a reliever is way better than the starters, but these relievers would mostly not be too good if put in the same kind of situation as a starter.\n\nThe extreme example is the closer, who just comes in when the team has the lead to get the last 3 outs.  Nobody's used to trying to hit him, and he can just burn fastballs because he only has to throw a few.  For as dominant as Mariano Rivera was, if you tried to have him pitch 3 innings he wouldn't have done well.",answer: You also have to remember that the last 6 outs are extremely hard outs to get. Especially in a World Series game. That is why bullpen importance is trending higher than it ever has in the history of the game. Your starting to see some of your better pitchers come out of the bullpen nowadays and the really great ones sometimes will make the transition to a starter. The numbers for bullpen pitchers are skewed bc one inning of severe damage could jack your E.R.A. up. But you don't make it to the World Series or the postseason for that matter without a great bullpen.,5
"question: Why does a major chord sound happy, while a minor chord sounds sad?Same as many other chords having some emotion attached to it.\n\nIs it PURELY because of how we are used to it in society or is there a biological reason for it? ","answer: Well, hmm.  I am a musician who has spent a lot of time building a personal relationship with harmony.  I think social/cultural conditioning is definitely the first explanation for this.  However, there are many examples of different, unconnected cultures sharing similarities in their folk/traditional music.  This is usually related to the pentatonic scale, that being 5 notes which, in general, don't produce any harsh intervals (spaces between notes, when a chord is played it is defined by the space separating each note). If you are near a piano and don't have any playing experience, try messing around with just the black keys, as they make up a pentatonic scale. \n\nAs explained by other commenters, the relation to the harmonic series, or natural occurrence of overtones in resonant spaces in our world, is important.  The natural series doesn't first make just a pentatonic scale, it is a little bit more, but the pentatonic scale is in there.\n\n[Here](_URL_7_) is a cool video playing the harmonic series to a certain point.  This exists everywhere, and I mean everywhere.  Brass instruments, wind instruments, string instruments (harmonics on a guitar), any tubes, any resonant spaces, a cave even, all have a resonance that follow these steps.\n\nSo, I believe that this natural series is just familiar with everyone, because it is prevalent through everything in our world.  There is always a sense of arriving at ""home"" (the fundamental note, the lowest note, the first note in the scale), or moving away from ""home"".  From that one note, there is a this natural ORDER, all notes can be found in the harmonic series, but the ones that come first are the most ""pleasing"" or ""comfortable"" sounding.\n\nMusicians over the course of thousands of years have built systems to both embrace and take artistic liberty with the sounds found in the world.  Western music has made a system of 12 tones, others include smaller divisions of notes as well, such as South Indian classical music.  We have gone through many changes in what is comfortable to our ears, and what is allowed by the current musical standards.  Bach wrote some of the most beautiful music ever IMHO, but in his time, even the saddest of songs would end on a major chord because, well, thats just how it was.  You didn't end a song on a minor chord, ever.  Please take the time to listen to [this beautiful prelude](_URL_8_) until the very last chord and think about how different that makes you feel than what we would expect (to end on the root minor, ""sad"" chord).\n\nNowadays, we have been accustomed to so many different composers' ways of expressing emotions through harmony in things like movie scores that there definitely is a shared familiarity with tonality/atonality in the general public.  There are undeniable aspects of tension and release that everyone shares, and I believe that this is attributed to the basic relation to the harmonic series in nature.\n\nI'm sure you are all more than familiar enough with tonal music, turn on your radio, these days things are getting more and MORE tonal in popular music, and seemingly have been since the 50s/60s when showtunes and similar music that had been using interesting harmonies became less popular.  Anyways, here are some examples of movie music you may be familiar with and I defy you to tell me they are not pulling some strings within you and providing much tension and release (more tension)\n\n\n[Movie music from psycho](_URL_9_)\n\n[Music from there will be blood](_URL_6_)\n\n\nDamn, it's early, and that was long winded and most likely unclear.

"question: Lottery earnings, how does the IRS/government look and treat them?[removed] ","answer: All winning are treated as income. Winning a jackpot just puts in you in the top tax bracket for that year which means you are going to pay about 50% of it in taxes. This is for the USA only, most other countries don't treat winning as income so you keep what you win everywhere else. \n\nThe food stamp program is it's own program and has it's own rules about who is eligible. While they would consider your winnings as income, they probably don't see it as regular income. You made zero last year, you are going to make zero next year, this year is just a blip where you made money but because of expected earning next year, it doesn't disqualify you from benefits this year. \n\nMost likely rules to encourage people to move up and earn more without fear of being worse off for making a little more money or winning a prize and loosing more in benefits than what they earned.\n\nThe rules probably never considered a mega jackpot winner, let alone one that would continue to apply for benefits even though they are now a millionaire.","answer: lotto winnings are gambling winnings, taxed as ordinary income,  but the food stamp system seems to have some holes that do not consider net worth, just income.

"question: How can Roman bridges be still standing after 2000 years, but my 10 year old concrete driveway is cracking? ","answer: Your driveway is a cheap imitation called portland cement, mainly ground limestone and other rocks. The formula for Roman concrete was lost until just recently, and added volcanic ash and seawater. Salt would actually corrode cement, but the ash resists it somehow, and maybe it gives it some equilibrium against the environment (utter speculation).\n\nVolcanic ash might not be economical in the quantities we use today, and salt might damage steel reinforcement.\n\nYour driveway is also one big slab. Big slabs tend to crack from thermal expansion, or if water gets in and freezes. I doubt it freezes in Rome most years.","answer: This is true, however 2000 year old bridges obviously did not constantly have 2500 lb cars driving over them. They had people walking over them.

"question: why is it bad to transplant a houseplant into a pot that's too big for it, but the same plants can grow in the wild with unlimited soil?

question: what is red and blue shift?I don't understand what this stuff means. if someone could give me the simplest answer (I know it's a complicated topic) that'd be very helpful!  ,"answer: Ever notice the sound of a car or train is higher pitched when it's heading toward you, and becomes lower as it goes away? Light does the same thing. If you look at an object that's heading away from you quickly enough, it will appear more red than it actually is. If something is heading towards you, it will appear more blue.\n\nThis becomes very useful for astronomers; if you know a certain object's composition, you can tell how fast it's moving by the color change.","answer: Have you ever listened to a train coming torwards you blaring it's horn? Notice how the pitch gets high when it's approaching you? That happens when the sound waves from the horn get compressed in front of it because of the train moving. When the train passes, the pitch becomes lower for the same reason. Here is an illustration that describes what I'm saying. [Image](_URL_0_)\n\nBecause light sorta behaves like a wave just like sound, the same exact thing happens when things giving off light move. But instead of the pitch changing, we see the color change. If it's moving away, the light waves gets stretched, so it moves torwards the red side of the spectrum (redshift). When it's moving torwards us, the waves gets compressed and move torwards the blue side of the sepctrum (blue shift).",5

"question: What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm.[removed] ","answer: Depends on the drug. Some drugs, like epinephrine, are actually better absorbed through muscle tissue, which is why epi-pens are used on the thigh. Drugs which are injected into a vein, however, will likely cause tissue necrosis (death) or even worse things if improperly used.","answer: MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. \n\nHowever, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations.\n\nWhen it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to ""skin popping"", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial ""intradermal"" injection. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. All those nasty pictures you've seen floating around Reddit of ""krokodil"" users and their horrid necrotizing skin infections are the result of chronic skin popping and IM drug injection.",5

","answer: A fall in union participation rates is what has done it.  Many will argue otherwise but it is the reason we make the same amount of money as we did 40 years ago.  Real wages have been stuck at levels seen in the early 70s.  \n\nThe reason why we don't have so many unions anymore is complex.  Jobs have changed over the decades away from the more niche skilled labor jobs seen in the past that are union-type jobs and now are more diversified.  That is how labor has fallen behind.  We have been split up and separated so we cannot unionize.  Its also easier to replace non-skilled, think technically trained, labor, so if we unionize and strike at fast food establishments, they can find just about anyone to replace the striking workers.

There were so few people on the planet they didn't have to compete with people outside their country i.e. globalization didn't exist.

We are held to a high standard because we set ourselves up to a high standard.,"answer: Large scale farming and plantation was possible because of slave labor; without its valuable agricultural exports, America wouldn't have achieved economic sustainability. America's ability to be independent was thanks to slave labor, making slaves a vital part of the country's history.\n\nThe African slaves also created a unique community which adds to the broader American identity as a mixing pot, like any other immigrant population - though they were the only one brought here unwillingly, incidentally. \n\nLastly, owing to that agricultural foundation, the American practice of slavery continued past that of other superpowers and its cessation lead to global consequences.\n\nSlavery was a cruel practice with no room in civilized society, and it's important to study and preserve its roots in order to appreciate its continued effect - including the first-world's current dependence upon third-world slave labor.",4
"question: What is honey? I know honey comes from bees, and I know honey is delicious on toast, but what is honey, and does it harm the bees we harvest it from? Can you trace back a batch of honey to the hive it came from, or is all honey the same? ","answer: Many flowers secrete nectar as part of their biology. They lack the ability to move pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers so they entice bees and insects with nectar with the hope the while the bees collect the nectar they also move the pollen around allowing for the fertilization of the plant species.\n\nHoney bees have a special compartment in their body to hold nectar. This compartment (called the crop or honey stomach) is designed to allow the bee nectar storage while it is foraging. When the forager bee returns to the hive she passes the nectar to a receiver bee who puts it in a wax comb cell for ripening. Nectar has a high moisture content, perhaps 40+%, but the bees want to store the honey for future consumption. They regulate the humidity in the hive via wing flapping over fresh stored nectar and move air in and out from the entrances. Once the honey is at 17/18% moisture content it is ready for capping. The bees cap the cell with wax and that honey will stay in storage until they need it.\n\nIf the season goes well, the colony may collect for example, twice the amount of honey they will need for winter. The beekeeper can take that extra and this harvesting does not harm the bees at all.","answer: Note that honey isn't just evaporated nectar. Enzymes and digestive processes take effect while the nectar is in the bee's honey-stomach, changing the nature of the sugars.",1.5
"question: Why didn't the federal government give bailout money to home owners instead of the banks?Why didn't the federal government give bailout money directly to homeowners in pre foreclosure, with stipulation that money must be used towards their mortgage?

question: What is the difference between 'the cloud' and traditional web servers?Is the cloud just basically a server? I'm under the impression that the term 'the cloud' is just used as a marketing scheme/selling point to reel in uninformed customers and charge them a higher price. ,"answer: It's a marketing term but has little/nothing to do with charging a higher price.  Traditional servers only store the information they are going to need to display to others who make a request.  A web server would contain only web content for example.\n\nThe cloud is a server, or group of servers, who are doing something that traditionally would have been done by the local computer or network.  So for example, a data backup system that uses the internet to store the data would be a cloud based solution.  Wheres a more traditional approach would be to have a server in a closet some ware that does the nightly backup.\n\nSaying ""the cloud"" is just a catch all term that means the computers performing the work are off site, and accessible via the internet.  Often (but not always) is refers to work that is being subcontracted. \n\nSo, while it IS a marketing term it's not just to ""charge more money"" but rather to be clear with your customers how your product is different than the old way. \n\nAs with all marketing terms it suffers the problem of having no hard definition.  Therefore, over time, it loses value as a descriptive term, that's about where we are right now.","answer: The 'cloud' is a marketing term. Nothing more. (And not even a good one in my opinion. How the hell is it cloud like?)\n\nThere have been advances in what can be offered on remote systems, like Amazon's AWS that lets you make virtual machines, subnets, databases and all sorts of crap that scale and all that nice stuff, but essentially yeah, it's still just a remote system doing something at your behest.\n\nProbably the marketing teams behind it figured it'd be easier to just pretend it's some new computer magic rather than explain it's just a new service that lets you do new things over the network that traditionally you wouldn't or could not.",4

SO the conflict starts when the President of Ukraine (from the East) decides to stand in the way of the Europeanization of Ukraine (something about the EU, not sure if they were joining or just trying to take steps to join the EU, but they would be leaving some sort of economic pact with Russia for it). People in the west get pissed because they don't even like Russia, so they rise up and overthrow the Pro-Russian government, but there are still many Pro-Russians in Eastern Ukraine, and so Russia steps in to seize a warm water port that they always wanted, and also to protect the wishes of the Pro-Russian population in Eastern Russia.

question: Why is the accepted age of sexual relation/marriage so vastly different today than it was in the Middle Ages? Is it about life expectancy? What causes this societal shift? ,"answer: Marriage ages weren't universally low throughout previous time periods.  At least in Medieval England the average age of marriage was actually higher in Medieval England than it was throughout most of the 20th century in America. People get confused because, at least in regards to that period, the noble classes tended to marry young because of the potential political and financial benefits.  The lower classes still needed a solid profession before they could start a family.","answer: Because it's about love nowadays, not forwarding the bloodlines/reproduction as in the past.

question: what's up with all the weighing stations for trucks along interstate highways?

(really heavy trucks can't slow down, and can blow tires)\n\nIt's a really common problem for the companies shipping goods to want to overload the trucks, so these stations make sure they're not overloaded. \n\nThey can also check to make sure the driver has all the proper permits for the load they're carrying, check their log books to make sure they're operating and sleeping at appropriate intervals.

question: What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country? Why are they doing this?Putin says it is to protect the people living there (I did Google) but I can't seem to find any info to support that statement... Is there any truth to it? What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling ,"answer: The principal geopolitical reason is the freshwater port to the Black Sea, which will allow the Russian Navy to enter the Mediterranean Sea via the Bosporus at Istanbul. This will be Russia’s primary means to access the Atlantic Ocean without having to go through their Arctic and near-Arctic ports. \n\nHowever, Russia also is fearful of waning hegemony, or influence. That’s the heart of this whole thing, the tangible fear of a loss of influence. Much of the Ukraine is very interested in allying itself with the European Union; this was the foundation of the quasi-revolution in Kiev this past month, the decision of the former Prime Minister to ally with Moscow in deference to the EU. So, Russia sends their military into Crimea. This is a very forward, provocative move, but it has precedent in how Russia made moves on Georgia. After all, the other half still identifies itself with Russia. \n\nBoth Georgia and the Ukraine really are on the Eastern Frontier, separating the influence of Russia and Europe. But, since they are so isolated, it's that much easier for Russia to just bully them around without much Western influence other than “strong words”. \n\nRussia's other major fear is that these states will join NATO. This is popularly portrayed in Russia as a somewhat provocative force that counters their state's efforts to further a better life for its own nation. It also is likely that the West would welcome entrance into NATO for Ukraine should Russia not have intervened as it had. \n\nThe real takeaway is that Russia will further the maintenance of the status quo in the countries around its borders to prevent change, fostering stability. They want to keep their neighbors quiet and in line.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukraine's economy is garbage. They're deep in debt, have been witnessing the expatriation of capital throughout the last month, and interest rates are huge. The initial alignment between Russia and the Ukraine at the beginning of the year was essentially an economic bailout in exchange for alignment. Now, the EU and US are looking to offer monies to the new pro-Western Ukrainian government. \n\nFinally, this all comes down to Putin's government wanting to reengage the West in competition, to portray it as the counter to Russia. This positioning of influences to the Russian people furthers their allegiances to Putin, seeing him as championing their causes for life and prosperity. In essence, this is a bit of scapegoating. (Better, remember that Family Guy where Mayor West makes a big deal out of banning Gay Marriage after making a solid gold statue of cereal mogul Dig'Em of Dig'Em Smacks, then getting in trouble? Same thing, different players. The West is Gay Marriage while Putin's authoritarianistic power siege is Dig'Em. You dig it?)Plus, as the US has moved swiftly from two wars towards quasi-isolationist positioning in very rapid order, there are a lot of countries who’d be open to aligning themselves with a counter-US influence. That’s Russia more than it is China. \n\nThe big geopolitical variable, however, is revolutionary momentum spreading around. Reports are that the Balkans are now beginning to witness calls for change rising up on their allegiances  &  alignments. Imagine if this spreads to other centers along the Russian border, including the Latvian states, Azerbaijan, and even in some of the “Stans”. With only passive Western intervention, we could witness spreading demands for Western-style government and economics counter to the Russian offerings. \n\nGoing forward, the West is playing with a weak hand. The EU wants peace; Germany especially, as much of their power comes directly from Russia, and they don’t want their economy to suffer. But, they really want to expand their influence and welcome the Ukraine as a possible member to the EU. Meanwhile, the West appeased Russia before with the de facto appeasement of Georgia. The US’ only qualified engagement since then has been disinterested neglect until the media caught the story. Best the current administration can offer is (1) economic sanctions and (2) putting John Kerry in the country under the belief that Russia wouldn't dare risk the US' Secretary of State being killed in an armed invasion. But, after all these years of general geopolitical neglect, that’s about all the US can do. And because the US acted weak here, Putin figured he can act with impunity. After all, he’s done it before.","answer: You have to understand they're not invading Ukraine, rather they feel they're ""securing"" Crimea.",1.5

During the industrial revolution the inner-city city was more of a slum for the factory workers. These poor quality houses have only started to be improved within the last 30(?)years or so.

How can a court justify releasing a potentially harmful person for a large sum of cash? ,"answer: INNOCENCE UNTILL PROVEN GUILTY.\n\nI know it's hard for americans to grasp this concept, since you like to judge and sentence someone without any evidence, but at least in theory, presumption of innocence is a thing.","answer: It's not supposed to be a large sum of cash. It is supposed to be a refunded inconvenient amount of cash. Eg if a student is arrested for theft, set his bail at $500, so that he shows up for court. He really needs that $500, so he will show up to get it back. A rich person may have bail set at 10k since that would be an inconvenient amount to lose. So in come bail bondsmen, who now operate by default.  Bail bondsmen will pay your bail amount, for a 10% fee. So theoretically, you should now be paying less, though it will not be refunded. However, Courts assume you will use one, so now they set your bail at 10x the amount they would have. For a student on a petty crime, bail will be 5k. The student now has to pay that bail bondsmen $500 to loan that money for a few weeks. This works out great for the bondsmen as a high interest loan. For the courts it gives them free enforcement to pick up people who skip court. Great for everyone except the people being arrested. This is similar to other punitive fines, inconveniences, and 'fees' used to extract money from people who cannot fight back. See DUI fees, disproportionate juvenile sentencing, voting rights removal, prison lobbyists, etc for more details.",4

question: Why does congress have a 13% approval rate but incumbents are re-elected at a rate of 90%. ,"answer: I worked on the campaign trail for nearly a decade, so I can tell you the three most interesting reasons:  \n\n1. The Optimism Gap - People hate Congress but love their Congressman.  This is less true than it used to be but the dynamic still holds.  While Congress is less popular than the King of England at the time of the Revolutionary War, most members of Congress get something like 60-70% approval in their home district.  This high level of approval among active voters is primarily due to the gerrymandering of districts (i.e. politicians choose the voters, not the other way around).  However, widespread voter apathy also contributes to this dynamic because most polls only take into account the opinions of people planning on voting (the first question in most polls is:  Are you planning on voting?  No = goodbye).  Therefore, the positive reviews of the politician's active supporters disproportionately skew polling and ignore the potentially negative opinions of inactive voters that exist in the population.  \n\n2. PAC Checks - Most Political Action Committees (PACs) have a rule that they only give money to incumbent members of Congress. It's not just that the guy with the most money wins something like 95% of the time, it's also that most of the money flows to incumbents specifically.  So while the challenger is phone calling every one of their friends for $100 or asking for $25 in an email to build their campaign from scratch and then later spending 5-7 hours/day 5-7 day/week raising money by cold-calling rich donors, politicians already elected to Congress get multiple $5000 checks handed to them at lunches and happy hours in DC.  The incumbents-only rule is especially true of corporate PACs and rarely broken (only when it's obvious the challenger will win).  \n\n3. Franking - In the budget for every member of Congress is an allotment of money for substantial amounts of postage and constituent contact, known as ""franking"".  Essentially, elected member of Congress get to mail their voters for free, telling them how awesome they are and how much amazing legislation they've passed (or stopped).  It's like a low-tech advertising budget for incumbent Congressmen (though some offices have even used franking dollars to run online ads).  This really entrenches incumbents even further because they are constantly corresponding with constituents and doing them favors, which tit-for-tat picks them up additional support at the polls.  Challengers face an uphill battle in gaining similar name recognition and popularity among the population because they have to do it all with their campaign.  Incumbents get to use their office and the campaign to make their case for why they are a good member of Congress who should be re-elected.\n\nWait, this isn't ELI50?  Oops, my bad.  Hope it helps!\n\nPS.  It's really interesting to combine the 13% approval of Congress with the Gallup poll result showing 87% of Americans believe reducing government corruption is extremely or very important (making it a top 3 issue).  I wonder if the 13% of people is the same in both cases - approve of Congress and believe corruption is not a problem.  Who the hell are those people?\n\ntl;dr - Congress sucks, but incumbents got the votes, the money, and the favors.","answer: ""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter."" - Winston Churchill",1.5

","answer: Edit: Alright, sorry for coming across as patronizing. The gist of it is that it's a response to a sense of belonging most humans have.

What do you call the ""batter"" in kickball, anyway?), there is a sense that we all contributed to something bigger than ourselves and our friends will like us more. This makes your team even more separate from the other team, and you want to get along with your team more than you do with the other.

"question: What would you see, feel, and hear if a nuclear bomb was dropped 10-15 miles away?I really want to know what would happen if a nuke was dropped 10-15 miles away. I want to know everything I would see or hear and how everything would feel. Would there be a rumbling and bright light, with the mushroom cloud above? Would I instantly evaporate?  ","answer: It would depend on the size of the nuclear weapon. The [nukemap website](_URL_0_) allows you to see how large the blast radius would be for various nuclear payloads.\n\nSo for example if you're talking about a 15 kiloton bomb, such as was used at Hiroshima, then from 15 miles away you'd certainly see the flash, hear the explosion, and see the mushroom cloud, but you'd be unlikely to suffer any physical damage. The biggest threat would come from remaining in the area for several weeks afterwards and so coming into contact with the nuclear fallout (dust, ash, and other debris that is radioactive).\n\nOn the other hand if the largest ever US nuclear bomb (15 megatons) was detonated, then at 15 miles you'd still be within the thermal radiation (= heat) zone. There'd probably be enough power still in the blast pressure to knock you off your feet, and exposed areas of skin would likely be burned. If you'd been looking directly at the explosion you'd almost certainly have been blinded. Unless you leave the area *very* quickly you'll probably receive a fatal dose of radiation from the fallout and will die of radiation sickness in 14-28 days.\n\nThe USSR had plans for bombs of at least up to 100 megatons, the blast pressure from which would have almost certainly instantly killed anyone within about 20 miles of the detonation site. I'm not sure if warheads of this power were ever actually created, though.",answer: I've been told by a weapons designer that there is no upper limit to how large you can make a H-bomb.

"question: VPNs and Proxiesas well as the pros/cons, and whether or not they will be able to facilitate me doing whatever the hell I please online, despite any impending, fascist legislation\n\nedit: I noticed that VPNs had already been addressed earlier...I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol.. ","answer: Think of your Internet service provider like a concerned parent. They may be strict or they may not care what you do unless you draw a lot of attention to yourself. Either way they tend to try and keep an eye on what you are doing and listen out for trouble when you are within earshot but out of sight. \n\nWhen you play outside or up in your room you call out to your brother asking him to do stuff that is part of the game you are playing. Your parents hear this and will notice if you ask him to do something naughty that they would not like. \n\nA VPN is like having two foreign exchange students staying in the house for the summer. Now you can whisper to one German kid what you want and he can shout that in German to the other German kid who then speaks or shouts the English version to your brother. \n\nYour parents know something is being shouted back and forth between you and your brother but since they don't speak German they don't have a clue what is being said. They know what the second German kid is saying because he uses English but they don't know if he is speaking for you or for some other kid because lots of kids use the German kids this way. \n\nThe best German kids to use for this would be German kids with a short term memory problem. After a few minutes they forget what they were told and who said it to them. Now even if the parents ask the German kids what was going on and who was involved they honestly don't know. \n\nSome kids who are doing nothing naughty at all might choose to do this thing with the German kids just for the sake of having privacy or to make it harder for the parents to figure out which other kids are being naughty. \n\nNow, other people in the neighborhood listening in only hear the German kid shouting and have no clue who is whispering in his ear because if you recall he provides this service to lots of different kids. If a house gets toilet papered the only thing that the neighbor who owns that house can do is ask the German kid questions or ask all local parents if their kids were the ones who planned the prank. \n\nIf the German kid has a memory loss and your parents only heard German which they don't understand then no one can point the finger at you. Your parents know you said something and for how long you spoke but not what was said. \n\nIn the above example the two German kids are the encrypted tunnel and the second German kid is the proxy. To the world at large the second German kid is the one asking questions or giving instructions but he is really a ""proxy"", simply relaying what you want. The short term memory problem is similar to VPN servers that don't keep log files. The German language is the encryption used to cover your tracks.","answer: > I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol..\n\nA proxy is 'another server' through which you do all of your browsing.  So in a default situation, you are 'directly connected'.  You browse to a website and your ISP's servers handle this for you.  When you hit reddit, reddit can store your IP address or any information against you.  Also your ISP knows that you went to _URL_1_.  Oh and if reddit decides to show you one of those adverts, you'll see a ""meet hot girls in  < yourarea >  tonight!""\n\nWhen you introduce a proxy, it forwards the request for you.  You are telling the proxy 'I want _URL_1_' and the proxy server goes out, gets it for you and sends it back.  That makes a big difference.  That means that if you browse to reddit using a proxy, reddit sees the proxy's IP address.  If it does an IP-address-to-geographical-location-lookup, it will think you are wherever the proxy server is, rather than your actual location, so it might say ""meet girls in [low earth orbit](_URL_0_) tonight!"".  There are of course many different types of proxies, and some proxies will forward your IP address to the server, others will hide it for you and anonymize you as much as possible.  \n\nExample usage: the front page of reddit almost always has some Colbert video clip which everyone is celebrating together and you are left out because you are a pitiful foreigner.  Well, you could go through a proxy based in the US.  Because Colbert's website sees the proxy's IP address, it may think you are in the US and let you watch the video.\n\nOther examples, suppose you want to visit a website which you are not comfortable leaving your 'information' on.  Think torrent sites.  You went to a torrent site and downloaded a car.  A few days later, authorities seize their servers and your IP address is on their web server logs.  They can find you then.  So what some people do is they browse the torrent site through a proxy and download a car.  When the servers are seized, all the authorities see are the proxy's IP address.  Whether or not they can get YOUR IP address from that proxy server depends on the proxy server owner.  The owner may choose to not store any info about you at all and the owner may choose to store the info.",4

Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves.

The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.\n\nBut if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.\n\nOn to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?\n\nA VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel  &  routes all your internet traffic through that.\n\nSo instead of seeing:\n\n* workacct1484 connects to _URL_1_ \n* workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad\n* workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from  < nodes > \n\nmy ISP instead sees:\n\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to  < Server > \n\nSo my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they *could* sell my browsing data, it would be useless.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_0_)\n\nNow you might say to yourself, ""Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue  &  subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?""\n\nYes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:\n\n* MPAA sues  &  demands VPN logs\n* VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.\n* MPAA curses\n\nNow if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.\n\nHow do we get around this? TOR:\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nTOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.\n\nWhat does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well you don't connect to _URL_1_. do a traceroute to even _URL_2_  &  you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_3_)\n\nThis does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first  &  last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is **NOT** easy, but it *CAN* be done.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSo if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.\n\nSecond get a VPN.\n\nThird use TOR over that VPN.\n\nFourth, start calling your representatives  &  telling them how you feel, then GET OUT  &  VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.\n\nFinally, realize you lack the money  &  expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nAnd finally what does this mean for you?\n\nFor the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. \n\n#GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.\n\nThey are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.\n\nBut why should you care?\n\nBecause these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data  &  sees you looking for a new job  &  fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history  &  sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to  < Local Credit Union > .com and now can focus their attack.\n\nIf you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in ""private"" browsing modes.\n\nAnd because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not ""free"" and there are no realistic competitive options.\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.",3

"question: Why does my house feel like an arctic wasteland when the thermostat is set at 60°, yet when it's 60° outside, I'ts extremely comfortable?My house and the outside are the exact same temp right now...why does the outside feel warmer? ","answer: I imagine you're less active when at home, so your body is producing less heat. That, and sunlight, of course.","answer: Might also have to do with relative humidity. Normally in the winter the air is much dryer (notice how much more static electricity is on freshly dried clothes in the winter as oppose to the summer?). Anyways, the more relative humidity there is the hotter the air feels to you because it cannot accept as much perspiration. Similar to how people say places like Vegas and Phoenix had ""dry heat"" a ""dry cold"" will feel much cooler than a cold temperature with higher humidity. Also, if you look at psychometric charts you'll notice that cold air is naturally less humid. Therefore, when you're heating the cold outside air in your house, and not adding humidity the air will feel colder at 60 degrees than air that's outside at the same temp. Sorry for such a long answer but I finally got a chance to use some of that HVAC knowledge from my building mechanical systems class.",4
question: Why does salt preserve foods like meat? Can't bacteria live in salt? ,answer: Salt sucks the water out of the cells via osmosis. Compare with drying or smoking meat. Bacteria growth is highly restricted in dehydrated environment.,"answer: Bacteria 'generally' need oxygen, a safe pH, moisture, and favorable temperature to survive/grow. Salt is hydrophilic, so it removes the moisture from things that have moisture. When you salt something, you are technically starting a 'cooking' process. Check out books on cooking theory, it will open your mind as to what kinds of things you can do to create awesome dishes. Learning a solid cooking theory is kind of like learning the fundementals of how to draw. Once you learn your theory, you can apply it to all sorts of food based on what they are made up of (is it a watery veggie, is it a starchy veggie, is it a solid fruit, does it break down when you add heat very quickly, etc) and it will make it easier to cook things that you haven't worked with before. You can use theory to really focus on creativity rather than copying things you find online without knowing why you add the salt to and wrap the sliced zuchinni with paper towels before grilling it.",4
question: Why is there a blood shortage? Hospitals charge like $800 per unit. Why don't they pay $250 for a donation. Everyone would donate. ELI5 ,"answer: Guess I am late to this party but it is the area of my expertise.\n\nThere is no over-arching, on-going national blood shortage.  Blood usage for non-trauma purposes and the total number of units of blood being collected is falling nation wide.  Orthopedic surgery in particular has gone from 6-7 units of blood to rarely needing any for lots of common procedures over the past 20 years.  The Red Cross has actually been shutting down blood banks and consolidating.  Of course lower total usage means lower standing inventory levels means less ability to absorb spikes.  Harder forecasting, apparent shortages.\n\nShelf life and storage capacity are both quite low, making regional inventory levels vulnerable.  A bag of blood is legal for 35 to 42 days depending on what they mix in it, but it's not like it's new and shiny until midnight on the 35th day and then turns green.  In reality doctors know it's badly degrading after two weeks or so.  Blood that is getting older will preferably only be used in emergencies when nothing else compatible is found.\n\nLots of blood gets thrown out.  It expires.  It goes out of temperature range during transport.  The container is compromised.  Or it's ordered and never used.  (Once it's out of the controlled environment of the hospital blood bank and sitting on a cart in the ER for hours they're not allowed to just take it back and toss it in the fridge for someone else, it is trash.)  So the cost of one is also covering the cost of the lost overhead expense on unused units.  (Affects what it would be reasonable to be able to pay per-donation.  I don't work on the hospital side, don't know a firm number of what % collected units go unused nationally.)\n\nFor donors who are compensated in the US (that is, plasma) the protocols are more stringent, there is a lot of extra work the clinic is required to do to make sure you're a legitimate donor.  Blood Banks aren't set up for this, it's more work, more staff.  Some of the rules used to make compensated plasma donations acceptable just don't really translate onto blood banking.  Imagine the task and cost of developing a protocol to assert a compensated donation is safe for use and getting it past the US FDA...!","answer: My company gives us PTO (paid time off) to donate blood. If we give three times in a fiscal year, we get one day. If we give six times (which is the max you can give), we get two. My company also has a policy allowing us to sell back PTO during open enrollment. As such, I can sell back the two days I earn and get paid a decent chunk for each time I donate. \n\nI never before gave blood before working for this company... Never had the incentive. I'm proof that paying for donors works.",3

"question: Why does everyone in the US seem to have an AC system?Even in areas with very mild climates? I know, weird question but I'm not from the US. I travel a lot and I've been to the US a few times. It seems to be the only country where at least 9 out of 10 people have an AC system, even in small cheap apartments in mild climate states. Most places only have them in like big supermarkets and buildings, if any at all.\n\nWhenever I tell a friend from the US I deal with 35C+ (95F+) temperatures without an AC they're usually baffled that I don't have an AC. Meanwhile I'm baffled they do, lol.\n\nHow come? Pretty much every hot country I've been to people just deal with 40C+ (104F+) temperatures without an AC system. Yet every single person I know with no exceptions from the US has an AC.\n\nAlso, doesn't this have some bad side effects for mother nature when every single house and apartment in tightly packed areas has an AC? And doesn't it make people more weak and sensitive to hot temperatures? Especially when they walk from a cooled house into a really hot outside? That sudden change would make my circulatory go all wonky lol.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the answers. I get the whole: ""Because it's hot and humid!"" reasoning, but there's many countries where it's a lot more hot and humid that don't plonk ACs everywhere. There has to be some event or trigger that caused ACs to popularize so much in the US other than: ""Everyone outside 'Murrica is dumb for not having ACs!"" lol. I'm not looking for the reason why people have an AC, that one is pretty obvious. I'm trying to figure out why almost everyone in the US does, but other places don't.\n\nBy the way, I wasn't negatively judging the US for having ACs everywhere, I find it rather good and wish more places were like that since I've experienced large scale heatwave deaths in 45C+/90%+ humidity countries, mostly elderly people.

question: How can someone be too over qualified for a job and not be hired for that reason?[removed] ,"answer: One of the main reasons someone who is overqualified for a role won't be hired for that reason is that the employer is concerned they will get bored of it too quickly and leave, as they may not find it challenging/stimulating enough. Also, the employer may be worried they'll continue to search for a better job with higher pay that they could get with their qualifications, so that's another way they risk losing the employee.","answer: It costs an employer money to hire an employee.  They have to spend time looking for them, and then spend time training them. They also come to rely on that employee to be there to do work.  \n\nOverqualified employees are seen as more likely to leave a job when they have the opportunity to do so. As a result, all of those sunk costs are more likely to be lost to the employer faster than with a qualified employee.  \n\nBeyond that, there are also considerations of morale and fit. Although certainly not often the case, it happens that ""overqualified"" people might think that a job is beneath them and therefore not take that job or others at that level seriously.  This can lead to bad work and even poison the whole work environment. \n\nThose are the two principal reasons that this can be an issue.",5

"question: What is happening when people ""speak in tongues""?I grew up in a christian household and saw people do this all the time at church.

I imagine people know they're not really feeling anything but go along with the process to fit in with the group - hoping one day it would ""really"" happen for them? ","answer: If you actually look into the times speaking in tongues is mentioned in the bible. It says that the men that were speaking in tongues were just speaking a different human language that they had not learned. \n\nThe reason for this is because at that time there was very few Christians and very few who could speak another language. \n\nWhen the men who experienced this started speaking in tongues they were visiting a race that had never heard of God before. That is why the holy spirit entered them and allowed them to be understood by that other race. \n\nThere is nothing in the bible that says it is a language that only God can understand. It also says if someone is to start speaking I tongues there is supposed to be a translator for that language with him. \n\nIf someone in a Pentecostal church starts blurting out random noises and calls it speaking in tongues, they are lying because it will not happen today.",answer: Religious people believe that the Holy Spirit takes over the person and they begin speaking in tongues which is basically an unrecognized language of God.\n\nThe non-religious (or less extreme) tend to believe that speaking in tongues is entirely fake in the same way that exorcisms are fake.,4

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? ","answer: The idea that you don't talk about Money is a very, very old idea.  It predates the US.  I don't know if it originated in England, or if its even older, but it been around a while.  \n\nYou might have heard of a [Window Tax](_URL_0_).  This was implemented in both England and France a few hundred years ago as a form of an income tax.  The idea being that the more windows a person had in their house, the more income they had an the more taxes they could pay.  Why not just have an income tax?  Well, people didn't talk about money, and that included telling the gov't what you made (or the gov't asking).  \n\nSo, how did this ""don't talk about money"" come about?  Well, I'm not totally sure.  One thing you need to consider is that historically, class was not about money.  Today we think of a rich class, and a poor class.  But, in England and France, a Poor noble man was of higher ""Class"" than merchant with a thousand times more money.  Those who worked for money, doctors, lawyers, and merchants were of the middle class.  The upper class DID NOT WORK.    \n\nSo, the idea that you didn't talk about money may have been about hiding the elephant in the room when the upper class got together.  A Baron wouldn't want to insult a Duke by discussing how much more money he had, when the Duke was his social better.  \n\nBut, in the US, we don't have the same concept of class. But, in general, the idea of not talking about money still comes into play.  I say in general because different groups feel differently.  Old money families from New England or the South are going to be the most closeted.  Money is discussed more freely in other areas of the country, and in middle class and poor families.  \n\nBut, that still doesn't answer why.  As to why, I'm going to make a guess.  Kinda like when talking about religion, it's really easy to insult someone.  It's a very emotional topic.  Some people feel embarrassed they don't have enough.  Others feel embarrassed that they have too much.  When people do talk about money, epically with regards to how much THEY make, it's easy to assume they are bragging or complaining.  Neither of which are very couth.  \n\nEven when discussing things discretely, it can cause problems.  Things got temporary uncomfortable between me and a friend when he found out how much money I made.  He thought we made about the same amount ... we didn't.  So, better to keep a lid on it.",answer: i would have probably never become a software developer if my friends didnt tell me their salaries,2

It covers both the science of stars and galaxies and the technology to measure them.\n\nAstrophysics is the study of how things in space follow the laws of physics to do what they do.\n\nCosmology is the study of how the universe came to be, and why it is like it is.","answer: Cosmology is the study of the cosmos itself (e.g. the expansion of space, the Big Bang, relativity), and astrophysics is the study of the objects in the cosmos (e.g. how stars work and galaxies form). There's a lot of overlap; for example, the astrophysical problem of how galaxies can rotate so fast without tearing apart introduces the cosmological problem of what dark matter is and how it got here.\n\nModern astronomy might as well be called ""observational astrophysics""; it's about looking at what things in space are doing and figuring out why. An astronomer will generally concern himself with finding data that can test astrophysical/cosmological theories and hypotheses.",4.5
"question: Why does my house feel like an arctic wasteland when the thermostat is set at 60°, yet when it's 60° outside, I'ts extremely comfortable?My house and the outside are the exact same temp right now...why does the outside feel warmer? ","answer: It really does a have a lot more to do with humidity than direct sunlight. Have you been out west where it's a dry heat and then felt the cooler temperature yet much more humid Deep South swamp heat? The humidity feels worse. A/C removes moisture, which is why it defrosts the inside of a car window faster when you turn the A/C on in conjunction with the defrost. Also the humidity is why it feels so much hotter in a sauna.\n\nSource: Used to work in HVAC.",answer: Relative humidity levels. Air Conditioning removes Humidity. High humidity levels make you feel warm and sticky. So despite both being 60 degrees the higher relative humidity outside makes it feel warmer than the air Conditioned space. Why do you think it is called air Conditioning? You are conditioning the air by removing the humidity. A/c primarily removes humidity/latent heat and Secondarily removes measurable heat/temperature. \n\nJust a humble HVAC tech.,5

Because, adjusting for inflation, the most recent film in the top 10 grossing is Titanic, in 1997, and the top grossing film of all time is Gone With the Wind.\n\nsource: _URL_4_\n\nAlso, piracy could have slowed their growth, even if it didn't have enough impact to negate their growth entirely.","answer: I think a big issue is that the films making big box office sales are the epic films and sequels that people are willing to pay for. Other movies that might not be established franchises or big screen suited action movies or 3d epics are easier to stream online, pirated or not.

Yet every single person I know with no exceptions from the US has an AC.\n\nAlso, doesn't this have some bad side effects for mother nature when every single house and apartment in tightly packed areas has an AC?

I get the whole: ""Because it's hot and humid!"" reasoning, but there's many countries where it's a lot more hot and humid that don't plonk ACs everywhere.

question: How exactly does our body inform us that we need to pee? ,"answer: Since this hasn't been described yet: continence and voiding are dictated by the autonomic nervous system. The bladder has stretch receptors (mechanoreceptors) that give input to the autonomic system. The dominant autonomic tone is a result of the amount of stretch input (little stretch of bladder - >  sympathetic tone, detrusor muscle and internal sphincter are inhibited, bladder is allowed to fill; more stretch - >  parasympathetic tone, detrusor and internal sphincter stimulated, voiding occurs). In infants and some people with spinal cord injury, this is the only control of the bladder. This is refered to as ""neurogenic"" - voiding occurs upon sufficient stretch. Beginning in childhood, the central nervous system is involved to allow for conscious control of voiding. The urge to pee comes from afferent input to the pontine micturition center.","answer: What about when you're dehydrated?\n\nI've had times where I've been dehydrated, or even when I take some vitamins, where I'll get the urge to pee, but will have a lot less volume than an average urination.\n\nAre there receptors that just say ""get this nasty shit out of here""?",2

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? ","answer: Withing a large organization, salary errors crop up for many reasons.  This is where a person's salary is not correctly matched to their contribution.  If salaries were published, then these errors would be revealed and morale would suffer, and that would be bad for the organization.  Publishing salaries would lead to swifter fixes for the errors, and that would be good for the company.  There is not universal agreement on each employee's level of contribution, so the perception of salary error is inescapable when salaries are published.\n\nCompanies promote the salary taboo to avoid the negative consequences of publishing salary errors, real or perceived.\n\nEmployees might benefit from salary publishing, for example, by creating a more efficient job market.  But, many individuals benefit from hiding their own salary.  For example, hiding salary might help individuals with lower than average salary by making them appear more successful than they are.  Hiding salary might help individuals with higher than average salary by making it easier for them to fit in with others.\n\nSo, both the individuals and the companies that pay them have a shared interest in keeping salaries secret.

"question: Why do so many European countries show hatred towards the European Union (like the UK), even though it has lead to the most peaceful and stable period in European history?[removed] ","answer: One of the reasons is that EU tries to make EU as an united nation. EU has already huge authority over it's member countries. Some unknown force at Brussels is telling you that you can't grow more than X amounts of crop/year as an example. EU should not have an authority over the laws of any nation.\n\n\n\nThen many people does not like Euro at all, since it actually has hurt the economy of smaller countries than actually helped them.","answer: One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU.\n\nCountries in the EU have to let people from other EU countries live and work there with no restrictions. This has resulted in a large number of people coming from less wealthy countries such as Poland coming to live in the wealthier ones including the UK.\n\nSome people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. Although this is statistically not true in the average case.\n\nOther people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment. However now many British businesses and organisations are likely to face a shortage of workers.\n\nAnd finally some people don't like how society has changed due to immigration. There are many more non-English speakers than there used to be, and there are lots of shops around catering to various immigrant groups.

Here in the USA we have ""split service"". 120/240vac. 2 legs come into the house from the same phase at 120 v leg to ground. Leg to leg however is 240v. We plug our toaster into 120v but our clothes dryer (and other things) into 240v. As to why, the other examples given make sense... lightbulb, tesla, and such. But I will say with 120v being less pressure, while higher gauge wire is required in the home it is nicer to be shocked by 120v instead of 240v. Not to mention our wire sizes for home are 14, 12, 10, and I forget for the clothes dryer but I think that's like 2. As far as the grid goes, that's usually 2 aut, 3 strand from the transformer to the house. Before the transformer depending on how old the part of the grid is you either have 4kv or 13kv. 13 is the more common one these days but you will find 4kv in some places still.","answer: The higher the voltage, the thinner gauge wire that can be used due to less resistance. Higher voltages are more dangerous, but cheaper to implement. In very poor countries, 440V is sometimes used (""illegally"") to reduce the cost of the wiring even further.\n\nAlso, Japan is also on 110V.",4

question: if the aim of the prison system is to reintegrate felons into society why are they branded for life in such a way that it makes it nearly impossible to get a job?[removed] ,"answer: Consider that in business, you ideally want your customers to come back again and again. Then consider that private prisons are businesses. Then consider how easy it is for them to just kinda pretend to be aiming to rehabilitate. Now look back at the prison system, and it all makes disturbing sense. Imo this is at least part of why gangs and drugs seem to be completely tolerated, what better way to ensure the prisoner keeps in contact with their criminal side (or gets even more drawn in).","answer: Much of it has to do with how the government believes society should deal with crime. If you believe people are at their core natures shitty, then those people can't be rehabilitated in order to save them from themselves. The only hope is that you provide enough a deterrent with dire consequences to prevent them from doing crime, as bad people only respect power.  Thomas Hobbes basically put this idea forward in *The Leviathan.*\n\nIf you believe people are innocent and angelic at birth, as Jean Jeaque Rosseau did, and that society corrupts them, then society should deal with crime through rehabilitation.  For what person would continue trying to make their rights wrong when everything around them continually reminds them of their mistakes and refuses to let them move on?  A primarily penalizing society would rob a good person of any hope of redemption, and he or she would fall back into despair and regret, giving up on doing the right thing.\n\nI myself believe Hobbes leans more toward the truth, but people don't have to be angels in order not to be devils.

question: Why is the accepted age of sexual relation/marriage so vastly different today than it was in the Middle Ages? Is it about life expectancy? What causes this societal shift? ,"answer: In the west it hasn't really changed that much between the middle ages and about the 1960s. After that, the age at which people got married slowly went up because women were expected to be ""established"" in a similar way to men to have a stable home life which took time. Otherwise, women usually got married late teens/early twenties and men a bit after that, because men had to establish careers and whatnot.\n\nWomen got married younger than that occasionally but there was usually a reason why. Marriages between powerful families would be arranged at a young age because marriages helped cement political alliances, so daughters would get married off ASAP if it would be politically advantageous. Other reasons would be extenuating circumstances, like a girl getting pregnant (even if she's 14, she can't have children out of wedlock). The first reason is probably why we think people got married much younger -- royalty and the like are written about much more than common people.","answer: 3 things: infant mortality, death in childbirth, and lack of a safety net.\n\nBefore a safety net, your children were your Medicare and Social Security. If you didn't have kids, you weren't going to have someone to care for you when you got too old to work. That was a huge problem, so people tried to maximize their chances of children who would outlive them.\n\nThis brings us to the other two points. Infant and child mortality used to be really high. In Ancient Rome, there was about a 50/50 chance of a kid living past their 10th birthday. So, if you wanted to have kids who survived into adulthood, you'd need to have a lot of children to ensure that some would survive. As a result, women needed to start having children as soon as they were fertile to maximize the chances. But, lots of women died in childbirth, meaning it was even more important to have kids as early as possible, so that the man could remarry and have more kids who would be able to survive and care for him in his old age.",4

question: how do most flamboyant gay guys sound so different then straight guys?

I don't sound like that either.  I reckon it's the same cultural factors, social environment, TV, etc that make everyone else sound the way they do.","answer: Male monozygotic (identical/single egg) twin here. My twin brother and I are the same height, weight, shoe size, and we share the same contact lens prescription. He is hetero and I am gay. We grew up in the same household and without any traumatic events, so should be a pretty good case study. We're both turning 29 this year.\n\nThe affect/dialect, along with the mannerisms, are both a nature and nurture development:\n-visual gender role modelling is a critical factor, if not the ""trigger"" factor\n-a chemical or biological change occurs pre-10 that strengthens/supplements the initial gender role modelling\n-there is most definitely a biological point of no return sometime pre-puberty\n\nThis would account for the difference in the pitch of my brother and my voice despite our diaphragms, chests, ribs, etc sharing the same measurements. \nNotes: \n-My brother role modeled our father, I did not\n-Neither of us exhibits a gay dialect, as this as unlearned/compensated for at a young age on my part, but I definitely noticed the beginnings of both a gay affect and manner in myself at around 13 \n\nA developed gay man does not adopt the affect or mannerisms for social reasons. Pre-10 gay male children are a great example of this, as they frequently exhibit the affect and mannerisms before learning social awareness.\n\nBut maybe the most important argument I can make here is that if you're a gay male who speaks and acts outwardly like a hetero male, a conscious effort is being made to reduce the manner/dialect. You can imagine it like drinking too much caffeine. That feeling of being ""wired"" is similar to the lack of control a gay male has over their affect or mannerisms. Any corrective behaviour is usually learned through visual role modelling of masculine figures, which is why it's not uncommon to see a gay male overcorrecting with hypermasculine voice and body language. After dating many gay men from both the Vancouver and Seattle areas, I can tell you that not one of them was without a slight gay affect in their most relaxed environment, and most of them claim initially to be straight acting - the only difference is self awareness.",4

"question: How can Roman bridges be still standing after 2000 years, but my 10 year old concrete driveway is cracking? ","answer: Roman concrete and modern concrete differ in three important ways: steel reinforcement, volcanic ash, and age. \n\nRoman concrete was made with volcanic ash, which is a very fine powder. The smaller particles of ash makes the pores in the concrete (tiny spaces between particles) very small. This prevents water from soaking into the concrete, which breaks it down and erodes it. \n\nConcrete takes a short time to set, but a long time to cure. When it's set, it's hard, but basically only because it's dry. As the concrete cures, it undergoes a chemical change that makes it tougher. The longer it cures, the tougher it gets. \n\nThis is why your driveway doesn't last (plus the fact that Roman concrete didn't have tons of car constantly moving on it).\n\nModern bridges also use steel reinforcement bars, which, when exposed to the caustic concrete, rust. Rusting steel expands, which puts pressure on the concrete from the inside. \n\nTl;Dr They're not the same kind of concrete.","answer: Because General Maximus threatened that bridge with his legion in 45 ad.  \n\n""Stand, bridge!

"question: How does the slant of the blade on a guillotine lead to a cleaner cut?Does it have something to do with pressure, or am I way off here? ","answer: I believe it is generally about combining the effects of slicing through an object and chopping through it.\n\nFirst we need to think of the concept of sharpness, where a surface is sharp when it has as small a surface area making contact with another surface. A needle is sharper than a blade, because it only makes contact at a single point, but a blade is more effective at cutting because the linear path of the edge creates a clean straight path that the rest of the blade can continue to be drawn through when cutting, whereas the point of the needle digs into the surface it's penetrating and resists being drawn in any direction.\n\nChopping can be thought of as applying a direct pressure of a bladed edge on a surface, hoping for the kinetic energy of the blade, and the sharpness of the cutting surface to drive a wedge far enough through the object to sever it. Chopping action basically stops once all the kinetic energy has been imparted, and you have to pull the blade back out and try again if you didn't make it all the way through. The less sharp the blade, and the more tough the surface, the less likely it'll get through, and probably just crush it somewhat.\n\nSlicing, on the other hand, is about drawing a sharp edge across the surface, trying to minimize the amount of edge-to-surface contact as possible (which effectively increases the sharpness), and allows more of the length of the blade to be used in the cutting action. Basically, slicing can be conducted for the full length of the blade, and the less of the blade making contact at any given time means the slicing is more effective. Slicing is most effective when the direction of the cut is not traveling straight through the surface, but drawing against it at an angle.\n\nYou can try this, take a pair of scissors or a straight edged knife, place one edge of the blade flat against a piece of paper and try to cut it just by driving the edge straight through. If this doesn't work so well, try placing the blade against the edge of the paper (minimizing the contact surface) and drawing the blade through it. It should slice much more easily this way.\n\nNow, onto Guillotines. They work by combining both chopping and slicing. The momentum of the blade falling is the chop. The angle of the blade allows the slicing action to be concentrated on a single point of the neck at any given time, and extends the length of the blade during the slice as it both drives and draws through. It also makes the direction of most resistance no longer ~~perpendicular~~ directly opposed to the blade as it moves, which is what would make it most likely to resist the cutting action.\n\n**TL;DR**: momentum of blade = chopping, angle of blade = slicing + longer cutting edge + non-perpendicular angle of resistance. Chopping + slicing = quicker, cleaner, more effective cut","answer: Think of how you'd use a knife to cut something tough in the kitchen, like say, a potato.  Now, you could swing the knife forcefully to chop it in half, but  unless you're very good, you're not going to cut exactly where you wanted to, you'll also risk chopping off your fingers or damaging your knife, which would be bad.  The proper way to slice is to place the blade on the item in question, and apply regular downward pressure while pulling/pushing the blade towards/away from you.  This lets the blade act like a blade rather than just a wedge.  The principle is the same with the guillotine.  The lower part of the blade makes contact with the chap's neck first, and because the blade is slanted, it slides *relatively* along his neck.   The point of contact between the blade and the neck moves in 2 dimensions, rather than just one, even though the blade is only moving in one dimension.",4.5
question: Why do microwaves cook the stuff on the outside of the plate more completely while the stuff in the middle remains cold? ,"answer: The type of the radiation used is only capable of penetrating ""skin deep.""

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? ","answer: We had a guy in our circle who was a great friend. You could tell he was a little uncomfortable about talking about what he did for a living when pressed. We all bitched about our jobs to each other.  He always had time to help people move, build something, or hang out... We began to wonder how he had so much time and lived so comfortably.  At some point someone found out he doesn't work at all and what he said he did for a living was more like a hobby. The guy was a multimillionaire somehow because of his wife's money.  They both lived very comfortably off of investment income in an aging town with a poor standard of living.\n\nIt changed everything between us all. A lot of the guys straight up started asking for cash, leveraging their friendship. There was often jokes about him being a bum with all the luck in the world, ""must be nice"" became a motto.\n\nEventually the entire families of everyone found out, including children. This meant everyone everywhere knew, including his neighbors. One of his neighbors sued him after slipping on his sidewalk while walking his dog and got some kind of ridiculous payout.  There was some controversy in the community about it because the sidewalk was shoveled, was salted a few hours earlier and it was snowing still. The neighbor pressed hard and fast. Quietly some of the guys rooted against our friend and started making judgments on how he was lazy and it was his fault.\n\nCouple of the guys really resented him and it got a little toxic with personal insults directly relating to money and what we were all doing with our lives vs this guy sitting on his ass with a sugar momma.\n\nHe moved and built his dream home somewhere and hasn't kept up with any of us as far as I know, and I say good for him.

"question: Why do we feel more uncomfortable viewing sex than viewing violence when others are around us? Given that sex is more natural than violence, shouldn't it be the opposite?[removed] ","answer: I think sex is kind of way more personal to people, and any individual might get weirded out about sharing their views / connecting with people on it.  Whereas violence is everywhere (sex is too, but strictly talking exposure), just as a casual thing, life is violent probably way more often than its sexy.  I like Bruce Campbell said ""You can show a breast being cut off, but you can't show it being kissed""","answer: Well for the most part it has to do with cultural expectations and other stuff. Some places have lots more sex on tv and less violence on tv for cultural reasons (looking at u germany). \n\n*This is my very uneducated take on it from an individual level*. -- But i guess you could also describe the phenomena using neurology and psychology.

"question: Does passing out have any advantages?Passing out from an uncomfortable experience, heat exhaustion or pain seems to have no advantage. Is there any benefit? ","answer: pain and the like can result in vasoconstriction - blood vessels squeezing tighter. This can reduce the flow of blood to your brain. When this happens, you pass out. Once laying down the bloodflow normalizes and you immediately wake back up.\n\nStrong emotional reactions can trigger these events as well, but its not entirely clear why. But the underlying physical mechanism is the same.","answer: Passing out protects your body from excessive stress or injury. If you are forced to continue (in action movies or sci fi they sometimes have people who allegedly can't feel pain or can run at top speed forever) cells would run out of energy and joints can get injured.\n\nSometimes it's a system shut down. A punch or blow that causes your brain to hit the side of the skull (usually your brain is floating in a liquid which protects it from concussions) which can overwhelm it and cause it to shut down (like rebooting your PC but not exactly)\n\nAnother could be an interruption of how your biology needs to function. Think about a sleeper hold. Your brain needs a constant supply of blood to stay functional. Squeezing the carotid arteries cuts blood from the brain and it shuts down. But this example has less to do with protecting your body than a system shutdown, like pulling the power cord to your computer.",4
"question: How are prescription drug makes able to sell drugs at such absurd markups, and is there anything consumers can do to change it?[removed] ","answer: The root of this is supply and demand, particularly enhanced by lack of competition.\n\nDemand for medication is very high. It's being purchased because it's needed, or because it's required to have on hand. Supply is very limited, because just one entity is allowed to make it, because they funded or bought the research that established certain intellectual property: the ""recipe"" for that medication.\n\nIn that scenario, the market will still buy the product as the price gets higher. So, the company produces and sells the amount that they can produce and sell at the best rate of return on their investment (and what they can afford to produce with available capital).\n\nThis is single bottom line mentality.  Other concepts, such as Triple Bottom Line (""people, planet, profits""), seek to not always maximize profit if they can trade it for worthwhile progress on their ""people"" and ""planet"" metrics. I wouldn't say that the consumer can always choose a triple bottom line company to buy medication from (although if it is available, it might be worth extra money to you, or at least you could choose it).  I suppose the least you could do is to demand legislation (and support it when it arrives by writing lawmakers or testifying for it) that opens the market up to competition by breaking down intellectual property barriers so that more than one entity can produce a medication.  Just be aware that as the profits in the pharmaceutical research industry fall, the money available to do that pharmaceudical research is also impacted.  Think if it this way: with low market competition, they will try to make it as expensive as possible.  With high market competition, they will try to make it as *cheap* as possible, with everything that goes along with ""cheap"".","answer: Generally speaking, it costs a lot to bring a drug to market. R & D costs are high, and then the FDA puts it through a lengthy and costly evaluation process. So while it may be true that it is $1 worth of medicine, that ignores millions of dollars that went into the development that need to be recouped to turn a profit on the drug. The company gets a patent on the drug for a time that helps with that, but when it becomes generic the price will drop a good bit. \n\nGovernment intervention of various types could bring prices down, but too much intervention could end up disincentivizing R & D.",5
"question: Why do Death With Dignity laws allow people with incurable, untreatable physical illness to end their lives if they wish, but not for people with incurable, untreatable mental illness?(Throwaway account for fear of flame wars)\n\n\nWhy do states/countries with death with dignity laws allow patients who have incurable, untreatable physical illnesses the right to choose to die to avoid suffering, but don't extend that right to people with mental illness in the same position? I know that suicide is often an impulse decision for people with mental illness, and that some mental illnesses (psychosis, acute schizophrenia, etc) can easily impair a patient's judgment. Still, for people experiencing immense suffering from mental illness and for whom no treatment has been effective, in situations where this pain has a very high likelihood of continuing for the rest of the patient's life, why does it not fall under those law's goals to prevent suffering with incurable diseases? Sure, mental illness isn't going to outright physically kill a person, and new treatments might be found, but that might take many, many years, during which time the person is in incredible distress? If they're capable of making a rational decision, why are they denied that right?\n\n\nThanks for your answers.\n\n\nEDIT: There's been a lot of really good thoughtful conversation here. I do believe I forgot about the requirement for the physical illness to be terminal within six months, so my apologies there. I do wonder though, in regards to suicide and mental illness, as memory serves people facing certain diagnoses (I think BPD is one of them) are statistically much more likely to attempt suicide. People who make one attempt are statistically unlikely to try again, but for people who have attempted multiple times, I think there's a much higher probability of additional attempts and eventually a successful attempt, so that may factor in to how likely their illness is to be ""terminal."" Still, I definitely agree that a major revamping of the mental health care system is in order.  ","answer: I think the right to end your life should be legal regardless of your mental or physical condition.  I had a friend recently take his life. I knew this person for 20 years and for about 10 of those years he was depressed and had anxiety issues. He came from a  poor family and due to his mental issues he had no personal relationships or upper level connections for education or career paths.  \n\nHe left a note outlining his reasoning for taking his own life and I completely understood why he did it. He tried every medication and therapy technique to attempt to resolve his issues. After 10 years of getting nowhere, he honestly had no other logical decision.  He used a quick and painless method at the end. He scheduled an email to the local authorities and wore a tux so he would look decent when he was retrieved. When he did it, I had a deep sigh of relief because I knew he was in a better state. \n\nI think a law should be introduced which allows a person to either take their own life or allow doctors to anonymously assist the person by providing necessary medicine for a painless and quick death.  The criteria should contain items from the following:\n\n* Proof of a diagnosis of a mental condition from a certified professional\n* Documents which show the person's mental condition having negative effect on the person's life. This can include a poor work history, poor financial management, bad credit score, poor grades, etc.\n* Notarized signature of at least one immediate relative\n* No legal issues (Active court cases, alimony, active warrants, etc)\n* Enough money to cover any costs associated with the voluntary death and the processing afterwards or insurance which would cover it\n\nIf I were in a situation where my mental state would not allow me to be successful or happy after years of medication and therapy, instead of burdening my family or tax payers for medical bills, I would rather just end it and be happy.  I would rather see the tax payer money saved put into scholarships to reduce the cost of education for those who will be successful.\n\nYou could argue that someone in enough physical pain could not be in the right state of mind to end their life with a terminal illness.","answer: > \nIf they're capable of making a rationals decision, why are they denied that right?\n\nSimplified answer, they aren't considered rational decision makers in that area by virtue of a diagnosed illness. Suicidal ideation or aspiration is considered a symptom of the illness, not a legitimate rational desire.",3
question: How and why are books like The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men chosen for reading in English classes? ,"answer: I don't know, All I remember is that in secondary 5 (Quebec french school) I had to read ""Des souris et des hommes"" in french class and ""Les miserâb"" in english litterature at the same time... a whole semester hearing ""Jean Valjean"" in english when 100% of the students were native french speakers. Teachers do whatever they want I think.","answer: I'm probably too late for this shindig, but there's an important component I see many people missing, and this is, in my view, the most important reason we read books like Huck Finn, The Great Gatsby, and Pride and Prejudice.\n\nYes, part of the answer here is the 'canon', i.e. there's a (possibly arbitrary) group of central texts chosen by old white dudes with Oedipus complexes. Look at other comments for answers about the canon.\n\nNow, I have a problem with the 'canon' answer because it's overly simplified, and is often used as a false comfort. 'The Canon' is the answer people want to hear if they don't understand why they're being made to read *The Great Gatsby*. That is, if you're just bored by *The Great Gatsby*, it's comforting to say, ""Well, some boring old white dudes arbitrarily decided I should read this when really it's just boring drivel that has no relevance to modern life and that's Fitzgerald's fault, not mine, let's move on to Harry Potter. Fuck the canon, it's racist."" (The canon is, indeed, pretty racist, but let's move on)\n\n**Something I don't see people talking about, however, is literary tradition, which I see as the more significant reason to read writers like Fitzgerald and Steinbeck.**\n\nTo explain: writers read each other. Whom writers read and whom writers like will impact their own work. Toni Morrison's *Beloved* is illuminated if, afterwards, you read Faulkner. Morrison wrote a Ph.D. on Faulkner for cryin' out loud. That doesn't mean you can't read *Beloved* without *As I Lay Dying*; it simply means Beloved will be a different, and more interesting book if you do. You can't fully appreciate J.G. Ballard unless you also understand Joseph Conrad. J.G. Ballard is basically using the exact same metaphors as Conrad, just updated and less racist. He's admitted as such. If you read Virginia Woolf before you read Ursula K. Le Guin, you'll be amazed by the connections you'll make. The texts dance with each other. It doesn't matter that Le Guin writes Science Fiction and Woolf writes in the mode of Modernism--Le Guin has been heavily influenced by Woolf, and reading the two together is very enlightening.\n\nAnd then come the two giants of them all: Shakespeare and The Bible. Look, you can read literature without having read any Shakespeare or any of the Bible, but that doesn't mean you'll be erasing the ginormous impact these works have had on literature. In the most fundamental ways, the language of The Bible has seeped into the entire umbrella of English literature. Even if you don't know it as a writer, you're either adopting the ways The Bible uses words, or rebelling against it. No matter what, you're always responding to it. It doesn't even need to be purposeful on your part.\n\nSo, yes, there's an aspect of 'the canon', but the canon wasn't just chosen by stuffy old white men. It was also chosen by writers, and a writer worth their salt will have read from the canon, and will know what interests them, and what they think is missing. To track this progression can give us insight into the way dialogues in our culture develop. It isn't arbitrary that Toni Morrison is following in Faulkner's footsteps, and it certainly isn't because some old white dudes told her to and that was that.\n\nPart of the issue is that high school students don't necessarily have the perspective available to approach some of these texts, and it's often in high school where these texts are read. For example, what does an expedition down the misty Congo river have to offer to someone going into engineering, or politics, or environmental science? I think the reason a book like Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* evades us is because books like it are often taught in the wrong way.\n\nHere are some ways to rethink some of the writers you didn't appreciate in high school:\n\n**Jane Austen** is the Lena Dunham of Gentry Era fiction. She's a ruthlessly observational genius filled with radical ideas about women and romance. She's totally brutal, too. A good high school teacher will guide you to see how fucking hilarious Jane Austen is. She's a bitch, and she knows it, and she doesn't care. For example, There's a whole section in Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Bingley attempts to justify his bad handwriting by arguing that he's just really smart and thinks too quickly. Austen writes this dialogue so perfectly, so cunningly that, in the end, her character Elizabeth totally brings Mr. Bingley down to size. We've all met people like Mr. Bingley, is the thing. However, if you don't understand how Austen's humor works, it could come off as simply gentle banter. Furthermore, her legacy is still felt today.\n\n**Joseph Conrad** fathered (or at least perfected) a certain kind of thinking. His works combine intense societal critiques through the power of individual consciousness. Basically, he's one of the original ""the personal is the political"". Even if you don't like *Heart of Darkness*, you're never escaping its impact (which has been followed by many great socialist thinkers btw).\n\n**Mark Twain** basically created American literature. It was mostly very puritan before he came along to satirize the moralization and piety of American literature coming before him. There's no way in hell that some stuffy white men facilitated this. American writers like John Steinbeck, Faulkner, Don Delillo and I'd even argue Bret Easton Ellis have all learned lessons from Mark Twain. His lasting impression isn't because a couple of Harvard deans standing around in a room smoking cigars suddenly decided he's interesting. It's because he's a great writer, and writers after him have either copied him or tried to repurpose his techniques.\n\n **Shakespeare** literally somehow captured and predicted every single literary movement that has happened and probably will ever happen. If you feel a certain way, Shakespeare has written about it. If you don't like Shakespeare, it isn't because you're right. It's because you didn't have a good professor to guide you. I know that may make you feel insecure. How could one dude be so amazing? Well, he was, and you need to deal with it. Shakespeare is the only writer I can say this about with absolute confidence. With the proper introduction, he's one of the most fascinating writers (if not *the* most). But he absolutely needs a guide.\n\nThis goes into the very purpose of literature, which is this: if we want political progress, scientific progress, mathematical progress, we need to know how to redefine our own personal vocabularies. All great writers have, in some way or another, reinvigorated or dismantled the old cliches of their times to document the cultural, intellectual, and psychic changes they observed. Writers give us language we can use to explore our experiences, and reading in terms of a tradition helps us see how languages and conversations develop.\n\nIf you want to dismantle the cliches of conservative America, or SJW liberals, or Orthodox Christians, it helps tremendously to see how geniuses have done so in their own contexts.",5
"question: If jelly was historically preserved for long periods of time and modern food preservation has improved, why do jellies have expiration dates within months of purchase and why do they have to be refrigerated?

Im trying to stick to the ELI5 mentality here, so I guess basically (without getting into the depth and ability that sociopaths experience empathy) , you don't need to really even relate/connect with someone to get them to like you.

"question: In ancient and medieval times, how did soldiers distinguish friend from foe in battle?When I look at movies that have vikings etc in them, they have no regulation uniforms whatsoever and their enemies wear roughly the same looking gear. How did the soldiers know, who were the enemies?  ","answer: Battles used to be quite smaller in medieval times. Smaller units like viking raiders were small enough that everyone knew the face of everyone else on their side. These are people who travel together and live in the same camp together so they would be able to recognize each other, even if they did not remember everyones name. Just remember back to when you went to school with 3-400 other kids and would still be able to recognize people from your school if for example two schools were at the same sports event. This is the scale of most battles. Bigger battles were fought between mostly between different empires. So you would be able to tell people apart based on their gear. A polish knight would have a different style of armor then a french knight.\n\nThere were times throughout history when you would be able to gather enough men from similar regions to have a big battle. But this does require a lot of organization as you need to convince people though money or politics to take part in your war. It is easy to get people to the battlefield when the mongols or the crusades comes and invade your country, however it is much harder to summon people to the battlefield when the neighboring town stole your bucket. When you have an organized wealthy society that can manage such armies you would be able to equip your soldiers with some sort of uniform. Not all soldiers in an army would get the same uniform as they were often belonging to different mercenaries or independent lords. However remembering a few banners is much easier then a few thousand faces. The people under each banner were also kept away from each other for the most part.\n\nBut there are a lot of stories of friendly fires in medieval battles. Soldiers had a hard time recognizing allies in big battles and sometimes mistook their uniforms or banners. One such famous example happened in one of the battles in the war of the roses when a cavalry flanking charge were successful at driving an enemy to panic into opposing infantry forces. But this maneuver send the cavalry charging head on into friendly forces who did not recognize their banners. It was also not that uncommon for soldiers to stop and see if someone they did not know were a friend or foe would attack or not, sometimes even asking them directly. The movie Braveheart uses this as an element a few times and demonstrates how such confusion can happen in the heat of battle and how it can be resolved.","answer: 1) Even though there were no ""standard"" uniforms, armies would often have their soldiers marked with a specific symbol on their clothing, like a big cross or X or something.  You can see an example [in this old painting](_URL_0_).\n\n2) Battles didn't descend into disorderly chaos very frequently.  Armies survive on discipline and cohesion, more than any other factor.  So for the most part, you would stick in a tight group with the rest of your unit, and it would be pretty obvious who was in your unit and who wasn't.\n\n3) Simply yelling.  If a unit got separated, an officer might try to re-group it by yelling for his men to get back into formation.  The average soldier would also be yelling a battle cry, partly to induce fear in the enemy and partly as a unit identifier.  Language and accent would help identify who was who.",4
question: Why Piratebay creator is in prison if it was the users who added illegal content? ,"answer: In 1908, a bunch of countries got together and signed an agreement called ""1908 modification of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works"" (aka Berne Convention) in Berlin.\n\nOne of the topics they discussed was that:\n\n*Hey, its fucking hard to sue individual copyright infringers because there are so many of those bastards and none of them have money! Our important citizens/copyright holders/lobbyers are asking us implement some law that allows them to sue those guys who enables mass infringement and have deep pockets to sue while making it easy for us as we only need to sue one person.*\n\nSo they agreed to say that anyone who *authorises* infringement (secondary infringement) is just as guilty as the people who commits it (aka primary infringement).\n\nBut it was really up to each individual country to adopt that agreement into local domestic legislation with their precise wording. Just because you sign an international agreement, it wont come into effect until you make legislation for it. \n\nTypically, the way most cases have interpreted this vague word is that if they had some combination of the following factors:\n\n* the defendant had technical control to prevent infringement and did nothing about it to prevent it or even turned a blind eye (or even worse, actively promoted it which is what piratebay pretty much did)\n\n* it would have been very easy (ie not a lot of time and money) for the defendant to control/prevent infringement\n\n* they were made aware of the infringing activities\n\n* their business model was reliant on heavy usage of infringing activity (ie legitimate use was minimal compared to illegitimate use) \n\nFor example, a famous case in Australia called iiNet where the ISP was sued for this reason, they satisfied everything except for the fact that they could not easily prevent all those infringing activities.\n\nThe Piratebay creator was probably one of the most easiest cases to find that it was illegal under authorisation out all of the authorisation cases in history. \n\nTaking him to prison is something that the international agreement didnt require each country to do - the addition of criminality must have been added by the jurisdiction he was found guilty for.","answer: Facilitating criminal activity is also a crime. If you help someone commit a crime, even if they could have gotten help from someone else or done it themselves, it's still also a crime.",3
"question: Why is it so taboo to ask about someone's salary?EDIT: Thank you for all your wonderful responses! I'd love to hear if it's taboo in your country (not the US). This is obviously a cultural phenomenon and I wonder if there is an anthropological explanation to this?\n\nEDIT 2: Ok ok, I get it, it's none of my *god damn business*. But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? ","answer: I [just posted this](_URL_7_) over in a thread in /r/tax about how in Norway, all tax returns are public:\n\n >  There's been this reopening of discussion around opening salaries, at least in the developer community where I live. Letting everybody know what you make could be a way of helping everybody make more. It would publicize gaps in pay between men and women, as well as identify inconsistencies in compensation based on education, age, and experience level.\n >  \n >  I really like this. A lot. Except for one thing.\n >  \n >  If people know how much I make, then they may think that they know better than I do how I should spend my money. They could judge me based on how I spend - or don't spend - my money. They would know when I can or cannot afford something. To me, that exposes a critical weakness in ones person.",answer: Because people think that the other judge them only by how much money they gain. And maybe it's true...sometime we think that people with higher salaries are somehow better then people with lower ones.,4
