Wouldn't this have ultimately achieved the same result (bank getting the bailout money) without so many people being foreclosed on?  answer: The government acted as investor for 9 Trillion of the 12.1 Trillion involved in the bailout.

With households, there was no clear opportunity for the government to get their investment back.

Because these are both high-risk, high-return activities.

It's not just ordered by the hospital and passed directly to the patient - further testing is performed to ensure compatibility to the recipient. It's a huge liability to give blood to a patient without prior testing and is heavily discouraged unless it's an emergency situation. My hospital paid around $225 for a regular unit without special requests (CMV status, irradiated, etc). That $225 pays for the person before collection to screen patients, the person to collect the blood, the time to collect the blood, the products used to collect the blood, and the post-collection testing (HIV, hepatitis, etc). Also... a lot of blood just doesn't get used before it expires. It's just the nature of the beast. We do our best to limit this, but a large hospital will still expire 2-3 units on a 'good' day.

So, as you can imagine, non-native English speakers often times failed due to just a simple language barrier. This always infuriated me, my high school was technically a \"failing\" school, but how can accurately assess someone's knowledge if you're not willing to do so in their native tongue? I just don't get.\n\nSo you have that issue on top of all the other issues mentioned in this thread.", "reference": "question: What exactly is wrong with standardized testing in schools?Not that I am a proponent of just endlessly testing students, but it appears to me that, on average, those with the highest test scores are still the ones who are the most intelligent, creative, and dedicated. Top schools take these students, and let me them succeed to their full potential.\n\nObviously there are a few who score low but are still extremely intelligent, but they aren't nearly as common.\n\nWhy do people want to change the system so badly, and to what? answer: As a teacher:\n\n - It's hard to get a rounded view of someone's ability through a test. I've known a lot of students through the years that could get a high mark, yet tell you nothing about the subject a week later. \"Cramming\" doesn't embed the knowledge like using it or arguing about it does.\n\n - All subjects are somewhat subjective. Having an exam board means I have to teach the way they expect. For example I teach IT and I've seen what I'd call image maps called all kinds of things (hot spot, picture link, etc. and yes they all meant the same thing), similarly site maps and other technical terms. \n\n - Because the syllabus for the exam needs to be small enough to be taught, but broad enough to get a sense of the subject you are stuck learning about whatever the guy who make the test thought was important. That limits a teacher's ability to make the subject more interesting by for example going off on a tangent or looking at topics that your students in particular find relevant. And ultimately, if you don't care about something you won't learn it effectively. In some cases you can make something interesting, but it's harder if you don't agree with its importance.\n\n - It encourages teaching exam technique more than anything. I've just run a mock exam and most of the dropped marks are students either not understanding what's being asked or not being able to put their thoughts onto paper. When in real life can you not ask clarifying questions? This again rewards those who can remember the correct words and those with good literacy skills.\n\n - Exams are a completely unrealistic environment. When on earth will you be stuck on your own, with no Internet or phone and not allowed to ask anyone? These days most jobs are about finding and selecting information and being collaborative and creative. Exams focus students on remembering the \"right\" answer rather than thinking about the topic. A wrong thought is often more useful than a right fact if you see what I mean.\n\n - As already touched upon they reward \"middle class\" skills like memory, sitting quietly, neat writing, good literacy. While these are important, they are not the be all and end all to being a useful human being.\n\nHowever you will never get rid of them in the current political system because each party needs to have a number they can see go up and down according to the tale they want to tell. Also, as seen here in the UK with English GCSEs recently, the state can intervene to alter results to make them look worse.\n\nA basic level is needed in literacy and numeracy (and possible IT) that could be tested with a standardised reading/writing/maths test. Beyond that really you need a system like universities where teachers are well trained and trusted to grade professionally. Backed up by a strong inspection and support system to ensure standards."}

{"candidate": "question: Why do zoos prepare animal food as if the animals were at restaurants? why not give the whole uncut vegetable instead of cutting it into pieces? answer: It also ensures that the animal is getting all of the nutrients they need. And, in animals that don't forage, the food is usually placed in a few specific places in the enclosure or on specific platforms that the animals are conditioned to know are used for feeding. That way, the least amount of food goes to waste as possible.\n\nHere's an example: I worked as a camp counselor for two summers at a small zoo near me. Because one of the camp themes was focused on what you need to do to take care of the animals (essentially turning the kids into mini zookeepers for two weeks) and we had to walk through everything we would be doing with the kids, we got to prepare food for and feed the animals.\n\nNow, one of the animals was a polar bear. Instead of throwing chunks of fish and whatever else into it's enclosure where the polar bear may not find them/where they'd rot, we would have to make special meatballs and roll them under a special door in the enclosure where the polar bear was waiting to catch them. These meatballs not only had fish, but also had vitamin and mineral powder mixed in as well as some kelp and a fair amount of fat and meat from some other meat source (I want to say venison or something like that) to ensure that she got as realistic a diet as possible living in captivity.", "reference": "question: Why do zoos prepare animal food as if the animals were at restaurants? why not give the whole uncut vegetable instead of cutting it into pieces? answer: Some reasons,\n\n- Enables all individuals in a group to obtain enough of each food type and reduces aggression.\n\n- Prevents wastage caused by animals taking one bite and discarding the rest of a large item.\n\n- Makes it so that you can scatter the food over a larger area to encourage foraging behaviour.\n\nThere has been some research about if it's a good thing or not since there are some downsides too."}

Agriculture is always the first step a country takes to becoming wealthy. It goes agriculture  >  trade  >  manufacturing. \n\n\nSo you see, the people dying aren't dying because they can't farm.

This cholesterol comes from diet or adipocytes and profound effects roll out from here.

Starters play for a long time and have to face the same batters several times.  As hitters get used to the pitcher (and watch their teammates at bat), they'll start hitting better.  Combined with the pitcher getting tired, at some point they won't be effective any more.\n\nThen relievers come in and usually don't pitch long enough to see the same batter twice, and also know they won't be in the game for long so they can go all-out all the time instead of having to pace themselves.  These factors combined can make it look like a reliever is way better than the starters, but these relievers would mostly not be too good if put in the same kind of situation as a starter.\n\nThe extreme example is the closer, who just comes in when the team has the lead to get the last 3 outs.  Nobody's used to trying to hit him, and he can just burn fastballs because he only has to throw a few.  For as dominant as Mariano Rivera was, if you tried to have him pitch 3 innings he wouldn't have done well."}
{"candidate": "question: Why does a major chord sound happy, while a minor chord sounds sad?Same as many other chords having some emotion attached to it.\n\nIs it PURELY because of how we are used to it in society or is there a biological reason for it? answer: Vi Hart did an excellent video all about this:\n\n_URL_5_", "reference": "question: Why does a major chord sound happy, while a minor chord sounds sad?Same as many other chords having some emotion attached to it.\n\nIs it PURELY because of how we are used to it in society or is there a biological reason for it? answer: Well, hmm.  I am a musician who has spent a lot of time building a personal relationship with harmony.  I think social/cultural conditioning is definitely the first explanation for this.  However, there are many examples of different, unconnected cultures sharing similarities in their folk/traditional music.  This is usually related to the pentatonic scale, that being 5 notes which, in general, don't produce any harsh intervals (spaces between notes, when a chord is played it is defined by the space separating each note). If you are near a piano and don't have any playing experience, try messing around with just the black keys, as they make up a pentatonic scale. \n\nAs explained by other commenters, the relation to the harmonic series, or natural occurrence of overtones in resonant spaces in our world, is important.  The natural series doesn't first make just a pentatonic scale, it is a little bit more, but the pentatonic scale is in there.\n\n[Here](_URL_7_) is a cool video playing the harmonic series to a certain point.  This exists everywhere, and I mean everywhere.  Brass instruments, wind instruments, string instruments (harmonics on a guitar), any tubes, any resonant spaces, a cave even, all have a resonance that follow these steps.\n\nSo, I believe that this natural series is just familiar with everyone, because it is prevalent through everything in our world.  There is always a sense of arriving at \"home\" (the fundamental note, the lowest note, the first note in the scale), or moving away from \"home\".  From that one note, there is a this natural ORDER, all notes can be found in the harmonic series, but the ones that come first are the most \"pleasing\" or \"comfortable\" sounding.\n\nMusicians over the course of thousands of years have built systems to both embrace and take artistic liberty with the sounds found in the world.  Western music has made a system of 12 tones, others include smaller divisions of notes as well, such as South Indian classical music.  We have gone through many changes in what is comfortable to our ears, and what is allowed by the current musical standards.  Bach wrote some of the most beautiful music ever IMHO, but in his time, even the saddest of songs would end on a major chord because, well, thats just how it was.  You didn't end a song on a minor chord, ever.  Please take the time to listen to [this beautiful prelude](_URL_8_) until the very last chord and think about how different that makes you feel than what we would expect (to end on the root minor, \"sad\" chord).\n\nNowadays, we have been accustomed to so many different composers' ways of expressing emotions through harmony in things like movie scores that there definitely is a shared familiarity with tonality/atonality in the general public.  There are undeniable aspects of tension and release that everyone shares, and I believe that this is attributed to the basic relation to the harmonic series in nature.\n\nI'm sure you are all more than familiar enough with tonal music, turn on your radio, these days things are getting more and MORE tonal in popular music, and seemingly have been since the 50s/60s when showtunes and similar music that had been using interesting harmonies became less popular.  Anyways, here are some examples of movie music you may be familiar with and I defy you to tell me they are not pulling some strings within you and providing much tension and release (more tension)\n\n\n[Movie music from psycho](_URL_9_)\n\n[Music from there will be blood](_URL_6_)\n\n\nDamn, it's early, and that was long winded and most likely unclear.

{"candidate": "question: What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm.[removed] answer: MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. \n\nHowever, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (\"extravasate\"). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations.\n\nWhen it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high. A lot of long-time heroin users have scarred up their veins so much that they have to resort to \"skin popping\", which is basically SC or sometimes a more superficial \"intradermal\" injection. This often leads to awful skin and soft tissue infections and abscesses. All those nasty pictures you've seen floating around Reddit of \"krokodil\" users and their horrid necrotizing skin infections are the result of chronic skin popping and IM drug injection.", "reference": "question: What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein?

For that same thing to happen to people born today, population would need to hit 14-16 billion, pretty sure the earth would be destroyed by that number of people on the planet at once.\n\nStory time: I remember when I was a kid, my parents were looking to buy land. They could purchase 65 acres of land 5km from the beach or 50 acres on the beach for around $70,000. Because stainless steel and other corrosion resistant materials were expensive or were unavailable, very few people lived near the beach - they purchased the property away from the beach. The plot of land at the beach they didn't purchase, sold 3 years ago for $60 million.", "reference": "question: Decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house.\n\nWhat's changed in the past decades?\n\n & nbsp;\n\n & nbsp;\n\nEDIT: This is depressing. answer: A fall in union participation rates is what has done it.  Many will argue otherwise but it is the reason we make the same amount of money as we did 40 years ago.  Real wages have been stuck at levels seen in the early 70s.  \n\nThe reason why we don't have so many unions anymore is complex.  Jobs have changed over the decades away from the more niche skilled labor jobs seen in the past that are union-type jobs and now are more diversified.  That is how labor has fallen behind.  We have been split up and separated so we cannot unionize.  Its also easier to replace non-skilled, think technically trained, labor, so if we unionize and strike at fast food establishments, they can find just about anyone to replace the striking workers.  Much harder to replace welders or steel workers.  \n\nThe truth is a bachelor's degree in many subjects does not make you irreplaceable.  Having a unique certification or skill does.  A couple of generations bought into then college degree idea and have homogenized the workforce."}

We were very cash poor (we had a roof over our head, food to eat, and some nice things but no \"spending money\"). Both parents worked but tried to impose many restrictions that just did not work. Even though I would only see them for a few hours each day before going to sleep, it was constant arguing, tension, and disagreements. I needed more freedom than they wanted to allow yet I did more for them than most anyone Ive ever known did at my age. \n\nI had chores that took precedent over all other things once homework/studying was done from about age 7. From the age of 12 I found odd jobs to make a little money for the things I wanted and not only did chores but cooked dinner for the family (mother, father, 2 younger siblings) on a daily basis. Mother would come home after picking up siblings from daycare at about 5pm and dinner was usually done by then. From 16 I had a job as well as got very good grades in school and provided for all of my own needs (food, clothes, laundry, cooking, activities, vehicle, insurance, etc) while playing football for my school and still doing some chores. At 18 I was a full time student at university with a full time job, student loans, no financial support from my parents (they couldnt, not that they didnt want to) and only went home to sleep a few hours before being gone all day again. Even so, each time we were in the house together, there were arguments and disagreements and fights over how I should be doing things differently. Nothing was good enough. \n\nMore and more days would pass at times before I went \"home\" again since I either slept in my car or stayed with a friend. By 20, there was just no point in commuting over an hour each way to \"go home\". A friend of mine and I found a 1 room apt (studio) near school for very cheap and since we were both gone most of the day with varying hours, it worked out very well. \n\nAfter that, there was just no reason to go back to living with my parents and siblings.

I know honey comes from bees, and I know honey is delicious on toast, but what is honey, and does it harm the bees we harvest it from? Can you trace back a batch of honey to the hive it came from, or is all honey the same? answer: Many flowers secrete nectar as part of their biology. They lack the ability to move pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers so they entice bees and insects with nectar with the hope the while the bees collect the nectar they also move the pollen around allowing for the fertilization of the plant species.\n\nHoney bees have a special compartment in their body to hold nectar. This compartment (called the crop or honey stomach) is designed to allow the bee nectar storage while it is foraging. When the forager bee returns to the hive she passes the nectar to a receiver bee who puts it in a wax comb cell for ripening. Nectar has a high moisture content, perhaps 40+%, but the bees want to store the honey for future consumption. They regulate the humidity in the hive via wing flapping over fresh stored nectar and move air in and out from the entrances. Once the honey is at 17/18% moisture content it is ready for capping. The bees cap the cell with wax and that honey will stay in storage until they need it.\n\nIf the season goes well, the colony may collect for example, twice the amount of honey they will need for winter. The beekeeper can take that extra and this harvesting does not harm the bees at all."}

What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling answer: I'm not extremely well informed about this, but Eastern Ukraine is generally more Russian and Western Ukraine more Western-European. SO the conflict starts when the President of Ukraine (from the East) decides to stand in the way of the Europeanization of Ukraine (something about the EU, not sure if they were joining or just trying to take steps to join the EU, but they would be leaving some sort of economic pact with Russia for it). People in the west get pissed because they don't even like Russia, so they rise up and overthrow the Pro-Russian government, but there are still many Pro-Russians in Eastern Ukraine, and so Russia steps in to seize a warm water port that they always wanted, and also to protect the wishes of the Pro-Russian population in Eastern Russia. What is their real motive? Probably the warm water port. But I wouldn't really know, and I doubt many people really do.

{"candidate": "question: Why is the accepted age of sexual relation/marriage so vastly different today than it was in the Middle Ages? Is it about life expectancy?

At least in Medieval England the average age of marriage was actually higher in Medieval England than it was throughout most of the 20th century in America. People get confused because, at least in regards to that period, the noble classes tended to marry young because of the potential political and financial benefits.

What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling answer: The principal geopolitical reason is the freshwater port to the Black Sea, which will allow the Russian Navy to enter the Mediterranean Sea via the Bosporus at Istanbul. This will be Russia\u2019s primary means to access the Atlantic Ocean without having to go through their Arctic and near-Arctic ports. \n\nHowever, Russia also is fearful of waning hegemony, or influence. That\u2019s the heart of this whole thing, the tangible fear of a loss of influence. Much of the Ukraine is very interested in allying itself with the European Union; this was the foundation of the quasi-revolution in Kiev this past month, the decision of the former Prime Minister to ally with Moscow in deference to the EU. So, Russia sends their military into Crimea. This is a very forward, provocative move, but it has precedent in how Russia made moves on Georgia. After all, the other half still identifies itself with Russia. \n\nBoth Georgia and the Ukraine really are on the Eastern Frontier, separating the influence of Russia and Europe. But, since they are so isolated, it's that much easier for Russia to just bully them around without much Western influence other than \u201cstrong words\u201d. \n\nRussia's other major fear is that these states will join NATO. This is popularly portrayed in Russia as a somewhat provocative force that counters their state's efforts to further a better life for its own nation. It also is likely that the West would welcome entrance into NATO for Ukraine should Russia not have intervened as it had. \n\nThe real takeaway is that Russia will further the maintenance of the status quo in the countries around its borders to prevent change, fostering stability. They want to keep their neighbors quiet and in line.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukraine's economy is garbage. They're deep in debt, have been witnessing the expatriation of capital throughout the last month, and interest rates are huge. The initial alignment between Russia and the Ukraine at the beginning of the year was essentially an economic bailout in exchange for alignment. Now, the EU and US are looking to offer monies to the new pro-Western Ukrainian government. \n\nFinally, this all comes down to Putin's government wanting to reengage the West in competition, to portray it as the counter to Russia. This positioning of influences to the Russian people furthers their allegiances to Putin, seeing him as championing their causes for life and prosperity. In essence, this is a bit of scapegoating. (Better, remember that Family Guy where Mayor West makes a big deal out of banning Gay Marriage after making a solid gold statue of cereal mogul Dig'Em of Dig'Em Smacks, then getting in trouble? Same thing, different players. The West is Gay Marriage while Putin's authoritarianistic power siege is Dig'Em. You dig it?)Plus, as the US has moved swiftly from two wars towards quasi-isolationist positioning in very rapid order, there are a lot of countries who\u2019d be open to aligning themselves with a counter-US influence. That\u2019s Russia more than it is China. \n\nThe big geopolitical variable, however, is revolutionary momentum spreading around. Reports are that the Balkans are now beginning to witness calls for change rising up on their allegiances  &  alignments. Imagine if this spreads to other centers along the Russian border, including the Latvian states, Azerbaijan, and even in some of the \u201cStans\u201d. With only passive Western intervention, we could witness spreading demands for Western-style government and economics counter to the Russian offerings. \n\nGoing forward, the West is playing with a weak hand. The EU wants peace; Germany especially, as much of their power comes directly from Russia, and they don\u2019t want their economy to suffer. But, they really want to expand their influence and welcome the Ukraine as a possible member to the EU. Meanwhile, the West appeased Russia before with the de facto appeasement of Georgia. The US\u2019 only qualified engagement since then has been disinterested neglect until the media caught the story. Best the current administration can offer is (1) economic sanctions and (2) putting John Kerry in the country under the belief that Russia wouldn't dare risk the US' Secretary of State being killed in an armed invasion. But, after all these years of general geopolitical neglect, that\u2019s about all the US can do. And because the US acted weak here, Putin figured he can act with impunity. After all, he\u2019s done it before."}

{"candidate": "question: The legal concept of bail. How can a court justify releasing a potentially harmful person for a large sum of cash? answer: It's not supposed to be a large sum of cash. It is supposed to be a refunded inconvenient amount of cash. Eg if a student is arrested for theft, set his bail at $500, so that he shows up for court. He really needs that $500, so he will show up to get it back. A rich person may have bail set at 10k since that would be an inconvenient amount to lose. So in come bail bondsmen, who now operate by default.  Bail bondsmen will pay your bail amount, for a 10% fee. So theoretically, you should now be paying less, though it will not be refunded. However, Courts assume you will use one, so now they set your bail at 10x the amount they would have. For a student on a petty crime, bail will be 5k. The student now has to pay that bail bondsmen $500 to loan that money for a few weeks. This works out great for the bondsmen as a high interest loan.

{"candidate": "question: Why does congress have a 13% approval rate but incumbents are re-elected at a rate of 90%. answer: \"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.\" - Winston Churchill", "reference": "question: Why does congress have a 13% approval rate but incumbents are re-elected at a rate of 90%. answer: I worked on the campaign trail for nearly a decade, so I can tell you the three most interesting reasons:  \n\n1. The Optimism Gap - People hate Congress but love their Congressman.  This is less true than it used to be but the dynamic still holds.  While Congress is less popular than the King of England at the time of the Revolutionary War, most members of Congress get something like 60-70% approval in their home district.  This high level of approval among active voters is primarily due to the gerrymandering of districts (i.e. politicians choose the voters, not the other way around).  However, widespread voter apathy also contributes to this dynamic because most polls only take into account the opinions of people planning on voting (the first question in most polls is:  Are you planning on voting?  No = goodbye).  Therefore, the positive reviews of the politician's active supporters disproportionately skew polling and ignore the potentially negative opinions of inactive voters that exist in the population.  \n\n2. PAC Checks - Most Political Action Committees (PACs) have a rule that they only give money to incumbent members of Congress. It's not just that the guy with the most money wins something like 95% of the time, it's also that most of the money flows to incumbents specifically.  So while the challenger is phone calling every one of their friends for $100 or asking for $25 in an email to build their campaign from scratch and then later spending 5-7 hours/day 5-7 day/week raising money by cold-calling rich donors, politicians already elected to Congress get multiple $5000 checks handed to them at lunches and happy hours in DC.  The incumbents-only rule is especially true of corporate PACs and rarely broken (only when it's obvious the challenger will win).  \n\n3. Franking - In the budget for every member of Congress is an allotment of money for substantial amounts of postage and constituent contact, known as \"franking\".  Essentially, elected member of Congress get to mail their voters for free, telling them how awesome they are and how much amazing legislation they've passed (or stopped).  It's like a low-tech advertising budget for incumbent Congressmen (though some offices have even used franking dollars to run online ads).  This really entrenches incumbents even further because they are constantly corresponding with constituents and doing them favors, which tit-for-tat picks them up additional support at the polls.  Challengers face an uphill battle in gaining similar name recognition and popularity among the population because they have to do it all with their campaign.  Incumbents get to use their office and the campaign to make their case for why they are a good member of Congress who should be re-elected.\n\nWait, this isn't ELI50?  Oops, my bad.  Hope it helps!\n\nPS.  It's really interesting to combine the 13% approval of Congress with the Gallup poll result showing 87% of Americans believe reducing government corruption is extremely or very important (making it a top 3 issue).  I wonder if the 13% of people is the same in both cases - approve of Congress and believe corruption is not a problem.  Who the hell are those people?\n\ntl;dr - Congress sucks, but incumbents got the votes, the money, and the favors."}

Well, those captains are each the basis of a country, and the team are the people in it.\n\nWhen we do well at bat (or...kick...? What do you call the \"batter\" in kickball, anyway?), there is a sense that we all contributed to something bigger than ourselves and our friends will like us more. This makes your team even more separate from the other team, and you want to get along with your team more than you do with the other. So, over time, because you care about doing well and your team doing well, you have spent most of your time paying attention to it and tend to overlook the problems it has. \n\nOn the other hand, the other team is competition, and it's easy to pick out their faults because you want to find them to make sure your team can win. So over time you come to think of your team as better (ignoring its faults) and the other team as inferior (full of faults and nothing else)."}

I want to know everything I would see or hear and how everything would feel. Would there be a rumbling and bright light, with the mushroom cloud above? Would I instantly evaporate?  answer: It would depend on the size of the nuclear weapon. The [nukemap website](_URL_0_) allows you to see how large the blast radius would be for various nuclear payloads.\n\nSo for example if you're talking about a 15 kiloton bomb, such as was used at Hiroshima, then from 15 miles away you'd certainly see the flash, hear the explosion, and see the mushroom cloud, but you'd be unlikely to suffer any physical damage. The biggest threat would come from remaining in the area for several weeks afterwards and so coming into contact with the nuclear fallout (dust, ash, and other debris that is radioactive).\n\nOn the other hand if the largest ever US nuclear bomb (15 megatons) was detonated, then at 15 miles you'd still be within the thermal radiation (= heat) zone. There'd probably be enough power still in the blast pressure to knock you off your feet, and exposed areas of skin would likely be burned. If you'd been looking directly at the explosion you'd almost certainly have been blinded. Unless you leave the area *very* quickly you'll probably receive a fatal dose of radiation from the fallout and will die of radiation sickness in 14-28 days.\n\nThe USSR had plans for bombs of at least up to 100 megatons, the blast pressure from which would have almost certainly instantly killed anyone within about 20 miles of the detonation site.

The papers in that storage room (along with rumors) are the **only** sources we really have on MKULTRA.\n\nThe origins of MKULTRA are largely based on continuation of work of Nazi scientists that came over here during Operation Paperclip. US Navy reports from 1945 included observations of Nazis using mescaline during interrogations at Dachau.\n\nIn 1947, the Navy started their own testing of mescaline, scopolamine and others during Project CHAPTER (1947) which then evolved into Project CHATTER (1951-1953).

If you take objection to it, please substitute it with the phrase \"incentivized with a the threat of a tax penalty.\" \nDo any professionals here know of any similar tax penalties in the face of non-compliance for the other two actors in this system, namely the insurance companies and doctors?\n\n answer: The simple truth is that the insurance industry paid the lawmakers to write it that way, that's how most laws get written."}
{"candidate": "question: VPNs and Proxiesas well as the pros/cons, and whether or not they will be able to facilitate me doing whatever the hell I please online, despite any impending, fascist legislation\n\nedit: I noticed that VPNs had already been addressed earlier...I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol.. answer: > I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol..\n\nA proxy is 'another server' through which you do all of your browsing.  So in a default situation, you are 'directly connected'.  You browse to a website and your ISP's servers handle this for you.  When you hit reddit, reddit can store your IP address or any information against you.  Also your ISP knows that you went to _URL_1_.  Oh and if reddit decides to show you one of those adverts, you'll see a \"meet hot girls in  < yourarea >  tonight!\"\n\nWhen you introduce a proxy, it forwards the request for you.  You are telling the proxy 'I want _URL_1_' and the proxy server goes out, gets it for you and sends it back.  That makes a big difference.  That means that if you browse to reddit using a proxy, reddit sees the proxy's IP address.  If it does an IP-address-to-geographical-location-lookup, it will think you are wherever the proxy server is, rather than your actual location, so it might say \"meet girls in [low earth orbit](_URL_0_) tonight!\".  There are of course many different types of proxies, and some proxies will forward your IP address to the server, others will hide it for you and anonymize you as much as possible.  \n\nExample usage: the front page of reddit almost always has some Colbert video clip which everyone is celebrating together and you are left out because you are a pitiful foreigner.  Well, you could go through a proxy based in the US.  Because Colbert's website sees the proxy's IP address, it may think you are in the US and let you watch the video.\n\nOther examples, suppose you want to visit a website which you are not comfortable leaving your 'information' on.  Think torrent sites.  You went to a torrent site and downloaded a car.  A few days later, authorities seize their servers and your IP address is on their web server logs.  They can find you then.  So what some people do is they browse the torrent site through a proxy and download a car.  When the servers are seized, all the authorities see are the proxy's IP address.  Whether or not they can get YOUR IP address from that proxy server depends on the proxy server owner.  The owner may choose to not store any info about you at all and the owner may choose to store the info.", "reference": "question: VPNs and Proxiesas well as the pros/cons, and whether or not they will be able to facilitate me doing whatever the hell I please online, despite any impending, fascist legislation\n\nedit: I noticed that VPNs had already been addressed earlier...I still would like to know what a proxy is/how to get one/what's so great about being behind 7 of them lol.. answer: Think of your Internet service provider like a concerned parent. They may be strict or they may not care what you do unless you draw a lot of attention to yourself. Either way they tend to try and keep an eye on what you are doing and listen out for trouble when you are within earshot but out of sight. \n\nWhen you play outside or up in your room you call out to your brother asking him to do stuff that is part of the game you are playing. Your parents hear this and will notice if you ask him to do something naughty that they would not like. \n\nA VPN is like having two foreign exchange students staying in the house for the summer. Now you can whisper to one German kid what you want and he can shout that in German to the other German kid who then speaks or shouts the English version to your brother. \n\nYour parents know something is being shouted back and forth between you and your brother but since they don't speak German they don't have a clue what is being said. They know what the second German kid is saying because he uses English but they don't know if he is speaking for you or for some other kid because lots of kids use the German kids this way. \n\nThe best German kids to use for this would be German kids with a short term memory problem. After a few minutes they forget what they were told and who said it to them. Now even if the parents ask the German kids what was going on and who was involved they honestly don't know. \n\nSome kids who are doing nothing naughty at all might choose to do this thing with the German kids just for the sake of having privacy or to make it harder for the parents to figure out which other kids are being naughty. \n\nNow, other people in the neighborhood listening in only hear the German kid shouting and have no clue who is whispering in his ear because if you recall he provides this service to lots of different kids. If a house gets toilet papered the only thing that the neighbor who owns that house can do is ask the German kid questions or ask all local parents if their kids were the ones who planned the prank. \n\nIf the German kid has a memory loss and your parents only heard German which they don't understand then no one can point the finger at you. Your parents know you said something and for how long you spoke but not what was said. \n\nIn the above example the two German kids are the encrypted tunnel and the second German kid is the proxy. To the world at large the second German kid is the one asking questions or giving instructions but he is really a \"proxy\", simply relaying what you want. The short term memory problem is similar to VPN servers that don't keep log files. The German language is the encryption used to cover your tracks."}

As a driver, you not only have a chance of being harmed, but you also pose a risk of harming others. The minimum required insurance is to help the other party should you injure them. Health insurance is only to protect you.

{"candidate": "question: What does this ISP selling browser history mean for me?[removed] answer: Just going to Copy-Paste from another thread I replied to:\n\nOk, I do netsec  &  net eng so without going into super specifics let's give this a whirl:\n\n > but is it now also possible Google to sell my browsing data\n\nIt always was, and they do. Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves. That is where their money comes from.\n\nThe thing is google doesn't have all your browsing data. Google has your search history, any tracking done through their ad services, your email, your location if you use google maps, and basically anything you do on chrome or stock android, especially if you are signed in.\n\nNow google themselves uses this information to provide a very good service. Ever wonder why google searches tend to be the best? Well not only are they the biggest, but because of their user profile, they know what you want.\n\nTake a member of /r/the_donald and /r/politics. Have those two users both search the word \"impeach\" and they will get two different suggestion lists. While both will likely have \"Impeach Obama\" and \"Impeach Trump\" they will likely be in different order.\n\nThis is because google is predicting what you want based on previous search history  &  email keywords (yes google scans your email).\n\nNow google provides **excellent** service, but there is a price to pay for it. On the internet if you are not paying for something you can assume you are the product being sold.\n\nUnless of course google is your ISP. Then they get everything, because they can see everything.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nOnto what *YOU* can do about it. Get yourself a VPN (Virtual private Network).\n\nThere are many providers, I myself use NORDVPN, but they aren't the most popular due to some customer service issues, and they aren't the most secure if you aren't running on openVPN. The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.\n\nBut if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.\n\nOn to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?\n\nA VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel  &  routes all your internet traffic through that.\n\nSo instead of seeing:\n\n* workacct1484 connects to _URL_1_ \n* workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad\n* workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from  < nodes > \n\nmy ISP instead sees:\n\n* workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to  < Server > \n* workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to  < Server > \n\nSo my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they *could* sell my browsing data, it would be useless.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_0_)\n\nNow you might say to yourself, \"Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue  &  subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?\"\n\nYes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:\n\n* MPAA sues  &  demands VPN logs\n* VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.\n* MPAA curses\n\nNow if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.\n\nHow do we get around this? TOR:\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nTOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.\n\nWhat does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well you don't connect to _URL_1_. do a traceroute to even _URL_2_  &  you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.\n\n[Diagram](_URL_3_)\n\nThis does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first  &  last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is **NOT** easy, but it *CAN* be done.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSo if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.\n\nSecond get a VPN.\n\nThird use TOR over that VPN.\n\nFourth, start calling your representatives  &  telling them how you feel, then GET OUT  &  VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.\n\nFinally, realize you lack the money  &  expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nAnd finally what does this mean for you?\n\nFor the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. \n\n#GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.\n\nThey are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.\n\nBut why should you care?\n\nBecause these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data  &  sees you looking for a new job  &  fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history  &  sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to  < Local Credit Union > .com and now can focus their attack.\n\nIf you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in \"private\" browsing modes.\n\nAnd because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not \"free\" and there are no realistic competitive options.\n\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.", "reference": "question: What does this ISP selling browser history mean for me?[removed] answer: Some helpful software.\n\nFirefox: DuckDuckGo (!g); and Onion browser\n\nAddons: Ublock Origin, NoScript, Disconnect, and self destructing cookies\n\nPlease obtain a VPN!

Normally in the winter the air is much dryer (notice how much more static electricity is on freshly dried clothes in the winter as oppose to the summer?). Anyways, the more relative humidity there is the hotter the air feels to you because it cannot accept as much perspiration. Similar to how people say places like Vegas and Phoenix had \"dry heat\" a \"dry cold\" will feel much cooler than a cold temperature with higher humidity. Also, if you look at psychometric charts you'll notice that cold air is naturally less humid.

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? answer: The idea that you don't talk about Money is a very, very old idea.  It predates the US.  I don't know if it originated in England, or if its even older, but it been around a while.  \n\nYou might have heard of a [Window Tax](_URL_0_).  This was implemented in both England and France a few hundred years ago as a form of an income tax.  The idea being that the more windows a person had in their house, the more income they had an the more taxes they could pay.  Why not just have an income tax?  Well, people didn't talk about money, and that included telling the gov't what you made (or the gov't asking).  \n\nSo, how did this \"don't talk about money\" come about?  Well, I'm not totally sure.  One thing you need to consider is that historically, class was not about money.  Today we think of a rich class, and a poor class.  But, in England and France, a Poor noble man was of higher \"Class\" than merchant with a thousand times more money.  Those who worked for money, doctors, lawyers, and merchants were of the middle class.  The upper class DID NOT WORK.    \n\nSo, the idea that you didn't talk about money may have been about hiding the elephant in the room when the upper class got together.  A Baron wouldn't want to insult a Duke by discussing how much more money he had, when the Duke was his social better.  \n\nBut, in the US, we don't have the same concept of class. But, in general, the idea of not talking about money still comes into play.  I say in general because different groups feel differently.  Old money families from New England or the South are going to be the most closeted.  Money is discussed more freely in other areas of the country, and in middle class and poor families.  \n\nBut, that still doesn't answer why.  As to why, I'm going to make a guess.  Kinda like when talking about religion, it's really easy to insult someone.  It's a very emotional topic.  Some people feel embarrassed they don't have enough.  Others feel embarrassed that they have too much.  When people do talk about money, epically with regards to how much THEY make, it's easy to assume they are bragging or complaining.  Neither of which are very couth.  \n\nEven when discussing things discretely, it can cause problems.  Things got temporary uncomfortable between me and a friend when he found out how much money I made.  He thought we made about the same amount ... we didn't.  So, better to keep a lid on it."}

This is where a person's salary is not correctly matched to their contribution.  If salaries were published, then these errors would be revealed and morale would suffer, and that would be bad for the organization.  Publishing salaries would lead to swifter fixes for the errors, and that would be good for the company.  There is not universal agreement on each employee's level of contribution, so the perception of salary error is inescapable when salaries are published.\n\nCompanies promote the salary taboo to avoid the negative consequences of publishing salary errors, real or perceived.\n\nEmployees might benefit from salary publishing, for example, by creating a more efficient job market.  But, many individuals benefit from hiding their own salary.  For example, hiding salary might help individuals with lower than average salary by making them appear more successful than they are.  Hiding salary might help individuals with higher than average salary by making it easier for them to fit in with others.\n\nSo, both the individuals and the companies that pay them have a shared interest in keeping salaries secret.  That makes asking about it taboo."}
{"candidate": "question: Why do so many European countries show hatred towards the European Union (like the UK), even though it has lead to the most peaceful and stable period in European history?[removed] answer: One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU.\n\nCountries in the EU have to let people from other EU countries live and work there with no restrictions. This has resulted in a large number of people coming from less wealthy countries such as Poland coming to live in the wealthier ones including the UK.\n\nSome people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. Although this is statistically not true in the average case.\n\nOther people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment. However now many British businesses and organisations are likely to face a shortage of workers.\n\nAnd finally some people don't like how society has changed due to immigration. There are many more non-English speakers than there used to be, and there are lots of shops around catering to various immigrant groups. This makes some people feel like it's \"not their country any more\".", "reference": "question: Why do so many European countries show hatred towards the European Union (like the UK), even though it has lead to the most peaceful and stable period in European history?[removed] answer: One of the reasons is that EU tries to make EU as an united nation.

EU should not have an authority over the laws of any nation.\n\n\n\nThen many people does not like Euro at all, since it actually has hurt the economy of smaller countries than actually helped them."}

What about plugging in a clothes dryer? Here in the USA we have \"split service\". 120/240vac. 2 legs come into the house from the same phase at 120 v leg to ground. Leg to leg however is 240v. We plug our toaster into 120v but our clothes dryer (and other things) into 240v. As to why, the other examples given make sense... lightbulb, tesla, and such. But I will say with 120v being less pressure, while higher gauge wire is required in the home it is nicer to be shocked by 120v instead of 240v. Not to mention our wire sizes for home are 14, 12, 10, and I forget for the clothes dryer but I think that's like 2. As far as the grid goes, that's usually 2 aut, 3 strand from the transformer to the house.

{"candidate": "question: if the aim of the prison system is to reintegrate felons into society why are they branded for life in such a way that it makes it nearly impossible to get a job?[removed] answer: Much of it has to do with how the government believes society should deal with crime. If you believe people are at their core natures shitty, then those people can't be rehabilitated in order to save them from themselves. The only hope is that you provide enough a deterrent with dire consequences to prevent them from doing crime, as bad people only respect power.  Thomas Hobbes basically put this idea forward in *The Leviathan.*\n\nIf you believe people are innocent and angelic at birth, as Jean Jeaque Rosseau did, and that society corrupts them, then society should deal with crime through rehabilitation.  For what person would continue trying to make their rights wrong when everything around them continually reminds them of their mistakes and refuses to let them move on?  A primarily penalizing society would rob a good person of any hope of redemption, and he or she would fall back into despair and regret, giving up on doing the right thing.\n\nI myself believe Hobbes leans more toward the truth, but people don't have to be angels in order not to be devils. They can be uneducated, misguided, and dare I say, innocent or ignorant, and living in a free society gives them the opportunity to better themselves and \"move towards the light,\" so to speak.\n\nPlus the prisons want to make a profit.", "reference": "question: if the aim of the prison system is to reintegrate felons into society why are they branded for life in such a way that it makes it nearly impossible to get a job?[removed] answer: Consider that in business, you ideally want your customers to come back again and again.

{"candidate": "question: Why is the accepted age of sexual relation/marriage so vastly different today than it was in the Middle Ages? Is it about life expectancy? What causes this societal shift? answer: 3 things: infant mortality, death in childbirth, and lack of a safety net.\n\nBefore a safety net, your children were your Medicare and Social Security. If you didn't have kids, you weren't going to have someone to care for you when you got too old to work. That was a huge problem, so people tried to maximize their chances of children who would outlive them.\n\nThis brings us to the other two points. Infant and child mortality used to be really high. In Ancient Rome, there was about a 50/50 chance of a kid living past their 10th birthday. So, if you wanted to have kids who survived into adulthood, you'd need to have a lot of children to ensure that some would survive. As a result, women needed to start having children as soon as they were fertile to maximize the chances. But, lots of women died in childbirth, meaning it was even more important to have kids as early as possible, so that the man could remarry and have more kids who would be able to survive and care for him in his old age.", "reference": "question: Why is the accepted age of sexual relation/marriage so vastly different today than it was in the Middle Ages? Is it about life expectancy? What causes this societal shift? answer: In the west it hasn't really changed that much between the middle ages and about the 1960s. After that, the age at which people got married slowly went up because women were expected to be \"established\" in a similar way to men to have a stable home life which took time. Otherwise, women usually got married late teens/early twenties and men a bit after that, because men had to establish careers and whatnot.\n\nWomen got married younger than that occasionally but there was usually a reason why. Marriages between powerful families would be arranged at a young age because marriages helped cement political alliances, so daughters would get married off ASAP if it would be politically advantageous. Other reasons would be extenuating circumstances, like a girl getting pregnant (even if she's 14, she can't have children out of wedlock). The first reason is probably why we think people got married much younger -- royalty and the like are written about much more than common people."}

From those views, I've made around $12,000 to $15,000 in total.\n\nThere are two ways I make money:\n\n1. Ads. Everybody claims they make 1-2$/1000 views. This isn't accurate for most people. The average is 0.80$/1000 views.\n\n2. Licensing. This is when companies license a video you created. They will usually pay a lump sum of 100-250$ USD for video rights.\n\nOther ways:\n\n3. Product Placement. Simple enough. A company will pay a YouTuber to show a product in their video. Ex: Pepsi could pay PewDiePie $20K to drink a Pepsi in his video. \n\n4. Merchandise Store. If you're large enough that you have dedicated fans, these fans will buy your merch.", "reference": "question: How do popular YouTubers make money?[removed] answer: I once thought about really becoming a youtuber.

{"candidate": "question: Anti-aliasing answer: Try taking some basic LEGO\u00ae bricks (let's use some black 2x2 blocks  for our example, part #3003) and try to make a diagonal line with them. You'll find the best you can do looks like a staircase with zigzaggy corners.\n\nNow step back and squint a bit so your vision is blurry. The further you are, the less you notice the pointy corners. If you were to do the same thing with DUPLO\u00ae bricks of the same 2x2 size and color (part #3437), you'de find a similar effect, but you'de have to be much farther away to make it look less zigzaggy.\n\nSo how can we get rid of the zigzaggyness? One way, as we saw, is to use smaller bricks (pixels), which allow us to be closer. But there's also another trick you can use. Going back to your original smaller bricks (which are black, on your conviniently white table), start placing grey bricks so that they touch a black brick on two sides. You'll notice the line is bigger, but if you step back and squint, it'll look even less zigzaggy than before. That's because the grey is the color in between the line and the background, which means they blend together better when we look at them. This is a type of antialiasing.", "reference": "question: Anti-aliasing answer: Aliasing happens when you try to describe something that changes rapidly, and you can't describe it fast enough. For example, imagine you're measuring a half a meter deep hole, and your measuring stick is only capable of measuring in full meters. Whatever measurement you leave with, you've lost information of the real size; you're left with an approximation. \n\nThe same thing happens in sound. Say you want to measure a 10Hz wave (moves up and down ten times a second), but you are only capable of measuring it five times a second. You'll never get an accurate representation of the true shape of the wave, and anything you come out with is distorted. This is aliasing. The more samples you make, the closer you get to a real representation what the shape truly is.\n\nA guy called Nyquist proved that in order to sample a frequency, we need to sample at at least twice the rate. \n\nSo, anti aliasing is a way of getting around these fundamental issues in what happens when we lose information in our signals. With pixels for example, the square edges introduce such a harsh transition that we lose information of what goes on between the pixels. An interesting way of reducing this effect includes sub pixel anti aliasing, where you take advantage of the fact that each pixel is comprised of a discrete R, G, B value, smaller than the pixel itself and therefore capable of generating higher 'spatial' frequencies. It has been proven that you can share these colour components with neighbours to try and spoof the missing information, producing what appears to be a much higher quality image."}

{"candidate": "question: how do most flamboyant gay guys sound so different then straight guys? Do they train themselves to sound like that? answer: Male monozygotic (identical/single egg) twin here. My twin brother and I are the same height, weight, shoe size, and we share the same contact lens prescription. He is hetero and I am gay. We grew up in the same household and without any traumatic events, so should be a pretty good case study. We're both turning 29 this year.\n\nThe affect/dialect, along with the mannerisms, are both a nature and nurture development:\n-visual gender role modelling is a critical factor, if not the \"trigger\" factor\n-a chemical or biological change occurs pre-10 that strengthens/supplements the initial gender role modelling\n-there is most definitely a biological point of no return sometime pre-puberty\n\nThis would account for the difference in the pitch of my brother and my voice despite our diaphragms, chests, ribs, etc sharing the same measurements. \nNotes: \n-My brother role modeled our father, I did not\n-Neither of us exhibits a gay dialect, as this as unlearned/compensated for at a young age on my part, but I definitely noticed the beginnings of both a gay affect and manner in myself at around 13 \n\nA developed gay man does not adopt the affect or mannerisms for social reasons. Pre-10 gay male children are a great example of this, as they frequently exhibit the affect and mannerisms before learning social awareness.\n\nBut maybe the most important argument I can make here is that if you're a gay male who speaks and acts outwardly like a hetero male, a conscious effort is being made to reduce the manner/dialect. You can imagine it like drinking too much caffeine. That feeling of being \"wired\" is similar to the lack of control a gay male has over their affect or mannerisms. Any corrective behaviour is usually learned through visual role modelling of masculine figures, which is why it's not uncommon to see a gay male overcorrecting with hypermasculine voice and body language. After dating many gay men from both the Vancouver and Seattle areas, I can tell you that not one of them was without a slight gay affect in their most relaxed environment, and most of them claim initially to be straight acting - the only difference is self awareness.", "reference": "question: how do most flamboyant gay guys sound so different then straight guys?

The smaller particles of ash makes the pores in the concrete (tiny spaces between particles) very small. This prevents water from soaking into the concrete, which breaks it down and erodes it. \n\nConcrete takes a short time to set, but a long time to cure.

The more it makes zero logical sense.\n\nPlease explain.\n answer: As a trans person this is my understanding to it all. I will also mention some other things people don't really get. I did research and read a lot of reports before and during my transition. I believe the current understanding is we have brain traits that resemble the gender we later identify as, maybe not completely but enough to cause some sort of dysphoria. This happens in early development cause of a hormonal imbalance in the womb or in the first few years of life. I think a few other posts on here explain this a bit better. Also once you start hormones they change your brain even more. \n\nIf this helps anyone understand transgender people some more, this is my experience. \n\nI didnt experience dysphoria as a child as gender related things did not matter. I do have clear memories of feeling something wasnt right but I was too young to understand what. \n\nIt wasn't until I started to hit puberty that the depression and dysphoria hit with a real disconnection from what I saw in the mirror. At this stage it was like I know that is me and this is what I look like, however this is not what I should be like and being a man is something I do not want to be. As time went on I hated everything about myself cause it felt wrong on a fundamental level. You do feel like a fake, freak or just plain different from everyone else. Yet at the same time all anyone sees or regards you by is everything you hate about yourself. \n\nNow I mention this cause of two reasons. Firstly cause people dont get why we do it, why we take hormones and alter ourselves. They may see it like a curable illness like depression or an eating disorder.\n\n I have tried to treat my depression hoping that it would cure my dysphoria but it never went away, even on meds with therapy. I tried to work on changing my outlook and making my relationship with my male body more positive but the gut feelings of self hatred and dysphoria never went away. \n\nThat was until I started taking hormones. After a few months on hormones the years of depression started to subside and I was starting to feel human. It is a far quicker, cheaper and easier solution to dealing with gender dysphoria. Plus makes us feel happier and allows us to live a fulfilling life. \n\nNow that brings me to the second reason I mentioned my experience. People say that it doesnt work and often point the rates of suicide after the surgery or whatever. \n\nI can only speak from my experience but I am glad I transitioned, I feel a lot more home in my skin than I did before. However I have lost friends, family and my job because of it. I dont pass all the time and I do still get the remarks and the laughing sometimes. I currently have no/little skills to help me get another job cause of the years of depression. With not passing I cannot get past the interview.  \n\n It is because of these reasons I am currently depressed and consider suicide. NOT because of my own gender issues but the way I am treated. So as a trans person I have went to feeling depressed and suicidal because of my body to feeling the same way because society cant accept my decision to try to be happy.\n\nOne final point to something that really bugs me. I know my genetics dont change. Every trans person knows what they are in a purely scientific view point. We are not deluded and know full well what our decision is and what it will cost.

Sorry if its got any errors or anything.", "reference": "question: How are transgender individuals different from other dissociative identity disorders?I need your help on this one Reddit. \n\nI really can't quite process the whole gender identity thing.\n\nA common idea that we constantly tell people is to \"just be yourself\"\n\nHowever transgender individuals take drugs (hormones), have surgical procedures to actually alter themselves. \n\nThis really doesn't make any sense from an acceptance stand point, because aren't they not actually accepting themselves?\n\nIt really is confusing to me and doesn't seem different from any of the other dissociative identity disorders like multiple personality disorder.\n\nOr even that of eating disorders where individuals physically alter themselves (through starvation/purging) to achieve a perceived self image?\n\nThe more I think about it.  The more it makes zero logical sense.\n\nPlease explain.\n answer: There are quite a few people who have already responded with really nice scientific and personal insights, but if anyone is still on the fence and wants an anecdotal but direct comparison I'll throw it in here.\nI'm mtf trans with a girlfriend of 5+ years who was diagnosed with severe borderline disorder, and is constantly being told she's also DID/not depending on who the psych evaluating is (yay public health system). I'm also a recovering anorexic, so I feel like I can adress your other question as well.\n\nTo start with, I'd say there are lots of ways in which all 3 of these things - being trans, borderline/DID, and anorexic - are similar. That is that if you were to just tell someone to get over it, and accept themselves without treatment, you're probably not going to see them around again very much longer.\nIf you told my girlfriend to just \"accept herself\", she'd most likely end up either killing herself, me, or causing massive damage during a downswing or when one of her aggressive personalities surfaces. \nLikewise, from the time I hit puberty until 20, I was told to accept myself, and attempted suicide 3 times because I felt like I couldn't be who I really was while forced to live in the body I had. \nI think that seems to be something a lot of people have trouble understanding, is just how difficult it is to hear \"be yourself\" while you literally cannot embody yourself. When someone is told \"Oh, this person has bipolar disorder.\", or \"This person has manic depression\", the stigma is still there, but it seems like people think it's perfectly reasonable to treat those symptoms with pharmaceuticals and therapy, yet not so of gender dysphoria?\n\nI had resorted to pretending my body didn't exist, nearly starving myself to death multiple times to make it as small and underdeveloped as possible, in order to make it easier to close my eyes and just think of myself as just a brain and a soul. So when people told me to just accept my body, this is where I'd run to, in order to stay sane. \n\nNow, I'm not saying that everyone feels dysphoria that strongly, but I hope it gives a clear background about what my experience is. Based on that, I'd say that HRT is completely in line with \"being yourself\". My girlfriend takes mood stabilizers in an attempt to be true to who she sees herself as 90% of the time, and relies on outside help for that other 10% where she cannot be herself (as she identifies with her dominant personality, that's deeper into DID than I plan on going into here). \nI take HRT to feel embodied and true to myself (and others) 90% of the time, and plan to have surgery for that 10% where I need social confirmation from either my girlfriend or others that my body actually exists the way I think it does."}

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? answer: We had a guy in our circle who was a great friend. You could tell he was a little uncomfortable about talking about what he did for a living when pressed. We all bitched about our jobs to each other.  He always had time to help people move, build something, or hang out... We began to wonder how he had so much time and lived so comfortably.  At some point someone found out he doesn't work at all and what he said he did for a living was more like a hobby. The guy was a multimillionaire somehow because of his wife's money.  They both lived very comfortably off of investment income in an aging town with a poor standard of living.\n\nIt changed everything between us all. A lot of the guys straight up started asking for cash, leveraging their friendship. There was often jokes about him being a bum with all the luck in the world, \"must be nice\" became a motto.\n\nEventually the entire families of everyone found out, including children. This meant everyone everywhere knew, including his neighbors. One of his neighbors sued him after slipping on his sidewalk while walking his dog and got some kind of ridiculous payout.  There was some controversy in the community about it because the sidewalk was shoveled, was salted a few hours earlier and it was snowing still. The neighbor pressed hard and fast. Quietly some of the guys rooted against our friend and started making judgments on how he was lazy and it was his fault.\n\nCouple of the guys really resented him and it got a little toxic with personal insults directly relating to money and what we were all doing with our lives vs this guy sitting on his ass with a sugar momma.\n\nHe moved and built his dream home somewhere and hasn't kept up with any of us as far as I know, and I say good for him. He didn't deserve that and we proved we didn't deserve him. Couple of the guys still scoff at the mention of his name, I doubt they know truly why they do this. \n\nI recently began making a lot more money, and I keep a tight lid about it. I even found myself pretending like I'm struggling a little just to throw the dogs off. In all honesty though, I've tried to slowly move away from them but it ain't easy to just scoop up new friends at an older age, at least not for me."}

{"candidate": "question: Does passing out have any advantages?Passing out from an uncomfortable experience, heat exhaustion or pain seems to have no advantage. Is there any benefit? answer: Passing out protects your body from excessive stress or injury. If you are forced to continue (in action movies or sci fi they sometimes have people who allegedly can't feel pain or can run at top speed forever) cells would run out of energy and joints can get injured.\n\nSometimes it's a system shut down. A punch or blow that causes your brain to hit the side of the skull (usually your brain is floating in a liquid which protects it from concussions) which can overwhelm it and cause it to shut down (like rebooting your PC but not exactly)\n\nAnother could be an interruption of how your biology needs to function. Think about a sleeper hold. Your brain needs a constant supply of blood to stay functional. Squeezing the carotid arteries cuts blood from the brain and it shuts down.

So while it may be true that it is $1 worth of medicine, that ignores millions of dollars that went into the development that need to be recouped to turn a profit on the drug. The company gets a patent on the drug for a time that helps with that, but when it becomes generic the price will drop a good bit. \n\nGovernment intervention of various types could bring prices down, but too much intervention could end up disincentivizing R & D.", "reference": "question: How are prescription drug makes able to sell drugs at such absurd markups, and is there anything consumers can do to change it?[removed] answer: The root of this is supply and demand, particularly enhanced by lack of competition.\n\nDemand for medication is very high. It's being purchased because it's needed, or because it's required to have on hand. Supply is very limited, because just one entity is allowed to make it, because they funded or bought the research that established certain intellectual property: the \"recipe\" for that medication.\n\nIn that scenario, the market will still buy the product as the price gets higher. So, the company produces and sells the amount that they can produce and sell at the best rate of return on their investment (and what they can afford to produce with available capital).\n\nThis is single bottom line mentality.  Other concepts, such as Triple Bottom Line (\"people, planet, profits\"), seek to not always maximize profit if they can trade it for worthwhile progress on their \"people\" and \"planet\" metrics. I wouldn't say that the consumer can always choose a triple bottom line company to buy medication from (although if it is available, it might be worth extra money to you, or at least you could choose it).  I suppose the least you could do is to demand legislation (and support it when it arrives by writing lawmakers or testifying for it) that opens the market up to competition by breaking down intellectual property barriers so that more than one entity can produce a medication.  Just be aware that as the profits in the pharmaceutical research industry fall, the money available to do that pharmaceudical research is also impacted.  Think if it this way: with low market competition, they will try to make it as expensive as possible.  With high market competition, they will try to make it as *cheap* as possible, with everything that goes along with \"cheap\"."}

I had a friend recently take his life. I knew this person for 20 years and for about 10 of those years he was depressed and had anxiety issues. He came from a  poor family and due to his mental issues he had no personal relationships or upper level connections for education or career paths.  \n\nHe left a note outlining his reasoning for taking his own life and I completely understood why he did it. He tried every medication and therapy technique to attempt to resolve his issues. After 10 years of getting nowhere, he honestly had no other logical decision.  He used a quick and painless method at the end. He scheduled an email to the local authorities and wore a tux so he would look decent when he was retrieved. When he did it, I had a deep sigh of relief because I knew he was in a better state. \n\nI think a law should be introduced which allows a person to either take their own life or allow doctors to anonymously assist the person by providing necessary medicine for a painless and quick death.  The criteria should contain items from the following:\n\n* Proof of a diagnosis of a mental condition from a certified professional\n* Documents which show the person's mental condition having negative effect on the person's life. This can include a poor work history, poor financial management, bad credit score, poor grades, etc.\n* Notarized signature of at least one immediate relative\n* No legal issues (Active court cases, alimony, active warrants, etc)\n* Enough money to cover any costs associated with the voluntary death and the processing afterwards or insurance which would cover it\n\nIf I were in a situation where my mental state would not allow me to be successful or happy after years of medication and therapy, instead of burdening my family or tax payers for medical bills, I would rather just end it and be happy.  I would rather see the tax payer money saved put into scholarships to reduce the cost of education for those who will be successful.\n\nYou could argue that someone in enough physical pain could not be in the right state of mind to end their life with a terminal illness."}
{"candidate": "question: How and why are books like The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men chosen for reading in English classes? answer: I'm probably too late for this shindig, but there's an important component I see many people missing, and this is, in my view, the most important reason we read books like Huck Finn, The Great Gatsby, and Pride and Prejudice.\n\nYes, part of the answer here is the 'canon', i.e. there's a (possibly arbitrary) group of central texts chosen by old white dudes with Oedipus complexes. Look at other comments for answers about the canon.\n\nNow, I have a problem with the 'canon' answer because it's overly simplified, and is often used as a false comfort. 'The Canon' is the answer people want to hear if they don't understand why they're being made to read *The Great Gatsby*. That is, if you're just bored by *The Great Gatsby*, it's comforting to say, \"Well, some boring old white dudes arbitrarily decided I should read this when really it's just boring drivel that has no relevance to modern life and that's Fitzgerald's fault, not mine, let's move on to Harry Potter. Fuck the canon, it's racist.\" (The canon is, indeed, pretty racist, but let's move on)\n\n**Something I don't see people talking about, however, is literary tradition, which I see as the more significant reason to read writers like Fitzgerald and Steinbeck.**\n\nTo explain: writers read each other. Whom writers read and whom writers like will impact their own work. Toni Morrison's *Beloved* is illuminated if, afterwards, you read Faulkner. Morrison wrote a Ph.D. on Faulkner for cryin' out loud. That doesn't mean you can't read *Beloved* without *As I Lay Dying*; it simply means Beloved will be a different, and more interesting book if you do. You can't fully appreciate J.G. Ballard unless you also understand Joseph Conrad. J.G. Ballard is basically using the exact same metaphors as Conrad, just updated and less racist. He's admitted as such. If you read Virginia Woolf before you read Ursula K. Le Guin, you'll be amazed by the connections you'll make. The texts dance with each other. It doesn't matter that Le Guin writes Science Fiction and Woolf writes in the mode of Modernism--Le Guin has been heavily influenced by Woolf, and reading the two together is very enlightening.\n\nAnd then come the two giants of them all: Shakespeare and The Bible. Look, you can read literature without having read any Shakespeare or any of the Bible, but that doesn't mean you'll be erasing the ginormous impact these works have had on literature. In the most fundamental ways, the language of The Bible has seeped into the entire umbrella of English literature. Even if you don't know it as a writer, you're either adopting the ways The Bible uses words, or rebelling against it. No matter what, you're always responding to it. It doesn't even need to be purposeful on your part.\n\nSo, yes, there's an aspect of 'the canon', but the canon wasn't just chosen by stuffy old white men. It was also chosen by writers, and a writer worth their salt will have read from the canon, and will know what interests them, and what they think is missing. To track this progression can give us insight into the way dialogues in our culture develop. It isn't arbitrary that Toni Morrison is following in Faulkner's footsteps, and it certainly isn't because some old white dudes told her to and that was that.\n\nPart of the issue is that high school students don't necessarily have the perspective available to approach some of these texts, and it's often in high school where these texts are read. For example, what does an expedition down the misty Congo river have to offer to someone going into engineering, or politics, or environmental science? I think the reason a book like Conrad's *Heart of Darkness* evades us is because books like it are often taught in the wrong way.\n\nHere are some ways to rethink some of the writers you didn't appreciate in high school:\n\n**Jane Austen** is the Lena Dunham of Gentry Era fiction. She's a ruthlessly observational genius filled with radical ideas about women and romance. She's totally brutal, too. A good high school teacher will guide you to see how fucking hilarious Jane Austen is. She's a bitch, and she knows it, and she doesn't care. For example, There's a whole section in Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Bingley attempts to justify his bad handwriting by arguing that he's just really smart and thinks too quickly. Austen writes this dialogue so perfectly, so cunningly that, in the end, her character Elizabeth totally brings Mr. Bingley down to size. We've all met people like Mr. Bingley, is the thing. However, if you don't understand how Austen's humor works, it could come off as simply gentle banter. Furthermore, her legacy is still felt today.\n\n**Joseph Conrad** fathered (or at least perfected) a certain kind of thinking. His works combine intense societal critiques through the power of individual consciousness. Basically, he's one of the original \"the personal is the political\". Even if you don't like *Heart of Darkness*, you're never escaping its impact (which has been followed by many great socialist thinkers btw).\n\n**Mark Twain** basically created American literature. It was mostly very puritan before he came along to satirize the moralization and piety of American literature coming before him. There's no way in hell that some stuffy white men facilitated this. American writers like John Steinbeck, Faulkner, Don Delillo and I'd even argue Bret Easton Ellis have all learned lessons from Mark Twain. His lasting impression isn't because a couple of Harvard deans standing around in a room smoking cigars suddenly decided he's interesting. It's because he's a great writer, and writers after him have either copied him or tried to repurpose his techniques.\n\n **Shakespeare** literally somehow captured and predicted every single literary movement that has happened and probably will ever happen. If you feel a certain way, Shakespeare has written about it. If you don't like Shakespeare, it isn't because you're right. It's because you didn't have a good professor to guide you. I know that may make you feel insecure. How could one dude be so amazing? Well, he was, and you need to deal with it. Shakespeare is the only writer I can say this about with absolute confidence. With the proper introduction, he's one of the most fascinating writers (if not *the* most). But he absolutely needs a guide.\n\nThis goes into the very purpose of literature, which is this: if we want political progress, scientific progress, mathematical progress, we need to know how to redefine our own personal vocabularies. All great writers have, in some way or another, reinvigorated or dismantled the old cliches of their times to document the cultural, intellectual, and psychic changes they observed. Writers give us language we can use to explore our experiences, and reading in terms of a tradition helps us see how languages and conversations develop.\n\nIf you want to dismantle the cliches of conservative America, or SJW liberals, or Orthodox Christians, it helps tremendously to see how geniuses have done so in their own contexts.", "reference": "question: How and why are books like The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men chosen for reading in English classes? answer: I don't know, All I remember is that in secondary 5 (Quebec french school) I had to read \"Des souris et des hommes\" in french class and \"Les miser\u00e2b\" in english litterature at the same time... a whole semester hearing \"Jean Valjean\" in english when 100% of the students were native french speakers.

If a unit got separated, an officer might try to re-group it by yelling for his men to get back into formation.  The average soldier would also be yelling a battle cry, partly to induce fear in the enemy and partly as a unit identifier.  Language and accent would help identify who was who.", "reference": "question: In ancient and medieval times, how did soldiers distinguish friend from foe in battle?When I look at movies that have vikings etc in them, they have no regulation uniforms whatsoever and their enemies wear roughly the same looking gear. How did the soldiers know, who were the enemies?  answer: Battles used to be quite smaller in medieval times. Smaller units like viking raiders were small enough that everyone knew the face of everyone else on their side. These are people who travel together and live in the same camp together so they would be able to recognize each other, even if they did not remember everyones name. Just remember back to when you went to school with 3-400 other kids and would still be able to recognize people from your school if for example two schools were at the same sports event. This is the scale of most battles. Bigger battles were fought between mostly between different empires. So you would be able to tell people apart based on their gear. A polish knight would have a different style of armor then a french knight.\n\nThere were times throughout history when you would be able to gather enough men from similar regions to have a big battle. But this does require a lot of organization as you need to convince people though money or politics to take part in your war. It is easy to get people to the battlefield when the mongols or the crusades comes and invade your country, however it is much harder to summon people to the battlefield when the neighboring town stole your bucket. When you have an organized wealthy society that can manage such armies you would be able to equip your soldiers with some sort of uniform. Not all soldiers in an army would get the same uniform as they were often belonging to different mercenaries or independent lords. However remembering a few banners is much easier then a few thousand faces. The people under each banner were also kept away from each other for the most part.\n\nBut there are a lot of stories of friendly fires in medieval battles. Soldiers had a hard time recognizing allies in big battles and sometimes mistook their uniforms or banners. One such famous example happened in one of the battles in the war of the roses when a cavalry flanking charge were successful at driving an enemy to panic into opposing infantry forces. But this maneuver send the cavalry charging head on into friendly forces who did not recognize their banners. It was also not that uncommon for soldiers to stop and see if someone they did not know were a friend or foe would attack or not, sometimes even asking them directly. The movie Braveheart uses this as an element a few times and demonstrates how such confusion can happen in the heat of battle and how it can be resolved."}

If you work a normal 40-50 hour a week schedule, it can be really annoying when you have to go to the bank - it's almost like having to schedule a doctor's appointment. \n\nI've never really understood why banks are generally never open late. Is it because of some sort of regulation, governmental or self-imposed by the industry?  answer: I\u2019ll try to give both the short-winded answer and a long-winded answer. As a bit of background, I\u2019m an individual who worked in retail banking through school (for business, then changed to engineering), then stayed (probably shouldn\u2019t have, but I did). I\u2019ve been in banking about 11 years now. First in a small bank that was bought by a bigger bank that was bought by a bigger bank, and now in a small bank that became a mid-sized bank through growth. I\u2019ve held numerous positions from teller to management and now work in commercial real estate (on the banking side).\n\nTL;DR: The \u201cELI5\u201d answer, as some others have pointed out, is that banks are businesses and its biggest customers are other businesses. Thus, they need to be open when other businesses are open.  If ELI5 is exactly what you want and don\u2019t want any more information, stop reading now.\n\nTo fully understand why banks are open certain hours, you have to look at how banks make (and spend) their money. This is likely going to appear long-winded, but it\u2019s really simplified version of what happens, and mostly only on the retail side. The \u201ceasy button\u201d version of how banks make their money is that they lend money to people and businesses and collect a fee up front (for some loans) as well as collect interest. The money the banks lend to people comes from a couple places. \n\nThe bank can borrow it from another entity (the federal home loan bank, for example). The bank then has a \u201cspread\u201d over that loan, which the bank keeps for itself. \n\nThe other main avenue is deposits that the bank holds for its deposit customers. This one can be a bit less \u201ccut and dry,\u201d so you may want to hang on for a second, but I\u2019ll try to explain it as simply as I can. The bank offers multiple types of deposit products to multiple types of customers. The simplified version of this is Checking, Savings, and CD\u2019s. You can add in the retirement/pension version of these, but we\u2019ll skip over that for today. The bank pays interest to the deposit customer for (some of) these, and uses a portion of it to lend to borrowers. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s only a portion of the money that is allowed to be borrowed, and that percentage changes daily, depending on what the global deposit base looks like in each of those categories. Because CD\u2019s are \u201clocked in\u201d for a specified period of time, more of those funds are allowed to be lent out, as it is less likely that someone will come in tomorrow and close the account. Likewise, checking accounts are not only liquid, but are the most easily drained, as clients have debit cards, checks, and the ACH ability. Savings accounts are also liquid, but have some protections (limited number of withdrawals per month, etc). For this reason, not every penny you (as a consumer) deposit into the bank actually becomes borrowed funds, and if you only have checking and savings accounts, very little of it actually is. This is why your mortgage rate may be 4.75%, but you are earning \u201cnext to nothing\u201d on your savings account. If you can come in and withdraw it at any time, the bank can\u2019t count on it being there, and can\u2019t lend it all out.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been into an aggressive bank or seen commercials on TV, the above paragraph may confuse you. How could this be true if all banks seem to want my checking account? The answer to this is two-fold. Banks want you to have a checking account because it has a lot of moving parts. They\u2019re not actually all that profitable for the bank, but once you have a checking account (that you\u2019re actually using, hence the debit card/bill pay requirements), you\u2019re more likely to stay. It\u2019s more work for you to leave if you have automatic payments, checks that could clear, etc. Once you have an established checking account, you\u2019re more likely to establish more accounts (the more profitable ones). The more accounts you have, the deeper established you are, and it becomes even less likely that you\u2019ll leave. This is why if you\u2019ve ever tried to close an account, you may have experienced some \u201cgrappling\u201d trying to hold on to you, especially if you have a decent deposit in the bank. Retail employees are incentivized to get you to open more accounts (this is not a negative thing, so don\u2019t take it as such) and in some cases to \u201csave\u201d accounts.\n\nThere are two main approaches to the \u201cmost attractive\u201d client to a bank. Most banks try to utilize both, but some go after one or the other. The approach most consumers are familiar with is the \u201cblanket\u201d approach. This is where the bank attempts to get as many consumer (non-business) clients as it can. Consumers are agile and it doesn\u2019t take much work for them to leave. This makes it easier to steal them from other banks, but also more likely that they\u2019ll eventually leave. For this reason, one $1,000,000 account is often looked at as less valuable than ten $100,000 accounts. You\u2019re less likely to lose ten customers than one. At the same time, a windfall of $1,000,000 is incredibly helpful. The bank will likely offer them a higher interest rate to get them in the door, then if they threaten to leave, offer higher interest rates to get them to stay. One side-note on this topic is that checking accounts can often actually lose money for banks. They\u2019re really the \u201cgateway drug\u201d with the expectation that you\u2019ll be bringing more in. This is one reason that many banks stopped offering free checking, when they found their typical customer had a checking account (and that\u2019s it). The moving parts of a checking account actually cost the bank money, and they can\u2019t lend out a large amount of the money that is on deposit.\n\nThe other approach is the \u201cbusiness-customer\u201d approach. It can be harder to get businesses in the door, but once they\u2019re in, you\u2019re less likely to lose them. There are a couple reasons for this. First, they typically have many more moving parts than individuals. They have more cash management needs (for instance, remote deposit, cash couriers, online wires, ACH origination, etc), which the bank makes some money on, but they also often have more than one decision maker, and for the larger businesses, certain protocols for doing certain things. The banks can benefit from the bureaucracy involved in some of these cases. Again, this means that once you have a business client, you\u2019re more likely to keep them.\n\nIn addition to businesses being easier to keep (while higher maintenance, the bank usually offsets the higher maintenance with higher fees), businesses often keep higher balances. This means you\u2019re getting the best of both worlds. You get the $1,000,000 customer who also has a hard time leaving. As a side-note, if you look at business banking rate sheets versus consumer, you\u2019ll see that typically banks pay less interest to businesses as well.\n\nNow, you also have some costs to look at from the bank\u2019s perspective. One of the biggest costs being the salary cost. You have many departments that you have to pay, retail being one of those. Unless you\u2019re keeping retail hours open more hours than you find elsewhere in the bank, you pretty much have to align the hours somewhat closely. For instance, you need retail\u2019s support to be around when retail is. You need the various lending groups to be open when retail is (you have the same clients that will be utilizing both departments). You need the investment people around when retail is. You need management to be around when they are too. One of the departments (that appears to be going by the wayside in the industry) is the \u201cproof\u201d department. This is the department that \u201cre-processes\u201d all of the work that retail processed as a sort of double check. These people often worked much later, as they couldn\u2019t complete their work until retail was complete. With everything going digital, this is quickly changing.\n\nIf you need everyone around at basically the same time, then in some regards the \u201ctalent pool\u201d does make sense. You are not as likely to find a mid-to-high level executive willing to work second shift\u2026and they are managing people that work in retail. This is only a very VERY small part of it though and can almost be discounted.\n\nThe bigger piece of the puzzle circles back to what customers the bank really wants. The bank wants both business and consumer clients, but the business deposit clients provide the most money (for deposit) for the least amount of risk. That is where you will find the focus of most banks. Most businesses are open during \u201cbusiness hours,\u201d and thus that is where the bank aligns its hours. \n\nThere is some truth to the fact that the banks that are only open until 5PM will lose some of the consumer clients, and it\u2019s not that the bank doesn\u2019t want these clients (the truth is that it does), but there are a couple things preventing this ability. One of those is the salary cost. The number of clients that will come in the door between 5 PM and 7 PM is relatively low, especially when looked at from a depository standpoint. The bank is likely to see transactions, sure, but the big money is generally not going into the accounts during that time period. If you are keeping employees in the branch during those two hours per day (plus extra hours on Saturdays and Sundays), you are likely either increasing the amount of staff (read: increased benefits cost) or paying overtime, just to have coverage. Keep in mind that the bank still needs employees in the bank even if there are no clients, and for insurance purposes often needs at least three (security/safety reasons\u2026we can go further into that if you want). Often, by staying open those hours, you are literally spending more money than you are making, so it simply doesn\u2019t make sense from a business perspective to stay open. People often view banks as a utility, but the fact of the matter is that it is a business and has to make a profit and actually has to pay its employees."}

In our region, which is South East Asia, clannishness is the name of the game. The interesting thing is that the degree of emphasis on sticking with your family no matter how old you get actually varies too.

A lot of the awareness stuff just kind of normalizes this. It lets people know that survivors are people you know. They are your family, coworkers, classmates, people all around you.

Pretty damn good for an 18 year old kid right out of high school.  Except that we were forced to pay union dues as everyone else who made 25/hr.  Everyone in the union resented us.  18 year old kids and guys who just returned from Iraq just looking for jobs.  Our pay and names and positions were open information for the union members.  They did everything they could to get us fired for doing the same job better for nearly half of their pay with no benefits or vacation time.

There are many strategies for combating potential problems but frequent examination for clot formation is also necessary.\n\nThe problem with pathologically addicted gamers is that this awareness generally doesn't exist. Nobody tells you that if you game too much you'll end up with a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and die. Even if they do, few take it seriously.

{"candidate": "question: Why does salt preserve foods like meat? Can't bacteria live in salt? answer: Bacteria 'generally' need oxygen, a safe pH, moisture, and favorable temperature to survive/grow. Salt is hydrophilic, so it removes the moisture from things that have moisture. When you salt something, you are technically starting a 'cooking' process. Check out books on cooking theory, it will open your mind as to what kinds of things you can do to create awesome dishes. Learning a solid cooking theory is kind of like learning the fundementals of how to draw. Once you learn your theory, you can apply it to all sorts of food based on what they are made up of (is it a watery veggie, is it a starchy veggie, is it a solid fruit, does it break down when you add heat very quickly, etc) and it will make it easier to cook things that you haven't worked with before. You can use theory to really focus on creativity rather than copying things you find online without knowing why you add the salt to and wrap the sliced zuchinni with paper towels before grilling it.", "reference": "question: Why does salt preserve foods like meat?

{"candidate": "question: Why is there a blood shortage? Hospitals charge like $800 per unit. Why don't they pay $250 for a donation. Everyone would donate. ELI5 answer: My company gives us PTO (paid time off) to donate blood. If we give three times in a fiscal year, we get one day. If we give six times (which is the max you can give), we get two. My company also has a policy allowing us to sell back PTO during open enrollment. As such, I can sell back the two days I earn and get paid a decent chunk for each time I donate. \n\nI never before gave blood before working for this company... Never had the incentive. I'm proof that paying for donors works.", "reference": "question: Why is there a blood shortage? Hospitals charge like $800 per unit. Why don't they pay $250 for a donation. Everyone would donate. ELI5 answer: Guess I am late to this party but it is the area of my expertise.\n\nThere is no over-arching, on-going national blood shortage.  Blood usage for non-trauma purposes and the total number of units of blood being collected is falling nation wide.  Orthopedic surgery in particular has gone from 6-7 units of blood to rarely needing any for lots of common procedures over the past 20 years.  The Red Cross has actually been shutting down blood banks and consolidating.  Of course lower total usage means lower standing inventory levels means less ability to absorb spikes.  Harder forecasting, apparent shortages.\n\nShelf life and storage capacity are both quite low, making regional inventory levels vulnerable.  A bag of blood is legal for 35 to 42 days depending on what they mix in it, but it's not like it's new and shiny until midnight on the 35th day and then turns green.  In reality doctors know it's badly degrading after two weeks or so.  Blood that is getting older will preferably only be used in emergencies when nothing else compatible is found.\n\nLots of blood gets thrown out.  It expires.  It goes out of temperature range during transport.  The container is compromised.  Or it's ordered and never used.  (Once it's out of the controlled environment of the hospital blood bank and sitting on a cart in the ER for hours they're not allowed to just take it back and toss it in the fridge for someone else, it is trash.)  So the cost of one is also covering the cost of the lost overhead expense on unused units.  (Affects what it would be reasonable to be able to pay per-donation.  I don't work on the hospital side, don't know a firm number of what % collected units go unused nationally.)\n\nFor donors who are compensated in the US (that is, plasma) the protocols are more stringent, there is a lot of extra work the clinic is required to do to make sure you're a legitimate donor.  Blood Banks aren't set up for this, it's more work, more staff.  Some of the rules used to make compensated plasma donations acceptable just don't really translate onto blood banking.  Imagine the task and cost of developing a protocol to assert a compensated donation is safe for use and getting it past the US FDA...!"}

{"candidate": "question: Why does congress have a 13% approval rate but incumbents are re-elected at a rate of 90%. answer: I wish my laptop worked as i could type this much faster. Here goes.\n\nApproval rating overall doesn't have much effect on specific people who get elected. Viewing congress as a whole is different than how people view their individual elected officials, particularly because you can pinpoint the projects a local official has taken part in and relate personally.\n\nMore importantly, incumbency and re election is a separate beast that rides on two main factors: name recognition and money. Incumbent re elections are very high because their names are at least recognized due to already having campaigned and been in office. People trust things they at lest have heard of. \n\nNext- money. Money is used to get  name recognition. Money is spent on flyers, signs, canvassing, events, renting office space, cold calling, paying finance directors to call people to get more money, etc. incumbents are already in the lead here because they already have the names of people they need to call, they already have franking privileges (mailing ) which saves a shitload of money. They have databases with information readily compiled from previous election runs. So a non-incumbent has to work a ton harder to raise money and get her name out there. \n\nThis kills me i cant keep typing maybe i write more later when laptop fixed", "reference": "question: Why does congress have a 13% approval rate but incumbents are re-elected at a rate of 90%. answer: How has gerrymandered districts not come up yet?

{"candidate": "question: What does the term, \"taxpayers have to pay for it\" really mean?When speaking of anything in Government, any expense usually comes with the phrase, \"the taxpayers will have to pay for it\". How does the cost of something trickle down to taxpayers? Do our taxes go up and down every year depending on the budget? answer: Government is a service. The taxpayer is the served entity. Taxes are the means of payment. Governments have literally zero other income.\n\nNow you have probably been (mis)taught to think of government as a burden, but that's typically (in \"the west\") a illusion brought about by the fact that neither you, nor anybody you've likely spoken to at length, have ever lived outside of the protection of a government.\n\nSo every day you are privileged to _not_ need to step over starved corpses while dodging swarms of beggar children. When you turn on the taps there is usually water. When you turn on the switch there's usually light. The roads between home and whatever destination have a relatively reasonable level of wear and a minimal level of threat. You don't pay two-thirds of your income to a local warlord. That sort of thing.\n\nSo we pay taxes and fees under force of law because people are generally too stupid to fully understand why, if they live in city-A, the quality of roads in city-B may be vital to their survival.\n\nBasically people _want_ \"pay as you go\" (toll roads and such) to be true because they don't understand where their goods and services have been.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nSo your government doesn't have a stock portfolio. It's not independently wealthy. You, me, all of us pay for every single thing our government does. The government has to take in money to pay for every salary and paperclip and photocopy just like you and your job do.\n\nNothing is free.\n\nSo the government wants you to make as much money as you can make, because for every dollar you earn, they get thirty cents or so. If they can double your income they double their own.\n\nSo if someone needs the government to do anything for them, then the government pays for that out of the government's bank accounts, or by taking a loan.\n\nAnd just like you personally, if the government takes a loan today they still have to pay for things tomorrow, but now they also have a loan payment to make.\n\nSo generally the taxes you pay are based on what you earn, not the expenses the government has. It would be impossible to tune the monthly and yearly tax rates to the actual expenses.\n\nInstead, in an expensive year, loans are taken out. In a frugal year loans are repaid and \"surpluses\" arise.\n\nNow we, in the U.S. of late have had a problem. It is _popular_ to promise \"no new taxes\", as in no increases in taxation. But it's not _healthy_ to keep taking loans.\n\nSo various people in government promise to \"make up the difference\" by cutting various programs. But all those programs came into existence for one reason or another. You cut \"meals on wheels\" and those cuts are measured in starving senior citizens.\n\nSo people, again, being stupid about understanding what they are actually getting for any particular dollar, think saving XXX dollars from some social program is \"a bargain\" because _they_ \"don't need\" that program.\n\nBut the system is actually sort of fragile. Every time you starve one guy, you are giving that guy a motive to violate the social contract just to feed himself and his family.\n\nMeanwhile, if you cut this other program, say a defense contract, then some corporation might lay off five thousand people, and that cut then take the income tax from five thousand people out of the tax base and maybe even costs the taxpayer for their unemployment and food stamp benefits. And if they lose their houses then the mortgage loss insurance comes out of the tax income _and_ the property values go down costing property tax income.\n\nMeanwhile, some political interests \"cheat\". The entire middle-east war under G.W. was kept out of the official budget for nearly seven years. So a lot of loans were taken out but then the next president had to pay the bill instead.\n\nSo just like someone trying to scam extra time out of the power company by \"forgetting\" to sign the check they sent, there are various interests in various government offices that are trying to hide or shift blame for various expenses.\n\nSo there's all these forces and people of varying interests and agendas and they all want their \"absolutely necessary\" programs to get funding, and they all disparage someone else's \"absolutely necessary\" programs because, as stated, the average person has no clue what they are getting for their tax dollar.\n\nThe public spends hours and hours chasing pennies while billions of dollars flow around unnoticed.\n\nBut at the core, _eventually_ everything is paid for in tax dollars collected from tax payers.\n\nEVERYTHING.\n\nSo the various tax cuts and schemes come out of peoples pockets in the end.\n\nFor example, the whole \"trickle down economics\" scam was predicated on the idea that if we stopped asking the very rich for more money, the money the got to keep would end up employing \"more people\" and so raising the total tax collected. Unfortunately the truth is that the very rich don't spend all their money every month the way the very poor do. And if they get close they buy more expensive equipment. But that more expensive stuff took the same number of people to make. The guy pressing out the expensive brushed steel case makes about the same amount of money as the guy pressing out the cheap plastic case.\n\nSo the government wants as many people to have the best jobs possible.\n\nAnd lots of people have theories about how to get that maximum number of people in the best paying jobs possible.\n\nBut a lot of those theories don't make any sense. Like doubling the number of people working at Wal Mart doesn't do any good if the average Wal Mart employee needs to be on food stamps. And keeping the minimum wage so low that the average minimum wage worker doesn't pay any taxes is a bum deal as well.\n\nOther jokes are the resistance to \"free\" healthcare. Right now we send uninsured ear aches to the emergency room, so we \"save\" the cost of just giving them regular health care, but then we _spend_ three thousand dollars to give them eight bucks worth of antibiotics.\n\nSo the theories abound.\n\nThe old saying is \"penny wise but pound (e.g. dollar) foolish\". We are supposed to be hiring experts to tell us which pennies and dollars are which, but our elections are just popularity contests. And the tricky choices don't _win_ popularity contests.\n\nSubsequently we elect people based on how well they sell those theories and which theories we choose to believe in.\n\nBut every benefit gained, and every boondoggle lost... always comes as a bill due to the tax payer eventually.", "reference": "question: What does the term, \"taxpayers have to pay for it\" really mean?When speaking of anything in Government, any expense usually comes with the phrase, \"the taxpayers will have to pay for it\". How does the cost of something trickle down to taxpayers? Do our taxes go up and down every year depending on the budget? answer: The government has two main ways to get money: taxes and borrowing. Borrowing is limited by who will lend and too much government borrowing is considered bad. So while taxes don't change much year-to-year because borrowing more or less can make up the change in budget, in the long run if government spending goes up then so will taxes."}

You are actually getting things like cancer all the time, but your body is good at error detection and destroying compromised cells.\n\nThis is also why a singular \"cure for cancer\" is sort of a silly concept right now. Cancer is an entire categorization of things, and it's completely possible to have a completely unique cancer. What can be worked on are treatments for cancer and cures for very specific cancers. Childhood leukemia, for example, has a cure rate of 90%, and we are approaching the point where we can sort of call it cured.\n\nWe are also a lot better at diagnosing cancer now. Death records in the past included causes like \"heartbreak\", \"suddenness\", \"found dead in street\", \"stomach pains\", and etc."}

{"candidate": "question: Do dogs understand their names, or do they just think it's a command meaning \"come here\" or \"look at me\"?[removed] answer: Dog's do not pass a mirror test so it's highly unlikely they have a sense of self.  For example if your dog's name is Fido, he doesn't understand Fido's place in the world.  \n\nThey do recognize there names, it's a bit of an illusion though.  For example if you have two dogs, and you give one of them a treat when you say Fido, and the other when you say Clifford, they learn that the respective words only apply to them.  \n\nFido knows he will never get a treat when he hears Clifford and Clifford knows he will never get a treat when he hears Fido.  \n\nSo do they know that \"they are Fido,\" or they are \"Clifford,\" no, but they can recognize the command only applies to them. \n\nYou can take this pretty far, for example you can say Fido come, and they will learn only to come if their name proceeds.  However you can do this w/ a two syllable command.  For example teach your dog to leave a treat on the floor until you say okay.  \n\nThen start saying things like Oklahoma or Oh Boy.  The dog can be trained to only move on okay.  So when you expand this to \"Fido come,\" they aren't learning \"the name,\" they are learning the multiple syllables that apply to them as they don't understand them as \"words,\" either.  \n\nWhich you can further break down just using random sounds.  Dogs will even learn that different whistles apply to different dogs and so on.    \n\nEdit: For reference regarding \"scent tests.\"  _URL_0_", "reference": "question: Do dogs understand their names, or do they just think it's a command meaning \"come here\" or \"look at me\"?[removed] answer: A theory is in fact they actually attenuate the name you give them to more or less something that they relate with when someone addresses them.\n\nThey don't have the concept of ownership and self though, so basically they know the word means you are speaking to them but they have no concept of what names are."}

This is one of the biggest statements the prison system makes, that reform is their main goal asking with punishment. Implementing it has been difficult but the transition is coming along. Many prisons offer programs that would have been laughed at 40 years ago. Education programs, work release programs, mental health programs etc. The problem really lies with us, the American public. We've made it clear we want to know people's past and be able to judge them accordingly. Mainly because of things like the recidivism rate being so high. Which comes back around to poor reform.

{"candidate": "question: How after 5000 years of humanity surviving off of bread do we have so many people within the last decade who are entirely allergic to gluten? answer: Actual medically diagnosed gluten sensitivities, due either to Celiac Disease or allergy, remain extremely rare. There is zero evidence that either of those conditions are any more common today than they were a thousand years ago.\n\nHowever, they do exist. There are, and always have been, people among us who are negatively impacted by gluten. The difference is that those people now have access to social media where they can tell many, many people at a time how terrible their symptoms are. And a lot of those people hear that and wrongly believe that gluten is bad for everybody. They begin to manifest psychosomatic symptoms, futher convincing them. Then they find out, after further research, that not everybody has this sensitivity. But their imagined symptoms convince them that they themselves do. Thus is born their claim of gluten sensitivity in the absence of any medical diagnosis. \n\nThe same exact thing has happened with aspartame. There is an exceedingly rare condition called phenylketonuria that makes aspartame very toxic to its sufferers. I knew a girl in highschool who had it. Aspartame would give her seizures. But, like I said, it's rare. For anybody without phenylketonuria, aspartame is harmless. But the symptoms of phenylketonuria hit social media and people read about it and concluded that aspartame must be terribly toxic! The result is that a huge movement of scientifically illiterate people are now anti-aspartame. Nevermind that this logic is exactly the same as saying that nobody should ever eat seafood because some people are allergic to it.

Edit: front page, thanks guys, shout out to Lars Tim and Mallory for reading this. answer: This is related to neurons' refractory period. When a neuron fires, it needs time to reset the charged particles it has to fire again. If it has to fire again before it has fully recovered, it will fire with less intensity than it previously had. If it has to continually fire, it will gradually decrease in intensity. So as the neurons in your ear fire all day, they fire less to louder noises and you need to turn up the volume on things. After you sleep in a quiet room all night, the neurons \"recharge\" and quieter things can set them off again.\n\nEdit: Shouldn't have said desensitization."}
{"candidate": "question: how does tuning an instrument (like guitar) down help musicians hit higher notes singing? answer: It doesn't. The singer still has an achievable range of notes in their voice. Tuning an instrument down doesn't allow them to go above the range, but what it does is tune down the entire key of the song down by a relative amount. That means that if a singers' top note in their range is a high D for example, and the top note in the song (with normal tuning) is a high E, tuning the instrument down a step allows the singer to sing the song a note further down the scale which would then make the high note in the song a high D, and therefore achievable by the singer.", "reference": "question: how does tuning an instrument (like guitar) down help musicians hit higher notes singing? answer: If the pitch of the song is too high for the singers voice to comfortably sing, lowering the octave can allow the singer to hit the notes."}

{"candidate": "question: How many sides can a shape have before it becomes a circle and does the concept of geometry exist on the very small scale?[removed] answer: If we're dealing in perfect polygons(equilateral triangle,square,pentagon,etc) the angle of each corner is always the same. The most common measurement for angles is degrees(90 degree angle for square). Degrees can be split into 60 minutes, which in turn can be split into 60 seconds. This gives you 360 spaces within each degree angle. 360 times 360 equals 129,600, meaning the closest thing to a circle in this measurement system has 129,600 sides. You can technically split things up further, but as far as I have discovered, I do not know of any mathematical usage for such. If you use a different angle measurement system, like gradians, you can go further, but again I don't know what it would accomplish. For funsies, the Megagon is a million-sided polygon with an inside angle of 179.99964 degrees, or 199.999603411 gradians. So close to a circle that each side would have to be a football field long for you to notice the difference.\n\nEdit: I took this a step further because I made myself curious. If the side of a perfect megagon was 100 yards long, and one side was flat on the ground, the far end of the next side would be 0.000628 yards, or two one-hundredths of an inch, off the ground. So a football field isn't even enough. Let's up the ante.

I'm sure there are many other examples, but those are two that I can come up with off the top of my head.\n\nJudging by the wiki entry on handedness, there is no actual consensus on the matter.

Humans cooperate using tools all the time. A right handed tool will not necessarily work for a left handed person. In this case, humans evolved to create a hand dominance through cooperation. Those early civilizations that had a hand dominance were able to cooperate more, which led to better successes. Why it was the right hand could be just considered coincidence.\n\nSo why do we have left handed dominance? That's because just as important as it was to cooperate, it was also just as important to compete. If you look at professional athletes today, almost %50 of them are left handed, which is an extremely higher percentage than total number of left handed people (less than 10%). Civilizations that had at least *some* left hand dominant people were able to compete better.\n\nTL;DR - Majority dominance allows more cooperation. Minority dominance allows better competition."}

For starters, the Shiites [control much of the arable land near the persian gulf](_URL_1_) (Thanks to u/perevod for the map).  The Sunnis have been mostly ejected from Baghdad and the surrounding areas over the years.  When carving up an oil rich, difficult to farm territory like Iraq you'll inevitably get conflicts about who owns what.  Neither side is likely to peacefully yield valuable farmland and oil fields to the other, regardless of who is currently residing there.\n\nThere's also the Turkey problem.  There are large populations of Kurds in Syria and Turkey.  The Iraqi and Syrian Kurds are effectively autonomous at this point, those In iraq have their own government, military, and utilities infrastructure.  The Syrian government has little influence in Kurdish regions of Syria, preferring to defend their strongholds and let the Kurdish Peshmerga, FSA, and ISIS fight over the rest.\n\nThe Kurds in Turkey have been fighting an on-and-off war of independence to break away from Turkey and join their Iraqi and Syrian brothers in forming an independent Kurdish state.  Turkey strongly opposes this and the US has been reluctant to support the Kurdish forces in ways that will strengthen the independence movement.  The US and Turkey have been close allies since the Cold War, but the relationship has broken down in recent years as the region has destabilized.\n\n2) Why hasn't Bashar Al-Assad's military dissolved like the Iraqi military?\n\nA large number of Syrian military forces actually did defect to the Free Syrian Army early in the conflict, but they weren't able to hold off the more numerous (and better funded) loyalist forces in the long term.\n\nThe loyalist forces are a minority religious sect known as the Alawites, and they've been targets of harassment and oppression in the region for centuries.  Al-Assad's remaining forces are fiercely loyal because they're defending their people from discrimination at the hands of the rebels and execution at the hands of ISIS.\n\nThere is a similar situation forming in Iraq.  The Sunni members of the military have largely disappeared since ISIS is a Sunni group and treats them reasonably well.  The Shiite members have retreated to the Shiite territory and joined forces with the old [Shiite militias](_URL_0_).  Together they actually do form a formidable fighting force, one that will be able to defend Baghdad from ISIS indefinitely if it comes to that.\n\nIn both countries you're seeing the military splinter along religious and ethnic lines, with the ruling party's forces staying loyal but opting to only defend their territory, not the nation as a whole.\n\nIt all comes back to the original issue, there is no Iraq and there is no Syria.  There are Alawites, Sunnis, and Shiites.  There are Arabs, Persians, and Kurds.  There are many groups fighting for many things, but none of them care much for the notion of Iraq and Syria in their 20th century form."}

{"candidate": "question: How are sociopaths able to have such magnetic personalities and appear likable when they have no empathy?Isn't empathy neccissary in order to relate/connect with someone? I've hear sociopaths are excellent at getting people to like them initially. The two seem to contradict eachother. answer: I went to a therapist for awhile because of some issues within my family and I discovered I was a sociopath. they sent me to a psychiatrist and I found out after, and I still kept seeing my therapist. The thing is, You'd never notice because I have no trouble making friends and unless I told you, which I never do because people think I'm some murderous, crazy bastard. \n\nNow mind you, there are several different kinds of sociopathy and it really varies for each person. There are different levels of severity as well, and I'm not a full fledged sociopath, but the psychiatrist I saw told me that I showed signs of a \"sociopathic personality\" so, the way my therapist explained it to me, was basically having a better grasp at the cause and effect of situations that deal with emotions and are much more keen to the emotions of others while not stopping to think of our own sometimes. It was really just a nicer way of telling me how I have a tendency to be manipulative, which is totally true. We notice little things and take mental notes and analyze how certain behaviors and actions affect people, and we can use that to our advantage. This is why you see a lot of sociopaths who are police officers, because who can be better at tricking you into giving up that pot in your glovebox after simply stopping you for a broken tail light, than a master of manipulation? \n\nAnother thing, is that we're very, very good liars. I have all my friends convinced that I'm just a regular joe, and not a sociopath. How have I done that? Lying. I've lied to my parents, friends, family, you name it, I've probably lied to it. Sociopaths always have ulterior motives, but you'd never know because we've done so well at convincing you otherwise. \n\nNow about the whole, lack of empathy part, it's not that we're cold hearted bastards with no soul, we're just more accepting at being an asshole than others. Which is really the simplest way I can explain being a sociopath. I have feelings. I love my friends and I don't have many, but my closely knit friend group would never be under the influence of my sociopathic super powers, because I don't have to. Did I use them to get them to like me more in the first place? Yes, but they'll never know. There's just certain things that we have no problem in not having a guilty conscience about. Am I buying you a drink because I'm just deciding to be nice? Nope. I'm buying you a drink because in the future I know you'll buy me one and you'll tell your friends and then they'll possibly buy me drinks. who doesn't like free drinks every once in awhile? \n\nSociopaths are really misunderstood, and I'd really suggest that anyone who thinks they might be a sociopath, talks to their doctor or goes to see a psychiatrist.

I've hear sociopaths are excellent at getting people to like them initially. The two seem to contradict eachother. answer: Not a sociopath, and certainly not an expert, but I can make analogies pretty well.\n\nWhen you learn to write at a young age, your habits stick with you for your entire life. For instance, I learned to hold the pencil the wrong way, and therefore I will forever have bad handwriting. In addition, I picked up many bad writing habits (such as starting from the bottom and not finishing at the top) and overall, my writing technique leaves shaky, uneven letters.\n\nWhen I was younger this could have been fixed, because I was learning the mechanics and details of writing. Writing was very akin to drawing a series of pictures, and each time I wrote letters and sentences it was kind of like relearning everything. Each time I was figuring out the best way to draw the pictures, and I was experimenting.\n\nHowever, now writing letters is routine. It's no longer like drawing pictures, I'm just writing the letters I always have, in the same way I always have. The TV show White Collar explains this very well; if you want to forge a signature, forge it upside-down. That way, you aren't rewriting the text in front of you, you're drawing an unfamiliar picture that happens to be the upside-down text of the name you want to forge.\n\nLikeable social habits aren't hard to replicate, and almost everyone knows what the likeable habits are and what the unlikeable habits are.  But non-sociopaths have been living and breathing these habits their entire lives. It comes naturally. It's routine. It's writing letters. If we tried really, really hard, and changed our mindset, maybe we could present ourselves as likeable, magnetic people, just like many sociopaths. But that would go against our nature and our natural personalities. It'd be putting up a mask.\n\nSociopaths don't feel these emotions. At least, not to the same extent. Many feel like they need to replicate these emotions to fit into normal society, but it's not a real emotion that they're feeling. It's a show, or a mask. They're presenting themselves in a certain way contrary to what they're actually feeling. And the way they present themselves is the one that makes social life easiest. The one that makes everyone like them and everything agreeable. They become magnetic, likeable people by mimicing the likeable traits that they've observed in others. They're not writing the routine letters. They're copying the pictures."}

There's a synergistic effect of all these systems working together, and you can mentally steel yourself to the cold, but no one has seemed to mention the largest contributing factor; cholesterol.\n\nCholesterol is a very important molecule in physiology.

{"candidate": "question: Why do i feel so tired when I've slept for 10 hours instead of 8? And also, why the headache? answer: As was said before, the headache is from dehydration and low blood-sugar.  The reason breakfast is called breakfast is because you've been fasting for approx. 8 hours and you're now breaking the fast.\n\nAs to why you're feeling sleepy and such, your brain isn't sleeping as long as it *wants*, exactly.  Your brain doesn't *want* sleep, but it *needs* sleep, and the amount that it needs any give time varies.  The research on what goes on in an overslept brain isn't nearly as extensive as what goes on in an underslept brain.  And so its hard to say exactly why you specifically experience this.  It could be sleep deficit, or the fact that you aren't getting enough sleep the majority of the time, and so when you oversleep you're catching up on lost sleep and paying interest on it, too. \n\nThe core of it is that your brain goes on a roller-coster ride of deep and light sleep as it bathes in different hormones and chemicals while you're unconcious.  If you have a strict schedule of sleep that you adhere to consistently many days in a row, your brain adapts to that pattern and knows just how many cycles it has time to run through before you wake it and makes sure it gets through them to get the most out of your rest.  Your brain doesn't wake itself up from sleep, though, external stimuli trigger the rush of hormones that cause you to wake up.  Before modern conveniences like A/C, and curtains, the gradual warming of the air and increased amount of light shining through your eyelids was your external stimuli.  The crowing of the rooster or the ring of the alarm clock replaced those stimuli since we sleep in light-sheltered climate-controlled environments...so sleeping in isn't letting your brain sleep as long as it wants, its just removing the signal your brain relies on to know it needs to wake up.\n\nThis is important because while its in sleep mode, it just keeps repeating those hormone and chemical bath cycles over and over again based on how many it expects to fit into its expected amount of sleep.  But it doesn't get the stimuli it was expecting, and keeps going until some other stimulus triggers wakefulness.  At this point, it could be in the middle of a cycle that now won't get finished because your brain (typically) knows better than to start bathing in sleep hormones while you're walking around and doing things.  And that's primarily why you're groggy and sleepy for so much longer after waking up from over sleeping.", "reference": "question: Why do i feel so tired when I've slept for 10 hours instead of 8?

What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling answer: Remember, nothing is black and white.\n\n1. We start with the Maidan or the EuroMaidan , the \"pro-west\" \"revolution\" that happened in the capital of Ukraine.The revolution happened because the then-current president Yanukovich backed of a EU trade aggreament that would have opened the gates of Ukraine to the EU and vice versa. Now the problem here lies with the importing of EU goods in Ukraine which would've crashed the local market and also the terms of the trade agreement were generally not favorable for the Ukrainian population (gas prices going up , wages frozen etc) which the population of Ukraine might or might not realize. Now after Yanukovich backed out of the EU trade deal he made a deal with Russia which gave Ukraine a lot of money (~15 bil euro) and privileges prices for gas.\n2. After Yanukovich fled they installed the pro-west government. The problem is that Ukraine is a diverse country with a couple of parts that are predominantly Russian (parts of east Ukraine and crimea) which didnt take too kindly to the new government comprised of parties that before the revolution were nobodies (exaggeration). The main party (the party of Yanukovich) that won 48.95% of the votes on the last election is not represented. So firstly the new government is illegal (not elected by voting) and secondly it doesnt represent all of the parties in Ukraine.\n2. The deep water port Sevastopol and the Crimean peninsula (with historical and cultural significance to the Russian people) which Russia currently leases from Ukraine. \nSide note: The Crimea has historically been a part of Russia until 1954 when it was \"gifted\" to Ukrainian Socialist Republic as \"symbolic gesture,\" marking the 300th anniversary of Ukraine becoming a part of the Russian Empire.\n3. Which brings us to the part where Crimea is predominantly Russian (linguistically and ethnically) with ~60% being ethnically russian.\nRussia is probably using Crimea either to gain leverage with the new government so that it gets back some semblance of power so that they appoint more pro-russia people in the government or in the case the Ukrainian government doesnt break they just hold the Crimean peninsula until Crimea declares independence (the voting for which is scheduled for 30th of March).", "reference": "question: What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country?

Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? answer: Companies in the US frown on employees discussing salaries. That started so companies can pay Jill 35,000 dollars a year starting out, but pay Joan 40,000 starting out without Jill being pissed. Maybe Joan negotiated her starting salary better than Jill. Maybe Joan's track record was better at a different company. The reason doesn't really matter why it's higher or lower, but the company doesn't wanna deal with Jill talking to Joan about pay and getting pissed and start demanding more money.

{"candidate": "question: If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease? answer: Hi, just an example: When my daughter was 2 years old, she got Rota-Virus. It is pretty nasty, because you lose fluid and electrolytes through diarrhea and vomiting. It can be transmitted through fluids and air. We took her to the infection hospital and my wife spent the night there. I took over in the morning. Our daughter was pumped with fluids and electrolytes (IV) throughout the night and in the morning she recovered enough to be hungry. I was allowed to take her home on the same day. My wife got the symptoms that very day. I got them one day later. Here I can state that I never contracted anything else from my daughter \u2013 virosis or flu, despite taking care of her when she got it. It is simply the fact that when you change diapers 20 times a day, there is a good chance you\u00b4ll miss something and get it into your system. I lost 6 kg in 4 days, feeling my body being drained of fluids. Good thing is that as a grown man, you can force yourself to drink and eat despite the symptoms and push through.  I have heard of grown people being hospitalized because of Rota-Virus and I don\u00b4t think that it can compete with Ebola any more than sniffles do. I learned to appreciate child creme at the time. Wiping 20 times a day can be...sandpapery. :)", "reference": "question: If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease? answer: since when in history is 'bodily fluids' not easy to contract?"}
{"candidate": "question: Why are politicians always criticized for \"flip-flopping\" when their views likely changed over time to represent those more in line with the voting population (as an elected representative's opinions ostensibly ought to)?[removed] answer: A few reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's because the general population treat politics like a partisan sport, not civic duty.  When it's *your* politician, it's an \"evolution of their understanding.\"  When it's *their* politician, flip flopping, and a sign of hypocrisy. \n\nAdditionally, it kind of *is* a sign of hypocrisy, or at least untrustworthyness.

Tell the liberals you are pro choice, tell the conservatives you are pro life. Tell the liberals you are pro gun control, tell the conservatives you are anti gun control. A flip-flopper only says what a crowd wants to hear.\n\nSomeone who changes their view over time by analyzing a situation and watching how the variables change is NOT a flip-flopper.\n\nFor a fictional scenario, let's use gun control. If Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton back in 1992 said that they were against gun control and a bunch of massacres started appearing at an exponential rate to the point where a gun-related crime happened at least once every week, then it would be obvious to raise gun control in 2017. They aren't flip-flopping on their previous ideals, they are making changes to adapt to 2017's environment. If in November they said they were pro abortion and in December they were anti abortion, and in January back to pro abortion, then you have a flip-flopper."}

If you help someone commit a crime, even if they could have gotten help from someone else or done it themselves, it's still also a crime.", "reference": "question: Why Piratebay creator is in prison if it was the users who added illegal content? answer: In 1908, a bunch of countries got together and signed an agreement called \"1908 modification of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\" (aka Berne Convention) in Berlin.\n\nOne of the topics they discussed was that:\n\n*Hey, its fucking hard to sue individual copyright infringers because there are so many of those bastards and none of them have money! Our important citizens/copyright holders/lobbyers are asking us implement some law that allows them to sue those guys who enables mass infringement and have deep pockets to sue while making it easy for us as we only need to sue one person.*\n\nSo they agreed to say that anyone who *authorises* infringement (secondary infringement) is just as guilty as the people who commits it (aka primary infringement).\n\nBut it was really up to each individual country to adopt that agreement into local domestic legislation with their precise wording. Just because you sign an international agreement, it wont come into effect until you make legislation for it. \n\nTypically, the way most cases have interpreted this vague word is that if they had some combination of the following factors:\n\n* the defendant had technical control to prevent infringement and did nothing about it to prevent it or even turned a blind eye (or even worse, actively promoted it which is what piratebay pretty much did)\n\n* it would have been very easy (ie not a lot of time and money) for the defendant to control/prevent infringement\n\n* they were made aware of the infringing activities\n\n* their business model was reliant on heavy usage of infringing activity (ie legitimate use was minimal compared to illegitimate use) \n\nFor example, a famous case in Australia called iiNet where the ISP was sued for this reason, they satisfied everything except for the fact that they could not easily prevent all those infringing activities.\n\nThe Piratebay creator was probably one of the most easiest cases to find that it was illegal under authorisation out all of the authorisation cases in history. \n\nTaking him to prison is something that the international agreement didnt require each country to do - the addition of criminality must have been added by the jurisdiction he was found guilty for."}

I wipe off the outside with a rag and then wipe off the inside with another dry rag. My common sense then tells me that I should be able to see clearly.

{"candidate": "question: why is car insurance mandatory, but mandatory health insurance is \"unconstitutional\"?[removed] answer: Car insurance is not mandatory.\n\nHowever, if you own a car, then liability insurance (insurance for damage you cause to others, not yourself) is typically required by most states. New Hampshire, whose state motto is \"Live Free or Die\", does not require car insurance.\n\nThere is no federal mandate on car insurance for car owners. The requirement comes from each individual state who set their own requirements for registering a vehicle. \n\nIf you do not own a car, you do not need to purchase insurance. If you do, your state will determine if you do. \n\nThere is a federal mandate on health insurance, and a financial penalty if you do not purchase. There is no way around this. \n\nNow as for health insurance mandate being unconstitutional or not, this is an opinionated argument based upon the constituion and a combination of court rulings over the years. It is not a fact, it is an opinion on the interpretation of the constituion. \n\nThe argument and court rulings are rather complex, so the simplest way to describe the argument is that many feel it is unconstitutional for the federal government to force citizens to buy a particular good or service.\n\nSo the main difference between the two is car insurance is not federally required, it is a state requirement in states that have chosen to pass a law only for those citizens that choose to own a car... meanwhile, health insurance is a federal mandate on all citizens.", "reference": "question: why is car insurance mandatory, but mandatory health insurance is \"unconstitutional\"?[removed] answer: tl;dr car insurance is really to  help protect other people.

We would set our ropes in between two or four windows and pendulum to reach the glass on either side as we dropped, using a suction cup to stay put in front of the glass once we swung out.  One man could wash a row of four windows from roof to ground in about 30 minutes (depending on wind and other factors). A crew of five men could wash a forty story building in one or two days.

But really, why is it none of my business? What caused this social taboo? Is it rooted in Victorian or Medieval or Middle Ages beliefs? answer: It's only taboo among the middle class. The very rich have their incomes plastered all over magazines ranking their wealth, so it's no secret. The poor are routinely required to submit proof of their income for all sorts of reasons. And, given that the day-to-day life experience of a poor person is about trying to get by on less-than-enough, there's a lot of talk among the poor about how much things cost relative to how much they make. \n\nSo really, for a rich person, keeping their wealth a secret is like a celebrity going on a talk show and trying not to mention what they do for a living, while a poor person keeping their poverty a secret is a little like a convict trying to keep it a secret that they live in prison, or a quadriplegic keeping it a secret that they're handicapped.\n\nThat still leaves the question of why the middle class is so weird about this. I think it's because they aspire to be rich, and feel like it's their own fault that they're not, but they're more likely to come into contact with very poor people than very rich ones. So they're judging themselves for not earning enough, and yet feeling proud of what they do earn, and perhaps feeling ashamed of having unearned privileges when they're around the poor. It's a precarious position. You never know if someone's going to give you a hard time because you make too much or because you make too little, so they just avoid the topic altogether."}

Insofar: 142857 is a factor of one less than a power of 10 (specifically, 999999); 999999/142857 gives 7, a prime number; 7 is less than the base of our number system (10); 10 does not produce a remainder of 1 after dividing by 7.\n\n*Basically* what's happening is that y\n\nFirst part:\n\nIf a number has *n* digits, dividing it by 999...9 (where there are *n* 9's) will produce an infinite decimal consisting exactly of that number repeating. To show this, start with the decimal:\n\n     0.142857142857142857...\n\nand break it up into the repeating components:\n\n     0.142857 + 0.000000142857 + 0.000000000000142857 + ...\n\nwhich you can convert to fractions\n\n     142857*10^-7 + 142857*10^-14 + 142857*10^-21 + ...\n\nand since this is a converging infinite geometric series (basically, because there's a *pattern* to this sum, and because the sum tends to a finite value, you can actually [find the value of the sum](_URL_3_)), you can find that it converges (adds up) to:\n\n     142857*10^-7 / ( 1-10^-7 ) = 142857 / (10^7-1) = 142857 / 999999\n\nYou can show it more generally, but for the purpose of this post I won't get into that.\n\nSecond part:\n\nWe know that 142857 / 999999 = 1/7. Now, if we multiply this by 10, and take only the decimal portion, it's pretty obvious that we're just shifting the decimal point to the right by one number, chopping off the whole number, and repeating. The funky thing, though, is that if we do this, we *cycle* through a sequence:\n\n1. **1/7** \n1. - >  10/7 - >  **3/7** \n1. - >  30/7 - >  **2/7** \n1. - >  20/7 - >  **6/7** \n1. - >  60/7 - >  **4/7** \n1. - >  40/7 - >  **5/7** \n1. - >  50/7 - >  **1/7** \n1. - >  repeat *ad infinitum*.\n\nWhat's actually happening here is that we're cycling through the cyclic group of integers modulo 7, by multiplying by 10. For those normal people who've never been exposed to number theory before, this (only for the purposes of explanation - what's going on is indeed a bit more complicated) just means that you're doing normal arithmetic with the integers, except that every time you get a number greater than or equal to 7, you divide by 7, take the remainder, and continue working with the remainder. In other words, multiply 1 by 10, take the remainder after dividing by 7 to get 3, multiply 3 by 10, take the remainder after dividing by 7 to get 4, etc.\n\nI'm not going to delve into the specifics of *why* this cycling is happening (specifically, C_7 has 10 as a generator), but suffice it to say that it's this pattern which makes it possible to have the pattern that OP describes.\n\nIn fact, the next time this happens is for 142857142857, which is a factor of 999999999999, and I suspect that at least in base 10, this is *only* possible for numbers of this form."}

I've hear sociopaths are excellent at getting people to like them initially. The two seem to contradict eachother. answer: Hey! I can answer this question! I spend all day interviewing psychopaths for scientific research (note the username). Like others have said here, the answer lies in their egos. A key component of psychopathy is a thing called Grandiose Sense of Self Worth, which basically means that they think that they are a 10/10 all the time. This often translates to a very dynamic and attractive person. You know how people constantly say \"confidence is key\" when encouraging a shy guy to ask a girl out or something? The idea is that, if you appear confident, girls will pick up on that and be more attracted to you (and thus willing to accept your date request). Psychopaths RADIATE that confidence. They are 100% sure of themselves all the time, and that is pretty attractive. \n\nAlso, they lack empathy, but they are not stupid. It is pretty easy to understand that if you say the words \"I love you\" a girl will be more willing to sleep with you, then if you don't say those words. A psychopath would have no problem casually throwing \"I love you\" around just to get in someone's pants. They don't ever feel love, but saying the words requires no effort at all. \n\nHope that helps!"}

When I went to his house I was greeted by an man in his late eighties (a ww2 veteran himself and the women who took care of him. He showed me an album which he claimed showed the delivery of Germany's nuclear technology to Japan . He claimed he got the album from his cousin once he died, his cousin fought in Europe and he fought in the Pacific. The album showed the crew of German uboat in Japan. Even a picture of that famous mountain in japan from the top of the uboat along with other pictures of the crew with different Japanese soldiers. But there was one picture of particular interest which he showed me. He claimed that the picture was of Karl Doenitz in a Geisha house. While I cannot say with certainty that it was Karl Doentiz for sure I can tell you man had a resemblance as far as I could see. The problem with the photo was is that is was taken from the back profile so you couldn't see a face. He claimed that that photo was proof that this mission was to trasnfer Germany's nuclear technology to Japan, and the reason Nagaski and Hiroshima were bombed was because it was in one of these two cities in which the Japanese had their nuclear bomb being developed.

Scientists wanted built-up areas and terrains in order to increase the maximum damage done to enemy targets. Actually, Nagasaki wasn't supposed to be the primary target for the second bomb; originally Kokura was supposed to be the primary target, but the cloud over the city had extremely obscured the pilots' view so the pilot had to divert to the secondary target, Nagasaki, and the rest is history.\n\n* Not only that, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen for military and strategic purposes. Hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division, with 40,000 Japanese military personnel stationed in the city, and Nagasaki was a major industrial center that housed manufacturing facilities and cottage industries producing war materials and other equipment for the Japanese military. The goal in warfare was to reduce the enemy's capacity to produce war materials to the lower level as possible and to show the Japanese that we have the weapon that could destroy a city with a tick of a clock, in order to send a message to the Japanese government that such weapon would basically put the very end to the Japanese culture.\n\n* Last but not least, the goal in warfare was to prevent the invasion of the Japanese mainland that was set to start on November  1, 1945, with millions of American military personnel (going to be supplemented by American forces coming from Europe) tens of thousands of warships, and tens of thousands of military equipment to breakthrough Japan's heavy defenses and take control of entire areas that would have been taken over by the enemy."}

{"candidate": "question: Can cancerous tissue be introduced into our food chain?I was just wondering this morning, can cancerous tissue be present within the meats we eat, and if so what happens to the human body when it gets digested?\n answer: Sure. You've very likely eaten cancerous cells in your life. \n\nBut there's a few things that prevent it from forming cancers in our own bodies. \n\nFirst, we don't use their DNA. We use our own. Theirs is incompatible and so our cells don't use it for instructions.\n\nNext, it doesn't get into our cells intact in the first place. Our body digests cells and breaks them down, killing them and destroying their genetic instruction sets. Then the proteins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats and other stuff in them get delivered via bloodstream to where it's needed. The faulty DNA in those cells doesn't survive the conversion and trip. In a sense, it's like dismantling a lego model so you can put it back in its original box, then using the pieces to build something else instead later.", "reference": "question: Can cancerous tissue be introduced into our food chain?I was just wondering this morning, can cancerous tissue be present within the meats we eat, and if so what happens to the human body when it gets digested?\n answer: Well the good news is that you won't get cancer by eating cancer cells. \n\nNow, an interesting aside that is related to this question I think - there is a way you can contract a disease by eating other tissue that isn't filled with bacteria/virus - called prion disease. Prion diseases are usually spontaneous, with one protein in the brain malfolding to cause problems. Creutzfelt-Jacob Disease (CJD) is the classic example of this, and it is *very* rare. [Kuru](_URL_1_) and [Mad Cow Disease](_URL_0_) can be contracted when you consume animal or human parts that are contaminated by these malformed proteins. Speculation is that CJD victims in Papua New Guinea were consumed by family members in tribal cannibalism funeral tradition and this led to an epidemic of prion disease. \n\nSo your line of thinking is what led people to determine that this disease could be transmissible - something people took decades to figure out."}

{"candidate": "question: Why do we feel more uncomfortable viewing sex than viewing violence when others are around us? Given that sex is more natural than violence, shouldn't it be the opposite?[removed] answer: Well for the most part it has to do with cultural expectations and other stuff. Some places have lots more sex on tv and less violence on tv for cultural reasons (looking at u germany). \n\n*This is my very uneducated take on it from an individual level*. -- But i guess you could also describe the phenomena using neurology and psychology.

There are also vocabulary differences, so you can even think of it as a \"gay dialect\"... or, rather, a \"gay sociolect,\" since it's not tied to a geographical area. Most speakers are able to \"code switch\" - in essence, they can turn it on and off. It's a marker of identity. Lots of cultural groups have sociolects that they use to show membership in a group - think of BEV (Black English Vernacular aka Ebonics), or \"Valley Girl\" speech, or the l337speak used online.\n\n > As far as history, some linguists say that the gay accent was influenced by the California accent, since California was the heart of the early gay rights movement in the US. But a \"gay dialect\" actually goes back a lot farther than that! The British dialect of Polari[1] might go back to the 16th century. Polari actually sounds a bit like what we'd call a \"gay accent\" today, and it has its roots in a combination of Roma argot, Cockney rhymbing slang, and exaggerated, singsong theatrical speech (think the old Punch and Judy puppet shows). Polari almost completely died out in the 1960s and 70s, though, as it started to be seen as a negative stereotype. But quite a lot of Polari words are still in use (such as \"drag,\" which comes from the Romani word \"indraka,\" or \"skirt.\")"}

{"candidate": "question: American Football for an Englishman.I know absolutely nothing about it answer: It's sort of like rugby, except the players line up before each play and there are stricter rules about contact.\n\nEach team gets four tries, or 'downs' to move the ball as far as possible down the field. They can do this by handing the ball to a fast player,  the 'running back', or by throwing it to a receiver down the field. The thrower is called the quarterback. A down is over when the player currently holding the ball is tackled. If the team can move forward ten yards in four downs, the counter for downs starts over.  \n\nOne touchdown (moving the ball to the other end of the field) is worth 6 points. After that , the team can either kick the ball through the upright goal to gain another point, or try to run the ball past the other team for another two points. \n\nAfter 4 downs or a touchdown, the ball is given to the other team for their attempt at a goal.", "reference": "question: American Football for an Englishman.I know absolutely nothing about it answer: Football is like war.\n\nYou have 2 sides. We'll call one side the British and the other side the Scotts. The Scotts are trying to get a special \"package\" behind the British line. Keep in mind, there are special rules of war, but the basic concept is that each side will try to guess how the other side will line up the troops. The Scotts are trying to line up their troops to exploit weaknesses in the British defense and the British are trying set up defense that will effectively counter the Scotts' offensive. If the Scotts successfully get the package across the British lines, then they get 6 points. They can then try to kick the package through the enemy headquarters window for an additional point.\n\nNow the Scotts have 4 attempts to move the package 10 yards. If by the 3rd attempt there is no chance to move the package the requisite distance, then they have a choice. If they are close enough, they can attempt to kick the package through the window for only 3 points. If they are too far, then they want to kick the package as far back to the enemy line as possible where the British can then pick the package up and attempt to do the same to the Scotts.\n\nThere are a few additional things...but that's the basic concept."}

With many investors choosing where to put their money, the theory is that this will result in the most worthwhile and beneficial projects receiving the most capital. \n\nThe incentive is pretty simple. If you direct your capital to a project you believe in (by buying a share of stock), you can later sell it for more money, once that enterprise has used your money to become successful. Or you can keep it and be entitled to a portion of the enterprise's proceeds (dividends).\n\nAnd for the most part, it works. The tricky part is that it leverages greed.

When it is still in my wallet?How does this sort of fraud work? Where did they get the credit card number? How did they use it at these places without a physical card? Can anyone break down the process for me? I'm just curious. answer: At some point while you were out, the information on your credit card was copied. The attacker probably made a fake duplicate card, and then began making purchases elsewhere. Info in the magnetic stripe on cards is not encrypted, and can be easily read with a magstripe reader. The magnetic stripe contains the same information that is printed on the front of the card.\n\nLast December, a large volume of credit card information was stolen from Target - this is on the large scale. It happens on the small scale also when a local business stores customer information in an insecure fashion. I've also heard stories of dishonest cashiers or waiters who have stolen customer card information to then sell it on the internet.\n\nEDIT: Like the other replies said, definitely contact your credit card company and report the charges as fraudulent.

When international conflicts arise they have remained neutral on the matter. Concurrently there business and industry institutions have developed with public funding and mandates. Their educational system specializes it's students to their specific interests contrast to the US where students learn the same material up until college or upper level education. The German economy is based around specialized capitalism that keeps the government and business sectors separated yet regulated. Also up until the mid 2000s NATO had military restrictions on the German wehrmacht (Army).  So obviously no taxes levied on defense programs. Most importantly though is their neutrality on contemporary conflicts. Look at history for nations who remained neutral and built up internally rather than externally. The US in the 1920s when we were full on isolationist was our greatest peak of success. Unfortunately the factors leading into the great depression wrecked our economy and the rest of the world but that's economics for ya. Switzerland has never really been in a full on conflict with another nation thus have internally built up it's infrastructure.

[This equation solves the power lost as heat due to Joule Heating.](_URL_5_)\nTherefore, for given Current and conductor resistance, power lost as heat is HUGE as current increases.\n\nPower Received = Power Generated - Power Lost during transmission. \nTherefore if the sending voltage is low, the current will have to be high make up for low voltage, but it'll all get lost in the form of heat and not much will get to the end point. That's also the reason  why it make sense for main power lines have extremely high voltage."}

Do they somehow filter meat from water or do they just swallow it all? answer: Hi! I'm a Marine Bio student and I think I can answer the part of your question pertaining to sharks. Sharks can regulate their internal salt content through what's called a rectal gland. Essentially they process the salt to keep their bodies at a Hyposmotic state, so that way Water can diffuse through their skin and into their systems. The rectal gland essentially let's them excrete any of the salt they do not need to maintain the osmoregularity.

You don't have money for luxuries, but you can probably keep yourself sheltered in some capacity (even if it's just a rented room). You probably can't save much. A tax burden of 10% would have a *huge* impact on your quality of life. Now, you're effectively making $10,800, which is below the poverty line. You went from just scraping by to maybe getting evicted. \n\nIf you're making 50,000/year, that same tax takes you down to 45,000. It might affect the car you buy or how many rooms your house/apartment has, but it's not affecting your ability to keep sheltered, clothed, and fed. \n\nIf you're making 100,000/year, that tax takes you down to 90,000. There is little impact on your lifestyle at this point. Maybe you can only buy a new car every three or four years, or you vacation in Hawaii instead of Europe. \n\nIf you're making 1,000,000/year, you pay 100,000 and take home 900,000.

One is a cost to benefit scenario, in which it may not be beneficial to wear head gear, thus limiting your awareness and vision on the off chance that you get shot in the head. It turns out that a HUGE number of people just plain can't shoot well enough to hit a guy in the head. The benefits of a helmet are really not all that great either. If you get hit squarely in the head, even while wearing a helmet, the kinetic energy is still likely to snap your neck or break your skull (IF the helmet stops the round which is a big IF).\n\nThe other reason is societal. People don't want to see police officers riding around with helmets on, because they look too much like soldiers. With societies view on the militarization of the police already frowning on that, this would make it much worse."}

You may think there is an objective standard of which we can judge if something is true or not, but there really isn't. We have our scientific models of reality but it's still growing, expanding, evolving - which means throughout history there has been always been things that our scientific models have failed to address or considered false/incorrect/irrational - that later turned out to be true, following a higher form of rationality.\n\nCouple that with the fact that institutions and power structures form around scientific models and modes of thought, you get a situation where new standards to which judge truths are resisted. It's why wars and revolutions have been accompaning huge shifts in our understanding / consciousness... and pioneers of thought has been derided, called liars, demonized, defamed, villanized, etc. and don't think we are above that yet. It's simply arrogance to think that we have a complete model of reality today to which we can judge things as objectively true or false. \n\nThere are also various ways to look at reality. E.g. if I say the universe revolves around earth, you may be correct in viewing that as an archaic or overly complicated model (when making certain predictions). But you'd be wrong to call it false - it's just a different frame of reference. Trouble is that most people would call it false.", "reference": "question: Why can politicians get away with telling blatant lies?[removed] answer: Because it is almost impossible to make sure you are telling the truth 100% all the time, simply because person can not know everything but has to make assumptions and guesses.

We can't always wait how thing turn out and then knowing what should've been done is kind of stupid.\n\nPoliticians just started running wild with that excuse more and more in the last 2 decades and voters do not seem to care.

They seem fairly decoupled in that direction (obviously the reverse is not true, markets do depend on consumer spending) answer: Wow. Okay. Let me see if I can sum up.\n\nAncient Rome went through three distinct political structures. First it was a monarchy, then a republic, and then an empire. Really, though, that last one goes through several phases and differentiations in structure, but histories still generally refer to three phases total.\n\nThe monarchy was, well, a monarchy. Rome was ruled by a king. There was a Senate that acted as an advisory body, but had no actual lawmaking ability. Then, according to legend, there were a couple really bad kings in a row, including one that was so bad that it caused an uprising. They kicked him out (Tarquinius Superbus) and swore that Rome would never again be ruled by a king.\n\nThat set up the Roman Republic. The Senate became a de facto law-making body (really, the situation is a bit more complex, but no need to get into that now) with two Consuls acting as chief executives. The idea was that no one person would have supreme power. Consuls were elected annually. The Republic went through quite a few changes and additions, but that general structure endured up until the first century BCE.\n\nA series of civil wars and some other political developments caused power to get concentrated increasingly into the hands of a few individuals, while the Senate kept losing influence. At least some of these people wanted supreme power. Notably, part of the reason for the assassination of Julius Caesar was fear that he would proclaim himself king--something no good Roman citizen could bear. \n\nLong story short, after the shakeup Augustus Caesar ended up on top, holding nearly all the power in his own hands. We call this the beginning of the Roman Empire. It was a gradual process, but mainly from this point forward we see one ruler with supreme power in charge of Rome, with the power usually hereditary. Historians refer to that person as the Emperor, though a number of titles were actually used at various times. Technically, there still was a Senate, and *technically* they were still in charge. Augustus said he was \"restoring the Roman Republic,\" even as he was essentially ending it. Over time, the pretense dropped more and more.\n\nNow, where things sometimes get confusing in common discourse is that a lot of people use \"Roman Empire\" to mean \"the extent of territory conquered by Rome\" rather than this third phase of governance. Really, though, most of the territory Rome would rule was conquered during the Republic, though the borders did expand quite a bit under the Empire.\n\nEventually, the territory governed by the Empire got huge. The Romans were never really that great at administration anyway, and the difficulties in communication over so vast a distance were causing problems. To solve this, a second capital city was established at Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople. Effectively, the Empire was divided in half, with different administrative authorities running the western and eastern halves. This eastern half is what's known as the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nWhen we talk about the \"fall of the Roman Empire,\" what we really mean is the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Things kind of spiraled downward for a while, then some Germanic barbarians sacked the city of Rome itself and essentially knocked the whole system down. When that happened, though, there was still that eastern capital and eastern half of the Empire. That pretty much kept chugging along just fine for a long time to come. Again, we often refer to that as the Byzantine Empire, but really it's just the eastern half of Rome's territory.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire came much later. The Frankish King Charlemagne conquered/united a bunch of kingdoms in modern-day France, Germany, and Italy. Later, the rulers of this kingdom started referring to it as the Holy Roman Empire, attempting to say that they were the descendants in power of Rome. Really, though, this was just an attempt to grant some legitimacy and prestige, rather than any actual relation to Ancient Rome. As Voltaire famously remarked, it \"was neither holy, nor Roman, nor empire.\"\n\nHope this helps clear things up a little!", "reference": "question: Why do analysts believe that people will buy less in the short term after a stock market drop?In articles like [this](_URL_0_) the author implies that the average consumer is watching the market like a hawk and will suddenly spend less if the market drops, but most consumers don't have any savings or investments, so why do analysts think those people will care about a market drop?

{"candidate": "question: The legal concept of bail. How can a court justify releasing a potentially harmful person for a large sum of cash? answer: In the US you're considered innocent until proven guilty, so you have to give the defendant an option to fight their charges from the street, but there also has to be an incentive to show back up for court. Here in the US you have monetary bail conditions and non-monetary bail conditions. Non-monetary conditions are just that, no money involved.  These conditions can include house arrest with an ankle monitor, drug and alcohol treatment with random testing, having to stay away from a business you allegedly stole from or a person you allegedly assaulted, etc. Monetary bail is issued at an arraignment or prelim and is usually set after considering  the severity of the crime and an offender's previous criminal record. A judge might make somebody pay cash bail, which is the full amount, or 10%, which is just a percentage. In most cases, if a person is in compliance on bail (not incurring new charges, generally obeying the rules of society) they get their money back after trial.  If not, they forfeit the posted bail and go back to jail. Additionally, a person could get unsecured bail with a monetary number attached. An example would be $2,500 un-secured. This mean that a person is released on the condition he/she remain in compliance with the law.  If they don't comply with the bail regulations, then they could be remitted to jail, and then they would have to pay the full $2,500 to get back out. \n\nEdit. And of course all this depends on the municipality, county, state/commonwealth you're in, which there are numerous of.", "reference": "question: The legal concept of bail. How can a court justify releasing a potentially harmful person for a large sum of cash? answer: Bail not just giving a large sum of cash.\n\nBail is the court saying \"we want to let you chill and live your life until your trial, since by our legal system you are innocent until proven guilty, but we are worried you are going to flee.  Give us 10,000 dollars that you get back if you show up but lose if you don't, and we will trust you to stay.\n\nBail bond companies will front this money to someone, but if you don't show up for court, they won't get their money but are legally allowed to hunt you, bring you back to the courts, and get their money.  They usually charge a flat fee for this service on the understanding that they WILL hunt you and find you if you go fugitive and your life will be a lot worse than if you just show and face the music.\n\nSource:  I was accused of something I didn't do, and had my bail set at 10,000.  I was given as much time as I needed to call bail bondsmen (the jail had a special office for this with a list and a counselor to help people that don't know the process) for free until I found one that was available to take my case.  They charged ~300 dollars, and I never heard from them again because I walked out of jail later that day and the state didn't press any charges because I didn't do anything wrong.

TWO DAYS LATER the chips I put in the zip locked bags are STALE. 2 WEEKS later, the chips in the original bag are not stale.I thought I would be saving money, saving the chips in fresh zip locked bags, but no. Stale as Hell. I am old. I don't do it anymore, I'm just wondering why, when I leave the family sized bag folded over/barely closed, WHY do they still taste fresh, and my \"freshly\" sealed goes bad within 2-3 days? Cheers! answer: There are at least two reasons.\n\nAs other people have mentioned, zip-loc bags, made from cheap plastic (LDPE or whatever), are not impermeable to oxygen or water. Some will eventually get through. The inside foil lining of your chip bag is much, much better at keeping the outside air out.\n\nHowever, even though a zip-loc bag is comparatively terrible as a diffusion barrier, it is still pretty good. I'd have a hard time believing that a zip-loc bag would allow that much moisture in to render chips stale in two days. \n\nWhich brings me to the second reason:\n\nThere are a lot more chips in the chips bag than in the zip-loc bag. I'm guessing the zip-loc baggies don't contain many chips, because the bag can only stretch so wide, and chips are irregularly-shaped. So the air-to-chips ratio in the baggies is pretty high. Contrast that to the family-sized bag, which probably has a lot more chips, and only a bit more air.\n\nWhy does this matter? It is possible, if the air is humid enough, and the air-to-chips ratio high enough, for your chips to go stale simply due to the moisture in the air already in the bag. The chips in the bag won't have this problem, as there are so many chips, each individual chip won't get a lot of moisture. As a bonus, most chip bags come filled with nitrogen, which is slightly heaver than air. Although it will eventually diffuse out, that initial, moisture-free nitrogen will linger for a while, giving your chip bag chips a nice advantage as well.", "reference": "question: I open a big bag of chips, Family sized. I take my portion, and also fill 3 zip lock baggies with those freshly opened chips.

What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling answer: In addition to everything what my predecessors have said, there is - I believe - an urgent geopolitical motive that reaches far beyond Ukraine. Sevastopol, in addition to everything that's been said, serves another important purpose right now - it ensures that Black Sea fleet will still be able to freely maneuver in this area. Keep in mind that this is very important for Syria war at the moment. Remember that it was quick tactical movement of Russian Black Sea fleet that prevented French and US navy from aiding anti-government forces in Syrian civil war. Such aid could have swayed the force balance in the conflict and Russia doesn't want allow it. Sevastopol is essential in Syrian conflict if Russia wants it to play by their rules. Now try to think as Putin for a moment, how would you feel when not so long after you stopped the West from aiding Syria, a revolution starts in Ukraine that overthrows government and installs pro-west one instead. To Russia it must have been obvious conclusion that this is how the west was trying to undermine their presence in the Black Sea and open their way to Syria. I'm not trying to justify Putin's actions, but I can see why he might have felt so bothered. An why is Syria that important is whole other story.", "reference": "question: What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country?

The same thing happened with the Syria situation.\n\n\nThe US consistently exercises its superpower \"rights\", and this gives them incredible advantages outside the realm of just making decisions for others. They can barter incredible deals, with huge gains for the US, by deciding on issues that don't concern the US in the slightest. Russia wants a piece of that action, by getting to the same \"decider\" level superpower status.\n\n\nYou can't get there by simply looking big on a map. A show of force is needed. When the next Assad thinks about whose support he's gonna get against western pressure, Russia becomes more of a viable option with every time Putin shows his middle finger to the world."}

What's the upside to all this for them when all they seem to have done is anger everyone?\n\nEdit - spelling answer: This is how I understand the situation:\n\nThe US have funded the opposition in order to have their people ruling the government. I didn't believe when people were saying that the US sponsor most of the revolutions alike, but after I heard this hacked phone call, during which Victoria Nuland and American ambassador to Ukraine decide whom should they put in charge in Ukraine, I started to believe that without the US none of this would have happened.\n\nthis is their conversation: _URL_21_\n\nthis is the transcript: _URL_22_\n\nThe same woman was giving out cookies (literally) to protesters of Maidan, showing them her support.\n\nPutin has realized that if he will let this happen, Ukraine will be\u0441ome a branch office of the US, which probably means that they will build another NATO base right next to Russia's border and probably remove Russian Black Sea fleet from the Black Sea region.\n\nSo he had to react, because not paying attention would be suicidal for Russia (in the long term).\n\nCrimea region always has had close ties with Russia, because more than a half of its population are Russians. The first thing new government did after they've gained some power - they worsened the status of Russian language. Before the revolution Russian language used to be an official regional language in some states, but it's not anymore. I think it was a very stupid move, because I believe a lot of Russians started panicking about becoming sort of a second class citizens, like Russians in the Baltic States. New government is saying they didn't mean it, but it doesn't look good when the first thing you do is focus on worsening the status of the Russian language, whilst the country is having tons of other REAL problems. Their actions spoke louder than their words.\n\nThis is how, I think, Crimea has become even more loyal to Russia. Not all of them of course.\n\nI think what Russia is currently trying to do, is make Crimea region sort of independent from pro-Western Kyiv. I don't think they are trying to annex it or make it a part of Russia, they just want to reduce Kyiv's (read American) influence, so the Black Sea fleet could stay where it is.", "reference": "question: What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country?

{"candidate": "question: What were the driving factors that caused the Occupy Wall Street movement to fizzle out? answer: I use to lead a protest group, so I can venture a guess as to why OWS failed. They fell pray to the problem that hinders a lot of social and protest movements. They had no strong leaders who could bring the gap between their group and the rest of society. They didn't have anyone who could speak in a way that made sense to people outside the group. Anyone can pander to the OWS believers, but it takes a true leader to lead the group against the entrenched interests. They didn't have one, or more likely, the real leaders were pushed out by charlatans who just wanted attention.\n\nSo OWS was essentially a chicken running around without its head. Liberal people tend to hate power hierarchies, which is why most of their movements tend to go no where in America. The instant someone becomes a real leader they yell \"informal leadership\" or \"patriarchy\" or \"oppression.\" I know this from first hand experience. I founded and led a protest group. We went from a couple of people to over 150 members in less than a year. We were a powerful group in the community, and we got results. Then me and the other leaders were forced out of leadership roles, because it was suppose to be a \"flat non-hierarchical\" group. The group disbanded with 6 months. We went from one of the most powerful groups in the community to nothing in a matter of months. Social movements are very fragile things. Sometimes it takes a strong hands-on leader to move the group together in the right direction. Don't tell any OWSers that or they will yell \"Oppressor.\"", "reference": "question: What were the driving factors that caused the Occupy Wall Street movement to fizzle out? answer: Because people cared more about being inconvenienced by hippies than they did with the banks fucking around with money."}

The first brain sends HINTS about where you are without telling the alien too much information.", "reference": "question: How do video games play \"hide and seek\"? The game knows where your position is, how does it act like it doesn't know where you are? answer: The \"AI\" in video games is just a subroutine that chooses an action based on available information. It won't act on information that isn't sent to that subroutine, even if that information exists somewhere else in the program. So the game engine provides some way of defining the \"senses\" of AI-controlled entities, usually in terms of vision and maybe sound. So if the player character is hiding behind something, with an AI-controlled entity on the other side, then the rules for \"senses\" in the game engine will say that the AI-controlled entity cannot \"see\" the player character, and so the player's location is reported to the AI subroutine as \"unknown\", even though it is clearly known to the physics and graphics parts of the game. The AI will usually have some kind of \"fallback\" behavior in this case, either waiting where it is or walking around on some kind of search pattern until the game engine decides that it can \"see\" the player character.\n\nBasically, the AI in the game acts like a different \"player\" from the part of the game engine that basically serves as a \"referee\". The AI, like human players, can only act on limited information, whereas the \"referee\" parts of the game engine know everything that goes on in the game world, but does not cause \"cheating\" because it is impartial and does not act in the favor of either the player or the AI (assuming the game engine is designed to be \"fair\" in that way)."}

{"candidate": "question: How come theme parks can snap clear pictures and get good quality footage of people going up to 70mph but bank cameras can't get a clear shot of a robber standing still? answer: Highest upvoted comment is simply wrong. This is a matter of lighting. Theme park cameras use flash. Banks are indoors and much darker than outdoors - but humans don't realize this because our eyes adjust. Ask any professional photographer and it's a night and day difference of indoor with lights on vs outdoor natural lighting. Just take a picture yourself with a camera and check the ISO the camera auto-selects. Again, humans can't tell the difference but indoor lighting is much harder to take a good picture than outdoors because of brightness.\n\nDon't believe me? Take a good camera, and take photos of a basketball game indoors. 90% of your pictures will be bad because your camera has to turn down the shutter speed drastically just to even capture enough light. Take that same camera, take any picture outdoors. It'll be crystal sharp even if someone's running. Now add flash and it's even 10x easier to get a sharp picture. This is why if professionally people use $10K+ cameras+lens to take photos of basketball games, but a much cheaper camera can take the same quality shots outdoors.\n\nAlso, bank cameras are 'just good enough' for their value and intended use. Theme park cameras are as well, and have a huge advantage in that they use flash. It's about 20x-50x brighter flash vs indoors.", "reference": "question: How come theme parks can snap clear pictures and get good quality footage of people going up to 70mph but bank cameras can't get a clear shot of a robber standing still? answer: People on a roller coaster, say, are always the same distance from the camera.

{"candidate": "question: How does the slant of the blade on a guillotine lead to a cleaner cut?Does it have something to do with pressure, or am I way off here? answer: Think of how you'd use a knife to cut something tough in the kitchen, like say, a potato.  Now, you could swing the knife forcefully to chop it in half, but  unless you're very good, you're not going to cut exactly where you wanted to, you'll also risk chopping off your fingers or damaging your knife, which would be bad.  The proper way to slice is to place the blade on the item in question, and apply regular downward pressure while pulling/pushing the blade towards/away from you.  This lets the blade act like a blade rather than just a wedge.  The principle is the same with the guillotine.  The lower part of the blade makes contact with the chap's neck first, and because the blade is slanted, it slides *relatively* along his neck.   The point of contact between the blade and the neck moves in 2 dimensions, rather than just one, even though the blade is only moving in one dimension.", "reference": "question: How does the slant of the blade on a guillotine lead to a cleaner cut?Does it have something to do with pressure, or am I way off here? answer: I believe it is generally about combining the effects of slicing through an object and chopping through it.\n\nFirst we need to think of the concept of sharpness, where a surface is sharp when it has as small a surface area making contact with another surface. A needle is sharper than a blade, because it only makes contact at a single point, but a blade is more effective at cutting because the linear path of the edge creates a clean straight path that the rest of the blade can continue to be drawn through when cutting, whereas the point of the needle digs into the surface it's penetrating and resists being drawn in any direction.\n\nChopping can be thought of as applying a direct pressure of a bladed edge on a surface, hoping for the kinetic energy of the blade, and the sharpness of the cutting surface to drive a wedge far enough through the object to sever it. Chopping action basically stops once all the kinetic energy has been imparted, and you have to pull the blade back out and try again if you didn't make it all the way through. The less sharp the blade, and the more tough the surface, the less likely it'll get through, and probably just crush it somewhat.\n\nSlicing, on the other hand, is about drawing a sharp edge across the surface, trying to minimize the amount of edge-to-surface contact as possible (which effectively increases the sharpness), and allows more of the length of the blade to be used in the cutting action. Basically, slicing can be conducted for the full length of the blade, and the less of the blade making contact at any given time means the slicing is more effective. Slicing is most effective when the direction of the cut is not traveling straight through the surface, but drawing against it at an angle.\n\nYou can try this, take a pair of scissors or a straight edged knife, place one edge of the blade flat against a piece of paper and try to cut it just by driving the edge straight through. If this doesn't work so well, try placing the blade against the edge of the paper (minimizing the contact surface) and drawing the blade through it. It should slice much more easily this way.\n\nNow, onto Guillotines. They work by combining both chopping and slicing. The momentum of the blade falling is the chop. The angle of the blade allows the slicing action to be concentrated on a single point of the neck at any given time, and extends the length of the blade during the slice as it both drives and draws through. It also makes the direction of most resistance no longer ~~perpendicular~~ directly opposed to the blade as it moves, which is what would make it most likely to resist the cutting action.\n\n**TL;DR**: momentum of blade = chopping, angle of blade = slicing + longer cutting edge + non-perpendicular angle of resistance. Chopping + slicing = quicker, cleaner, more effective cut"}
{"candidate": "question: how do groups like ISIS attract middle class westerners to their cause, and why are they mostly male? answer: Many devote muslims, even fanatics are women but they typically aren't used as fighters for the same reasons why warriors have traditionally been male in all cultures.  Those reasons are compounded by the fact that extremest Islam is very hostile to the idea of women leaving \"their place.\"\n\nIt's not common for ISIS and groups like it to recruit people from middle class.  Most are from slums that never really integrated into the country the immigrated to.  The few that were better off (which likely includes the British man who executed that Journalist) are likely motivated by strong religious convictions.\n\nWhy educated people develop fanatical religious convictions is a whole other big topic that I won't go into right now.", "reference": "question: how do groups like ISIS attract middle class westerners to their cause, and why are they mostly male? answer: With so many tens of millions of middle-class people, you're going to have a couple who are mentally ill or have such dysfunctional lives that they do incredibly foolish things.

The bladder has stretch receptors (mechanoreceptors) that give input to the autonomic system. The dominant autonomic tone is a result of the amount of stretch input (little stretch of bladder - >  sympathetic tone, detrusor muscle and internal sphincter are inhibited, bladder is allowed to fill; more stretch - >  parasympathetic tone, detrusor and internal sphincter stimulated, voiding occurs). In infants and some people with spinal cord injury, this is the only control of the bladder. This is refered to as \"neurogenic\" - voiding occurs upon sufficient stretch. Beginning in childhood, the central nervous system is involved to allow for conscious control of voiding. The urge to pee comes from afferent input to the pontine micturition center."}
